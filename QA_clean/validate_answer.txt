about half of women (i am assuming you are female) who experience classic symptoms of a uti do not really have one. your negative cultures and uas tend to support that there is another reason for your symptoms. burning on urination can be urethritis (irritation of your urinary opening) caused by any number of things from sexual activity irritation from soaps chemical reactions or vaginal infections. blood can be caused by irritation as well but since this has been going on for over a month and has not be solved perhaps a higher level exam by a urologist would be prudent.
this could be a condition called hidradenitis suppurativa which could occur at any time. it is a scarring condition of recurrent boils in the groin under the bra line and even at the underarm region. it may be worse due to hormonal imbalance and weight gain. there are oral and topical treatments your dermatologist would be able to offer to help control the condition and minimize scarring.
the amount of exercise you would need per week depends on your overall health and fitness goals. the american college of sports medicine recommends at least  minutes of moderate intensity (brisk walking) exercise per week for general heart health. if you want to lose weight  minutes a week or more is suggested. aerobic exercise can be broken into  minute bouts adding up to  minutes as long as the  minute sessions are at moderate intensity.

there are many causes for itchy scalps but dry skin would be high on the list as well as chemical sensitivity reactions (to shampoo) fungal scalp infections and yes even head lice. it is not possible to determine a specific cause based on itching alone. he will need to see a medical provider or dermatologist for a proper examination but in the meantime he can try some medicated over-the-counter shampoo used for dry scalp conditions to see if it helps. a pharmacist can help him chose a proper one.

a minimally thickened cord is of questionable importance. please get your urine analysis also. idiopathic orchialgia is very common in young people. i suggest you wear scrotal support. the testes carry a spiral muscle called cremaster with them while coming out of the abdomen to lie in the scrotum at the birth of a male child. the testes are in a dynamic position hanging in the scrotum. they adjust according to stimulus like temperature change touch and excitation. in some young people this causes pain due to strong muscles. with aging this decreases. if it bothers a lot then you may need treatment. keep them close to the body by using scrotal support. this is neuropathic pain so i suggest tablet pregabalin as and when required. consult your doctor discuss with him or her and take medicine with consent. treatment plan:continue antibiotics for  days. it takes time to resolve the pain of epididymitis may be four weeks. regarding follow up:for further information consult a urologist online. ---> <link>

sure. but not during an active outbreak.
you suspect an outbreak is beginning. if you take antiviral drugs in the early stages you may shorten the course of the infection. shingles on your face spreads near your eye. seek treatment from an eye doctor (ophthalmologist) to avoid possible cornea damage. the affected area becomes secondarily infected with bacteria (indicated by spreading redness swelling a high fever and pus). antibiotics can help halt the spread of bacterial infection but not the shingles itself. your rash lasts longer than  days without improvement. get treatment to avoid potential nerve damage. the pain becomes too great to bear. your doctor may prescribe stronger painkillers or a nerve block.

you have most likely been exposed already but not all people who are exposed with get shingles or in your case chicken pox. many people have antibiotics against chicken pox with only having a mild case in the past and not being diagnosed. if he has active shingles (herpes zoster) now he is contagious from direct contact with skin to skin or through fomites (items contaminated from active lesions like clothing or objects). shingles is not airborne. consider him contagious until his lesions resolve and go get a vaccine. just in case. disinfect any potentially contaminated things with a bleach solution or lysol spray.
one more thing that i would like to add is that you should discuss about immunotherapy with your allergist that will help in reducing the severity and frequency of allergic attack.
hi you do not need total work off but if possible a few days of rest can help. take healthy diet associated with protein supplements. do not eat spicy / junk food. thanks
for the majority of children suffering hair loss one of the following conditions is the cause. your child's pediatrician or a pediatric dermatologist should be able to diagnose these conditions and prescribe the appropriate treatment. tinea capitis. tinea capitis commonly known as ringworm of the scalp is a fungal infection often seen in children. it can show up in a number of ways but often as scaly patches of hair loss on the head. the patches are usually round or oval. the hairs may be broken off at the surface of the skin and look like black dots on the scalp. because ringworm is contagious your child should be careful not to share any objects that touch the head such as hats pillow cases or brushes. alopecia areata. alopecia areata is a non-contagious condition of hair loss thought to be caused by the body's immune system attacking the hair follicles. it is characterized by the sudden appearance of round or oval patches of hair loss. the patches are slick or smooth without scaling or broken hairs. about % of children also have pitting and ridging of the nails. while there is no cure for alopecia areata treatment can control the disease in some children. many have their hair back within a year although regrowth is unpredictable and many will lose hair again. for about % of children the disease progresses to alopecia totalis -- loss of all of the hair on the scalp. some of these will develop alopecia universalis -- a total loss of body hair. trichotillomania. trichotillomania is hair loss caused by pulling plucking twisting or rubbing. the hair loss is patchy and characterized by broken hairs of varying length. patches are typically seen on the side of the child's dominant hand. trichotillomania may be triggered by a stressor in your child's life such as the loss of a grandparent birth of a sibling or a divorce. if you notice your child pulling hair scolding will not likely be helpful. however counseling to help your child deal with the source of stress that triggered the habit may help stop it. telogen effluvium. telogen effluvium is a condition in which a sudden or severe stress -- such as extremely high fever surgery under general anesthesia the death of a loved one a severe injury or the use of certain prescription medications -- interrupts the normal cycle of hair growth. the hair follicles stop growing prematurely and enter a resting phase (called the telogen phase). between six and  weeks later hair sheds excessively leading to partial or complete baldness. there are no conclusive tests to diagnose telogen effluvium; there is also no treatment for it. however once the stressful event is over full hair growth usually returns within six months to a year. nutritional deficiency. though less common hair loss can be a symptom of deficiencies in certain nutrients including: vitamin h or biotin one of the b complex of vitamins which help the body to convert carbohydrates into glucose to fuel the body. zinc an essential mineral involved in numerous aspects of cellular metabolism. it also supports normal growth and development during pregnancy childhood and adolescence. in some cases hair loss can be a symptom of too much vitamin a. with a healthy varied diet most children will not experience nutritional deficiencies that lead to hair loss. however if you suspect a problem speak to your child's doctor before giving nutritional supplements. endocrine problems. in some children the cause of hair loss is hypothyroidism a condition in which the thyroid is underactive and is producing an insufficient amount of thyroid hormones required for regulating metabolism. a diagnosis of hypothyroidism is made by a blood test and possibly a scan of the thyroid gland.
irritable bowel syndrome. irritable bowel syndrome is a functional cause of diarrhea or constipation. inflammation does not typically exist in the affected bowel. (nevertheless recent information suggests that there may be a component of inflammation in ibs. ) it may be caused by several different underlying problems but it is believed that the most common cause is rapid passage of the intestinal contents through the colon. infectious diseases. there are a few infectious diseases that can cause chronic diarrhea for example giardia lamblia. patients with aids often have chronic infections of their intestines that cause diarrhea. bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine. because of small intestinal problems normal colonic bacteria may spread from the colon and into the small intestine. when they do they are in a position to digest food that the small intestine has not had time to digest and absorb. the mechanism that leads to the development of diarrhea in bacterial overgrowth is not known. post-infectious. following acute viral bacterial or parasitic infections some individuals develop chronic diarrhea. the cause of this type of diarrhea is not clear but some of the individuals have bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine. this condition also is referred to as post-infectious ibs. inflammatory bowel disease. crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis diseases causing inflammation of the small intestine and/or colon commonly cause chronic diarrhea. colon cancer. colon cancer can cause either diarrhea or constipation. if the cancer blocks the passage of stool it usually causes constipation. sometimes however there is secretion of water behind the blockage and liquid stool from behind the blockage leaks around the cancer and results in diarrhea. cancer particularly in the distal part of the colon can lead to thin stools. cancer in the rectum can lead to a sense of incomplete evacuation. severe constipation. by blocking the colon hardened stool can lead to the same problems as colon cancer. carbohydrate (sugar) malabsorption. carbohydrate or sugar malabsorption is an inability to digest and absorb sugars. the most well-recognized malabsorption of sugar occurs with lactase deficiency (also known as lactose or milk intolerance) in which milk products containing the milk sugar lactose lead to diarrhea. the lactose is not broken up in the intestine because of the absence of an intestinal enzyme lactase that normally breaks up lactose. without being broken up lactose cannot be absorbed into the body. the undigested lactose reaches the colon and pulls water (by osmosis) into the colon. this leads to diarrhea. although lactose is the most common form of sugar malabsorption other sugars in the diet also may cause diarrhea including fructose and sorbitol. fat malabsorption. malabsorption of fat is the inability to digest or absorb fat. fat malabsorption may occur because of reduced pancreatic secretions that are necessary for normal digestion of fat (for example due to pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer) or by diseases of the lining of the small intestine that prevent the absorption of digested fat (for example celiac disease). undigested fat enters the last part of the small intestine and colon where bacteria turn it into substances (chemicals) that cause water to be secreted by the small intestine and colon. passage through the small intestine and colon also may be more rapid when there is malabsorption of fat. endocrine diseases. several endocrine diseases (imbalances of hormones) may cause diarrhea for example an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) and an underactive pituitary or adrenal gland (addison's disease). laxative abuse. the abuse of laxatives by individuals who want attention or to lose weight is an occasional cause of chronic diarrhea.
yes. the vaccine does not prevent an infection from every strain of rotavirus; just the more common ones.
as you had taken one unwanted  within  hours after the intercourse you must have received a withdrawal bleed after - days. if yes then the date of the withdrawal bleed would form your fresh lmp (last menstrual period) and you should be starting your count for next menses from that date. as the pregnancy tests are negative you are not pregnant from that sexual encounter. hence considering the possible withdrawal bleed your next menses should start only by now. as you have started experiencing mild cramping and vaginal mucoid discharge which are part of pms (premenstrual syndrome) it is indicative that you will start your menses soon. hence please be patient for another one week and you will get your menses. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>
most episodes of diarrhea are acute and of short duration and do not require antibiotics. antibiotics are not even necessary for the most common bacterial infections that cause diarrhea. antibiotics however often are used when () patients have more severe and persistent diarrhea () patients have additional debilitating diseases such as heart failure lung disease and aids () stool examination and testing discloses parasites more serious bacterial infections (for example shigella ) or c. difficile and ) traveler's diarrhea.

after vasectomy the testes continue to make sperm. when the sperm cells die they are absorbed by the body much like unused sperm in a nonvasectomized man. nevertheless many vasectomized men develop immune reactions to sperm although current evidence indicates that these reactions do not cause any harm. ordinarily sperm do not come into contact with immune cells so they do not elicit an immune response. but vasectomy breaches the barriers that separate immune cells from sperm and many men develop anti-sperm antibodies after undergoing the procedure. this has given rise to concern on the part of doctors and researchers because immune reactions against parts of one's own body sometimes cause disease. rheumatoid arthritis juvenile diabetes and multiple sclerosis are just some of the illnesses suspected or known to be caused by immune reactions of this type. immune reactions can also contribute to the development of atherosclerosis the clogging of arteries that leads to heart attacks. in the late  after a study of  monkeys showed an increased risk of atherosclerosis in vasectomized animals doctors became concerned that vasectomy might increase the risk of heart disease in men. other more persuasive research results however indicated that these concerns were not warranted. in particular one study found no evidence that vasectomized men were more likely than others to develop heart disease or any other immune illnesses.
generics are proved by the fda when they come to market. they do contain the same active ingredient as the brand they may differ though in the way that their tablets are made. they may have a different sugar or a different salt or a different color. now there are some classes of medications though where the brands maybe better for a patient such as thyroid medication there are blood thinners. we need to find that out based on patient by patient so individual decisions. but overall generics can be a great way for patients to save a little money and get the medication that they need.
yes. if the urine dipstick test is positive for nitrites leukocytes and blood there is a very good chance that you have a uti. the urine culture will likely determine the organism that is causing it and the extent of the infection.

i am not sure what you have but i believe it is called contact dermatitis. i am not sure what this is since i have not seen it. but i have had small itchy red spot on my skin around my face on my cheek. and even though i did not feel a doctor was right for me cause i knew what i should do. i am always putting my hands to my face and i always seem to wash my hands but maybe not good enough and may have transfer some germs to my face. cause no one touches my face but me. so i got out my hydrogen peroxide and i put some on a gauze pad and clean the area with it. it did turn white which that is what it is suppose to do. within a day or two it cleared up. no more redness or itching but the dry skin needed a moisturizer so i got one at my local pharmacy. if you have rashes a lot then you may need to keep something on hand for things like this. ask your pharmacy that you trust about this and see what he recommends but if you like you can always go to your doctor to find out what he recommends also. i hope you will keep in touch with us and do let us know how you are doing. maybe you can help us by helping other people. i also need to say the hydrogen peroxide is harmless if you put it on the right thing. mainly a sore or dry itchy spot. the reason that it turns white is that it is telling you that it is getting rid of the bacteria that is on the spot. it is also good for getting blood out of t shirts. cause it is not a bleach. but you still don't won't to drink it though but it will take the blood out of anything clothes shoes purses etc but you will need to do that asap. put anything with blood on it in cold water then put the peroxide in it. and i know it works cause it has happen to me. i thought i would throw that in. but i keep hydrogen peroxide at my home cause i am always needing it. if you want to find whether or not something is infected use a little of peroxide and if it turns white then you have bacteria. i use it also on my hands one day my hands were itching so bad and i knew that something was up so i said i know what i have so i used the peroxide and wash my hands in it and within the hour i had no more itchy hands. and my hands turned white. so please let us know what decision you made and let us know how you are doing. thank you
protein is the building block for muscle growth. you need to be getting enough in your diet to build muscle and if you do not supplementing with a shake is a great idea. i prefer whey protein but i have no science to support this. it is also scientifically proven that taking in protein and carbs in a : ratio pro:carb in the immediate post workout time period is important to maximize the benefits of your workouts.
no drinking lemon juice will not prevent a stomach virus. the citric acid on lemons can damage teeth if you eat them excessively but in moderation. you are not likely to have a problem. lemons are high in vitamin c but many scientific studies have not proven that vitamin c prevents colds or viral infections. i am not a doctor however i would like to share my experience with lemon juice and stomach bugs. i have been using lemon juice to prevent the stomach bug for several years now. we have never caught the stomach bug while using fresh squeezed lemon juice. i will share our regimen; once exposed we drink an ounce of fresh lemon juice twice a day for ten days. we make it into lemonade for our kids. one of my daughters decided she didn't want lemon juice on day  and by that evening she was sick. the rest of us started over again and drank lemonade for another  days and we were fine. since this one incident my kids never ever stop drinking their lemonade in fact they remind me to get it for them. it has been  percent effective for us! yes it does. new research in  have found that the citric acid molecule found in lemons binds to the norovirus capsid particle and prevent the virus to bind on other cells. sources: - <link> - <link> you can relax now <positive_smiley>

it's never a good idea to stack your packs! i would try a different brand of birth control pills something with higher hormones in them. another idea is to try a different form of birth control such as the patch iud depo shot. i personally didn't like the depo shot because i had alot of break through bleeding and more pregnancy symptoms then when i was actually pregnant with my sons. your period is a natural thing that shouldn't be avoided. it can be very unhealthy.
it's actually not me. i have no doubt of the actual intercourse taking place just suspicious if it's his. it seems to early to tell at  weeks. i thought the urine tests had to be at least  weeks. it happened once and he's been on prednisone for a long time and  other gout medications that i was under the impression could lower sperm count. also she may or may not have been seeing someone else just before. just all seems to convenient and quick.
"ortho tri-cyclen lo contains a low amount of estrogen. sometimes your own hormones can rule over the pill form that you are taking. other factors can also throw off your cycle like stress. sometimes womens hormones can also ""talk"" to each other causing women in the same vicinity to become regulated to the same cycle. if you have just started a new job or school where you are hanging out with other women every day your cycles can become synced with theirs. before you start a new pill pack you may want to take an at-home pregnancy test. keep an eye on your cycles and if they are continually irregular you may need a different type of birth control."
i don't know why
this is a great question. every summer i get asked about poison ivy and poison oak because everyone goes outside. a lot of gardeners end up with it. and people don't realize that pets can actually carry the oils from poison ivy and poison oak in their fur. so when you pat your dog that has been outside the oils may transfer. the first thing you want to do is apply a cool compress to the affected area. you don't want to scratch it because the bacteria in your fingernails can get into your skin and cause an infection. you also want to try drying up the oils as quickly as possible. there are products on the market like ivy dry tecnu and zanfel which are actually soaps that bind to those oils so you can wash them away. this can help promote healing and dry the affected area. if you notice that the area is starting to get red you are running a fever it's spreading or if the rash appears on your face and your eyes you want to go to a doctor right away. you will probably need prescription medication to help slow down the reaction. you can avoid making contact with poison oak and poison ivy by using products like ivy dry tecnu and zanfel before you go out. they can protect you from getting the oils on your skin and ending up with a reaction.
antibiotics are very hard on your stomach if taken without food.

if you are consistently taking in more calories than your body requires then you may expect to gain weight over time regardless of whether its calories from protein fat or carbohydrates. some research suggests however that a slightly higher protein diet can actually help you lose weight perhaps by helping you to feel satiated (feel full) to ultimately take in fewer calories. you won't gain weight as the protein ingested will store itself in your body for later use if you go above the amount your body can digest at once but don't expect to see gains in muscle. as long as you keep those saturated and trans fats out of your diet most people will keep a steady weight.

warts are usually diagnosed based only on their appearance. in rare cases more testing is done. if the diagnosis of a skin condition is unclear or if you are at high risk of having skin cancer your doctor may take a sample of the growth and examine it (a skin biopsy ). a biopsy is usually done if a skin growth is darker than the skin surrounding it appears as an irregular patch on the skin bleeds or is large and growing rapidly. proper diagnosis of plantar warts is important. some wart treatments can cause scarring. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

hi. it is a good sign that x ray and mri scan is normal. you need not to worry but consult an orthopedician once and get evaluated so that he can evaluate the x rays and mri once again. you can also be advised to get checked for complete blood count and uric acid levels along with nerve related studies for further confirmation. if nothing specific is ruled out then pain relievers muscle relaxants and physiotherapy can help. regards.

"when it comes to carbs we generally divide them into two groups: refined and unrefined. some people refer to these as ""bad carbs"" and ""good carbs "" respectively. in general refined carbohydrates are less valuable nutritionally than unrefined (whole) carbs. so a list of unrefined (whole) carbohydrates might include: all raw frozen or canned vegetables (though canned vegetables can contain excessive salt) all raw or frozen fruit (without added sugar) all whole grains (brown rice whole wheat pasta) all whole or canned beans be careful with potatoes. white (and red-skinned golden etc. ) potatoes can cause blood sugar to spike after eating. also be careful with so-called ""whole grain"" breads. read bread labels carefully or buy from a bakery that grinds its own grain. a simple way to evaluate bread is by its mass (weightiness) in your hand. if a bread feels heavy and dense it's probably a good whole-grain loaf. when it comes to fruits some contain more natural sugars than others. grapes are very sugary and shouldn't be a first choice for people with diabetes for example. canned fruits often contain a lot of added sugar so again read labels carefully. of course remember sugar of any kind is a carbohydrate. refined sugars including granulated (white or brown) sugar and powdered sugar is not good in excess. watch for hidden sugars in prepared foods and beverages. good for you for trying to improve your diet. eating a variety of fresh vegetables fruits and whole grains is good for your health. wishing you well! the mayo clinic website has great info and detailed food lists for diabetics etc. should be able to find what you want there also. elizabeth has given you good info. i'm a type  diabetic and can validate what she advises. the more ""processed"" a food item is. the worse it is for us. read the label. those ""whole grain breads"" use processed wheat (white) flour as a base with enough whole wheat flour and often molasses for coloring. luckily i was raised by my grandparents in the late 's and 's on a farm and learned how to eat and cook from the basics. you should learn that if you want to survive diabetes. old-fashioned rolled oats will become your best friend during a sweet attack. i've found that homemade white cornbread is relatively non-offensive (believe-it-or-not). and don't waste your money on sucralose. it doesn't sweeten diddly when cooking plain old walmart aspartame works just fine. good luck"
the reason why a prescription maybe dosed  hours is that's what was done in the studies and that's how we know the drug works and how it's going to be effective. so if you extend that timeframe the drug may not work as well you may not feel better because the drug needs that constant blood level in your system. so in the beginning once every  hours you are taking it faithfully it creates what we call steady levels. if you tend to forget a dose or take it a lot later you might actually break up that steady dose of the medication. and therefore that could lead to an increase in side-effects or do not help in infection or blood pressure or something else. so you really want to adhere to the dosing schedule that's on that particular prescription bottle. if you have any questions ask your pharmacist.

congratulations! it sounds like you are doing an excellent job with your lifestyle changes. diet and exercise are the cornerstones of treating both heart disease and diabetes. but at the same time there are many studies that show that taking statins after a heart attack can actually help prevent future heart attacks as well. a major study called the care trial showed that people who were on statins for at least  years after a heart attack were less likely to need further procedures such as bypass surgery or stents. they were also less likely to die from heart disease. statins can help keep plaque from building up in the arteries including those around the heart. in some cases they can actually cause a regression of the plaque. a statin may also help stabilize this plaque so that it is less likely to break and cause a blood clot. a blood clot in an artery on the heart wall is what causes most heart attacks. it is very important that you work closely with your doctor. your lipid levels and other risk factors should continue to be carefully monitored. talk to your doctor about any concerns you have about your medications. working together you will be able to come up with a long term treatment plan that is right for you. keep up the great work!
"boy do i hear you -- because i have the same thing! some people simply have a chronically runny nose. usually the fluid is clear and thin. this condition is called "" non-allergic rhinitis. "" this means your runny nose isn't related to any allergic cause. if eating spicy or hot foods makes this problem worse the medical term for it is ""gustatory rhinitis"" or ""gustatory rhinorrhea. "" either way there's no cure. there's no cure for non-allergic rhinitis either. if you've tried over-the-counter pills and prescription nasal sprays without relief i'm not sure what to suggest. more hankies? sorry i can't be of more help but at least take comfort in knowing you're not alone: about  million americans suffer from non-allergic rhinitis. take care! it could be seasonal allergy rhinitis. it occurs at the time of season changes and people easily get such symptoms. so you need to treat it by having medicines like allegra. such seasonal allergies are caused due to dust and pollen etc. so to treat it you may opt for allegra which is effective non-sedating antihistamine medicine that is intended to be used to treat for relieving allergy symptoms such as hay fever itchy eyes runny nose and others. allegra is easily available on online drug pharmacy drugpillstore."
the amount of bone loss that is % is not alarming at  years of age. it is routinely seen in patients at this age. there is no need to worry as it does not mean that the tooth will fall off soon. try to maintain the current level by using a warm salt water gargle twice a day or as much as possible or even a mouthwash solution will help. go for routine checkup once in every six months and get your teeth cleaned to maintain good oral hygiene. the x-ray would have been more helpful for me to give a better diagnosis. kindly watch out for loose teeth and show to your dentist. for further information consult a periodontist online --><link>
there is really little that i can do blindly over the internet since i have no way of examining your skin eruption. a visual exam is essential to make an accurate diagnosis. failure to improve on your current treatment may indicated that the diagnosis was incorrect or the treatment was not appropriate. your only course of action is to be examined again or see a dermatologist for a higher-level diagnostic opinion.

"xanax is a benzodiazepine & works by slowing down the movement of chemicals in the brain that may become unbalanced thus resulting in a reduction in nervous tension. it is usually used to treat anxiety & panic disorders and anxiety caused by depression. prozac is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor ""ssri"" & is used more for depression. however it is also used to treat anxiety panic & ocd disorders. they have been known to be used together as well as individually. they also are used in conjunction with other types of medications to try to achieve relief. i've also heard that xanax should not be used for long-term as with most ""benzos"" for fear of dependency. a few good links to look up meds. are: <link> <link> <link> these are the ones i trust the most as i take a boat-load of scripts & when i am prescribed a new one. i look up to see if there may be any interactions with the ones i'm currently taking. hope this helps!"
i have known people that have used home pregnancy tests that came up negative and went to the doctor and it was positive.
"the research is mixed on the effect of exercise on cholesterol. some studies show that exercise helps lower it while others do not. when exercise does lower cholesterol the effect may be what researchers consider statistically significant but clinically it may drop only a few percentage points and not enough to lower cholesterol into a healthy range. you might consider making a deal with your doctor where you agree to try three months of regular exercise and attention to your diet to lower your cholesterol and if the change at three months isn't enough to put the value in a healthy range then you can discuss how to proceed with your physician. you should know that the side effects of statins are easy to monitor not everyone gets side effects and they are effective medications. as for the type of exercise to lower cholesterol most of the research involves aerobic exercise so walking jogging biking swimming dancing and all cardio machines at the gym count. how much aerobic exercise you need to do or how hard it should be is unknown but aim for five or more days per week for at least  minutes at an intensity of approximately % to % of your maximum heart rate. consistency is important if you try the three-month experiment so plan carefully. set a weekly exercise plan at the beginning of each week and make the plan as realistic and specific as possible. write down the days of the week the time of day the type of exercise and the duration. again be as specific and realistic as possible to increase the probability of doing it. if and when you miss a day get right back on track and always set your weekly plan at the beginning of every week. the good news is that even if your cholesterol doesn't come down with three months of regular exercise you'll certainly get more fit and research shows that other lipid risk factors for heart disease improve with regular exercise. for instance triglycerides almost always drop with regular aerobic exercise sometimes as much as  mg/dl and hdl cholesterol the ""good"" cholesterol rises in some people when they exercise regularly (hdl cholesterol carries ""bad"" cholesterol away from arteries and to the liver where it's removed from the body). good luck with the three-month experiment if you decide to try it. but even if you don't get the results you want and end up needing a statin there are so many other benefits of regular exercise that it's certainly worth the effort."
have you done anything to recolonized your intestines with good bacteria after killing all the old ones off? i'd try some greek yogurt also kefir sauerkraut and other probiotic foods. commercial probiotics help too but make sure you pick one with a wide range of helpful bacteria. also make sure you are drinking enough water. dark urine could mean kidney problems simple dehydration or malabsorption of nutrients from improper digestion of your food. if that doesn't help within a week or if you already have tried probiotic therapy this needs help from a doctor.
that is a low blood sugar reading. the american diabetes association recommends -/dl for most nonpregnant adults with diabetes. before meals it's -/dl and /dl or less after meals. more or less blood sugar levels may be recommended based on individual circumstances. if your grandmother continues to experience low blood sugars she should see her healthcare provider. she may need changes in the medications she is taking. for more on managing blood sugars see this webmd article.
"cosmetics: don't be afraid to hide blemishes with flesh-tinted coverups or even foundation as long at it is water-based (which makes it noncomedogenic). there are many quality products available. facials: while not absolutely essential steaming and ""deep-cleaning"" pores is useful both alone and in addition to medical treatment especially for people with ""whiteheads"" or ""blackheads. "" having these pores unclogged by a professional also reduces the temptation to do it yourself. pore strips: pharmacies now carry under a variety of brand names strips which you put on your nose forehead chin etc. to ""pull out"" oil from your pores. these are in effect a do-it-yourself facial. they are inexpensive safe and work reasonably well if used properly. toothpaste? one popular home remedy is to put toothpaste on zits. there is no medical basis for this. ditto for vinegar."

the best way to reduce weight is by regular physical exercise and balanced diet. you can lose weight by reducing your intake of oily food and sweets. it is also important to space your meals in such a way that you have more frequent small meals (and not heavy meals). regular physical exercise in the form of some cardio and strength training will make you fit and strong. sleep and hydration are equally important when you try to lose weight. ensure that you take lots of fluids and that you get at least - hours of sleep per day. medicine to lose weight: as a doctor i never really recommend my patients to take medicines to lose weight. only one drug is approved for use in india- orlistat. if you really want to take it you can take tablet orlistat  thrice a day (after your  major meals). as i have seen in practice and also research results say that orlistat does not produce too much change in weight. it shows just a small percentage of weight loss when coupled with low-calorie diet and exercise. and orlistat has its own share of side effects: fatty/oily stool oily spotting intestinal gas with discharge a feeling of needing to have a bowel movement right away increased number of bowel movements or poor bowel control. rare but serious side effects can occur: symptoms of liver disease (such as persistent nausea/vomiting severe stomach/abdominal pain dark urine yellowing eyes/skin) symptoms of kidney stones (such as back pain pain while urinating pink/bloody urine). bottom line: i do not recommend medicines for weight loss. i can make a good diet chart and exercise regimen for you if you would like to follow up in which case you will have to get back to me with your details- your daily food routine your work timings your daily sleep cycle the kind of exercises you prefer etc. i hope that answers your question. revert back to a fitness expert online --> <link>
getting rid of bed bugs is not an easy process and most cases of bed bug infestation will require treatment by a pest-control expert. a variety of low-odor sprays dusts and aerosol insecticides can be used to eradicate bed bugs. these must be applied to all areas where the bugs are observed as well as spaces where they may crawl or hide. the pest-control company can help you determine if the mattress can be disinfected or must be discarded. since beds cannot readily be treated with insecticides it's often necessary to discard infested mattresses and beds. the pest-control expert may recommend certain forms of deep-cleaning such as scrubbing infested surfaces with a stiff brush to remove eggs dismantling bed frames and furniture filling cracks in floors walls and moldings encasing mattresses within special bags or using a powerful vacuum on cracks and crevices.
"the general rule of thumb is that you should not take products like tylenol pm for more than  days. if you have been taking this for more than that i would advise making an appointment with your doctor or healthcare provider for further evaluation. with continued use you may experience ""rebound insomnia"" which means you get a version of insomnia that can be much worse or you could even develop a tolerance to tylenol pm (which means no matter how much you take it will not work). another important issue is that you may be experiencing side effects like dry mouth dizziness and constipation which could lead you to using additional medications to treat those side effects -- which would not be necessary if you were not taking the tylenol pm."
"people who are not eating right and exercising are more susceptible to head colds and those bouts last longer and are more likely to result in complications such as pneumonia or bronchitis or sinusitis etc. compared to people who eat right and exercise regularly. this general principle is especially true for people with diabetes (type  or ) because their bodies respond particularly well to lifestyle efforts and they are particularly ""penalized"" when unable to eat right or exercise. diabetes is very unforgiving this way. the immune cells (white blood cells) are particularly sensitive to improvements (or worsening) of blood sugar control. they are among the first bodily functions to improve when the glucose control does. this probably translates into rapid reduction in risk for colds and other infections in someone who finds a way to make lifestyle changes. i believe you would not be surprised to hear an answer like this one and i know you would like to make such changes. we all recognize it is hard to do and takes advanced planning and an organized approach."

if its mild you should treat a pulled calf muscle by resting it and protecting it from re-injury. painful calf muscle strains deserve price therapy (see below) and complete calf muscle tears (which are rare) may need surgical repair. the vast majority of pulled calf muscles will heal completely within a few weeks without any treatment. pulled muscles are also called muscle strains. they occur when muscle fibers are stretched beyond their normal length. the injury creates tears in the muscle that are usually tiny (microtears). in the most severe calf muscle strains the entire muscle is torn causing significant swelling and pain. the calf muscle (also called the gastrocnemius) is a commonly injured muscle. a pulled calf muscle most often occurs after vigorous activity (running jumping climbing stairs) but can happen with normal activity in middle-aged and elderly people. pain possibly with some swelling or bruising is the main symptom of a calf muscle strain. immediately after a pulled calf muscle using price therapy may help speed healing: p for protect from re-injury r for rest i for immobilize with tape or an athletic bandage wrap c for compression (make that wrap tight but not so tight your leg goes numb) e for elevate (keeping your calf muscle above your heart may reduce swelling) price actually stands for prevention rest ice compression evaluate elevate*** i had the same thing happen to me. you need to go to a sports medicine doctor and get an x-ray of you ankle. it might sound crazy but there is a possibility that you broke your tibia in your ankle. when you break your tibia your calf hurts then your ankle starts to hurt. i had this happen and i went to my physician and they said it was a mild sprang so i walked around for a month with a broken ankle and i just found out three weeks ago and i am still in a cast.

most birth control pills contain a combination of two types of hormones: an estrogen and a progestin. these work together to stop your body's production of a hormone that tells your ovaries to release an egg. so in fact they primarily work by stopping ovulation from occurring each cycle. if there is no egg released there is no egg to fertilize and you prevent pregnancy. the hormones in the birth control pills cause other changes that help to prevent pregnancy as well. nevertheless this is their main mechanism of action.

left untreated depression can have far reaching effects on both your and your babys health. women who are depressed are less likely to take proper care of themselves. for instance they may not eat a healthy diet or may skip doctors appointments. plus women who are depressed may be more likely to take part in risky behaviors such as drinking alcohol smoking or taking drugs during pregnancy. all of these actions can lead to potentially serious health problems for the baby including miscarriage preterm birth and low birth weight. untreated depression can also take a toll on family dynamics. that includes your relationship with your spouse and other children. if you have older kids they need you to care for them. for some pregnant women regardless of their mental state it can take all the energy they have to care for themselves. add depression to the mix and the suffering can become intolerable for everyone. if depression is preventing you from caring for your family you may need to stay on your antidepressants during this vulnerable time. its important to keep the risks associated with antidepressant use in pregnancy in perspective. all pregnant women have an average % risk of having a baby with any type of birth defect in most cases. when researchers say antidepressants may increase the risk of certain birth defects they are talking about just a slight increase. so even if you take an antidepressant during pregnancy the overall risk of your baby having a problem is still very low.
the cause of low blood pressure isn't always clear. it may be associated with the following: pregnancy hormonal problems such as an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) diabetes or low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) some over-the-counter medications some prescription medicines such as for high blood pressure depression or parkinsons disease heart failure heart arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms) widening or dilation of the blood vessels heat exhaustion or heat stroke liver disease sudden drops in blood pressure can be life-threatening. causes of this type of hypotension include: loss of blood from bleeding low body temperature high body temperature heart muscle disease causing heart failure sepsis a severe blood infection severe dehydration from vomiting diarrhea or fever a reaction to medication or alcohol a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis postural hypotension which is low blood pressure when standing up suddenly can happen to anyone for a variety of reasons such as dehydration lack of food or being overly fatigued. it can also be influenced by genetic make-up aging medication dietary and psychological factors and acute triggers such as infection and allergy. postural hypotension occurs most frequently in people who are taking drugs to control high blood pressure (hypertension). it can also be related to pregnancy strong emotions hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) or diabetes. the elderly are particularly affected especially those who have high blood pressure or autonomic nervous system dysfunction. hypotension after meals is a common cause of dizziness and falls after eating. this is most common after large meals containing a lot of carbohydrates. its believed to be caused by blood pooling into the vessels of the stomach and intestines. several drugs are commonly associated with postural hypotension. these medications can be divided into two major categories: drugs used to treat high blood pressure such as diuretics beta-blockers calcium-channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors drugs that have hypotension as a side effect including nitrates drugs for parkinson's disease antipsychotics neuroleptics anti-anxiety agents sedative-hypnotics and tricyclic antidepressants common causes of naturally occurring postural hypotension include: dehydration and electrolyte loss which may result from diarrhea vomiting excessive blood loss during menstruation or other conditions age-associated decline in blood pressure regulation which may be worsened by certain health conditions or medications certain diseases can also cause postural hypotension. these include: central nervous system disorders such as shy-drager syndrome or multiple system atrophy nerve problems such as peripheral neuropathy or autonomic neuropathy cardiovascular disorders alcoholism nutritional diseases

"your birth control pills will also prevent pregnancy something that i think you are definitely going to need if you continue with this risky sex-play it is only a matter of time before you both decide to ""go for it"" so why not carefully plan for the inevitable? spotting or a milky discharge can be many things from a minor vaginal injury (from that rubbing) and your own vaginal mucous. it could be a yeast infection if you are also having itching or irritation. see your medical provider if you are concerned. ejaculation on or near the vaginal opening is a bit risky. while it is not very likely you got pregnant this time since you are on the pill and the ejaculation was not vaginal you want to really avoid as much live viable sperm as you can. you really can't trust your partner during these heated moments of passion so must make him use a condom even if you have not consented to going ""all the way"". this will contain his semen. if you have a normal period and no signs of pregnancy you won. this time but please keep in mind that thiings could change. be prepared and be pro-active."
panic attacks are not just an emotional response. if you have ever felt your heart beating very hard it means you have high blood pressure. i know that when i get panic attacks i can't breathe properly and/or i get squeezing headaches. and if you have too much of a food or a certain drink that can also trigger a panic attack. but the best way that i know to stop a panic attack is to either hold your breath for  seconds or to just relax yourself and breathe slowly or drink a certain amount of water. best of luck!
"arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart muscles are called coronary arteries. coronary artery disease (cad) occurs when cholesterol plaque (a hard thick substance comprised of varying amounts of cholesterol calcium muscle cells and connective tissue which accumulates locally in the artery walls) builds up in the walls of these arteries a process called arteriosclerosis. over time arteriosclerosis causes significant narrowing of one or more coronary arteries. when coronary arteries narrow more than  to % the blood supply beyond the plaque becomes inadequate to meet the increased oxygen demand during exercise. lack of oxygen (ischemia) in the heart muscle causes chest pain (angina) in most patients. however some % of patients experience no chest pain at all despite documented ischemia or may only develop episodic shortness of breath instead of chest pain. these patients have ""silent angina"" and have the same risk of heart attack as those with angina. when arteries are narrowed in excess of -% patients often have angina at rest (unstable angina). when a blood clot (thrombus) forms on the plaque the artery may become completely blocked causing death of a part of the heart muscle (heart attack or myocardial infarction ). the arteriosclerotic process can be accelerated by smoking high blood pressure elevated cholesterol levels and diabetes. patients are also at higher risk for arteriosclerosis if they are older (greater than  years for men and  years for women) or if they have a family history of coronary heart disease."

not a good idea. too much nicotine.
this is definitely a reaction to the flu shot. the recovery period though depends on your overall health. it may vary anywhere from  weeks to around  days. you should take anti allergic tablets and vitamin supplements to alleviate the symptoms
so one of the things that i have people have problems with is what i call the on-call response. and so this is just like a physician who is waiting for that phone call all night long they are waking up all night because they know theyve got an early morning and they want to make sure that they dont miss their alarm. the easiest thing that people can do to try and thwart the on-call effect is basically to set your alarm have somebody else outside of either your home or somebody within your home to make sure that they will get you up at such-and-such at time. you can even have a wake up service if youre staying at a hotel and there are actually wakeup services that you can have call to your home again to make sure that youre getting up at the right specified time. remember meditation and relaxation before sleep will help with that. and if you wake up in the middle of the night dont go for the alarm time to look and see what time it is. make sure you cant see the alarm clock. spin it around. it will work. its not going to break in the middle of the night. if you have to set two alarm clocks one on your cell phone one on your regular alarm and get yourself some sleep.
hi blood in stools or urine go see your doctor asap. good luck
hi have a good read of this link it could help understand your problems. the link <link> /f/cigarette_smoking_and_sleep. htm just copy this link into google to open and read but the real answer would be to pack up the smokes hard but can be done how do i know i did  years ago smoked from the age of . so yes it can be done. good luck
no. as early as your mid 's you can have pre-menopause symptoms which can be similar to pregnancy. like the previous person said the only way to conceive would be ivf. if your symptoms continue check with your doctor they may need to check your hormone levels and examine you to rule out cysts etc. cysts on the uterus can cause pregnancy symptoms and are usually treatable with medication.
hi do you have any curve on that side and not knowing you age does not help could be the start of pyronie's disease this could be the pain. but as for the swelling well for some of us its called an erection so from that how bad is this swelling? and is the swelling painful or something that just happens?
we planned it like that but i have been discharging all day and then now i am lightly bleeding so i am just wondering if i could be and im not freaking out. i want to get pregnant.
hi so you had an maxofacal but for what as you have not been smoking for that long perhaps now would be a good time to say no more. just think about it. good luck ps if you want to reply just use answer this above.
hi as nordette ecp has a range of  hours i think you should be on the safe side of not being pregnant. so in the next two days you should start a period and this will be from when your periods will now start this is what it does. ok good luck
if there were enlarged lymph nodes and all others resolved and just one is left then it can be most probably due to infection. take him to the physician again and get evaluated. if needed another course of antibiotics will be advised and a biopsy will be done for confirmation. hope he gets well soon. regards.
to my knowledge no one has invented an internal blood pressure monitor nor do i think there would be a use for something this invasive. do you want to invent one? there are plenty of telemetry devices that will take your blood pressure automatically at prescheduled times. this is commonly done in hospitals like intensive care units. to put an internal device inside you like a pacemaker or defibrillator would seem to be more risky than just taking the blood pressure when you need it.
swelling or an internal bruise may be the cause for your pain and discomfort. may i ask. have you missed your period lately?
most helpful answer it should not close in an hour but it may be a bit challenging for you to re-insert the earring again. even an hour later. keep your hands very clean clean the piercing and observe closely for infection. cartilage piercings are notorious for getting infected.

firstly congrats on being independent and living on your own. its a big step but a great one. and at times yes you may feel down or irritated but this can all be helped! your anxiety can also be controlled and personally i think you should be doing this through eating the right foods including lots of raw fruit and vegetables dairy free milk such as oat milk soy milk almond milk or if you do not like that at least low or no fat milk. cut out on all processed foods that contain presertitives flavours or flavor enhancers artificial colors added sugar and high salts. this all has effects on the body and is un-natural. just changing what you eat will help your thought processes. decent exercise is also a great way to relieve anxiety and depression. doing good will make you feel good! and lots of good un-interupted sleep is very important too. at least - hours. i dont think the zoloft is doing you any good. these are synthetic chemicals that do more damage to your head and body in the long run. join a yoga class or do some volunteer work. getting out and meeting people will make you feel good. try to learn something new everyday and keep your mind active. don't let bad thoughts get in the way of enjoying this precious life you have. hope this helps you in some way <positive_smiley> keep positive!
home treatment measures may help you control the symptoms of mild gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd). these include making lifestyle changes and taking nonprescription medicines that reduce or block acid. these include antacids (for example tums)  blockers (for example pepcid ) and proton pump inhibitors (for example prilosec otc). if you have been using nonprescription medicines to treat your symptoms for longer than  weeks talk to your doctor. if you have gerd the stomach acid could be causing damage to your esophagus. your doctor can help you find the right treatment. you can make changes to your lifestyle to help relieve your symptoms of gerd. here are some things to try: change your eating habits. its best to eat several small meals instead of two or three large meals. after you eat wait  to  hours before you lie down. late-night snacks aren't a good idea. chocolate mint and alcohol can make gerd worse. they relax the valve between the esophagus and the stomach. spicy foods foods that have a lot of acid (like tomatoes and oranges) and coffee can make gerd symptoms worse in some people. if your symptoms are worse after you eat a certain food you may want to stop eating that food to see if your symptoms get better. do not smoke or chew tobacco. if you have gerd symptoms at night raise the head of your bed to by putting the frame on blocks or placing a foam wedge under the head of your mattress. (adding extra pillows does not work. ) avoid or reduce pressure on your stomach. do not wear tight clothing around your middle. lose weight if you need to. losing just  to  pounds can help. gerd: controlling heartburn by changing your habits along with lifestyle changes nonprescription medicines may be needed to control occasional heartburn. medicines used for home treatment of gerd include antacids (for example tums)  blockers (for example pepcid) and proton pump inhibitors (for example prilosec otc). if you have been using nonprescription medicines to treat your symptoms for longer than  weeks talk to your doctor. if you have gerd the stomach acid could be causing damage to your esophagus. your doctor can help you find the right treatment. for more information about prescription forms of these drugs see the medications section of this topic. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.
the most important part of any pulmonary rehabilitation program for copd is exercise. all pulmonary rehab centers offer exercises to improve physical fitness. some pulmonary rehab centers provide an exercise program only. other centers provide access to specialists education and psychological support in addition to exercises. pulmonary rehab exercises include: lower-body exercises: most pulmonary rehab centers provide a regimen of exercises that centers on leg workouts. these exercises vary from simple walking on a treadmill or around a track to more intense stair climbing. most of the proven benefits of pulmonary rehab come from studies in people doing leg exercises. upper-body exercises: the muscles in the upper body are important for breathing as well as daily activities. arm and chest exercises might include turning a crank against resistance or simply repetitively lifting the arms against gravity. exercises for breathing muscles: breathing through a mouthpiece against resistance during pulmonary rehab may increase the strength of the breathing muscles. these exercises are infrequently used but may be helpful for people with very weak breathing muscles. strength training : most pulmonary rehab exercises concentrate on building endurance. adding strength training like lifting weights has been shown to increase muscle strength and bulk as well.
benadryl is very effective for hives because of the fast onset of the medication but only lasts about four hours. zyrtec tends to be slower in onset but lasts longer ( hours). both are antihistamines of course and most of the time you only need one of the other. on some occasions however when you have taken zyrtec in the  hours you can still get hives so it is safe to take a dose of benadryl. benadryl does cause sedation so please be careful if you need to drive.
there are no medical ways to increase your height after you have naturally stopped growing. you would be wasting your money on this medication. it will not increase your height unless of course you get two bottle and stand on top of them. you can wear lifts in your shoes if you want but my suggestion is to just stand tall and be proud. the measure of a person is not in their height but in their soul.

unfortunately people with low incomes living in states that chose not to expand their medicaid programs are often left without good coverage options just as they were before the affordable care act became law. you might look for medical care at federally qualified community health centers where you can receive good primary care on a sliding scale or at no cost. to find one near you check: <link> unfortunately people with low incomes living in states that chose not to expand their medicaid programs are often left without good coverage options just as they were before the affordable care act became law. you might look for medical care at federally qualified community health centers where you can receive good primary care on a sliding scale or at no cost. to find one near you check: <link> but you should also check with your state's medicaid department. if you are disabled you may qualify for coverage because of that.
most helpful answer you may have a few days of mouth discomfort but your dentist will provide you with some pain medication. you may need to alter your diet a bit (assuming you are hungry) but as far as complications are concerned this would be unlikely. assuming you are healthy. one thing of concern especially the lower extraction sites would be acquiring a dry socket. this is when the blood clot (part of the healing process) can become dislodged. can be caused by sucking liquids through a straw smoking. can be very painful but can be remedied by going back to dentist or oral surgeon and having what is called gel-foam usually coated with a substance called eugenol placed in socket. this usually takes care of pain and promotes healing.
about % of the children who are vaccinated develop a very mild case of chickenpox usually with no more than five to six blisters. it is also possible for a person who has been vaccinated for chickenpox to develop chickenpox at some later point in life. when that happens the disease is almost always milder and the recovery more rapid than for people who have not had the shots. it's important to keep in mind that up to % of the people who get the vaccine will not catch chickenpox

zyrtec lasts  hours so usually benadryl is not needed. it is safe to give it at night (even if he is on zyrtec) but this first-generation antihistamine can interfer with restful dream-state sleeping.
just about all one month olds have fussy periods so don't read too much in to it. thrush is not that painful. as long as she is nursing or taking a bottle it should be fine. either amount is fine on the nystatin. i give my patients one ml on each side of their mouth about four times a day (the medication is very safe). it should not upset her tummy but she could have an upset tummy from a bit of colic. it is okay to give tylenol (at the proper dosage for her weight) if you think she needs it.

diagnosis of celiac disease should be firmly established before commencing treatment with a gluten-free diet for several reasons. the gluten-free diet is a lifelong and tedious commitment that should not be taken lightly. it is more costly than a normal diet and has significant social implications for dining out. patients with irritable bowel syndrome may experience improvements in bloating abdominal pain and diarrhea with a gluten-free diet. these patients may be misdiagnosed as having celiac disease. without confirmation of celiac disease by small intestinal biopsy they may be unnecessarily committed to lifelong gluten restriction. a gluten-free diet can lower blood antibody levels and allow the small intestine to lose the typical appearance of celiac disease complicating subsequent efforts at making a firm diagnosis of celiac disease.
it is not possible to make a blind diagnosis over the internet. in other words if i can't see it first-hand during and exam and actually feel it it would not be possible for me or any medical provider to offer you a definitive answer. you will need to see a medical professional or dermatologist. sorry.

"there can be many reasons but night terrors would be the most likely. he may be having vivid dreams so real to him that it can frighten him. he may not remember having these dreams but he will wake up (some times) and need comfort. some children can just cry or scream in their sleep without fully waking up. some will get out of bed and come to you. night terrors can last a while and their may be little that can be done to prevent all of these episodes assuming that the does not have any underlying medical reasons for these awakenings. read to him before he goes to bed. read a nice story; a fun story. get his little mind focused on bunnies not scary things. be careful what he sees on television including commercials for movies that can be frightening to him. try to explain dreams to him (it may be difficult at this age) but do what you can to encourage ""sweet dreams"". a night light may be helpful in his room soft music or white noise (waterfall sounds rain sounds babbling brooks) are also helpful. there are white noise machines that are relatively inexpensive. this may help him to rest better. before he goes to bed to quiet activities. don't chase him around the house and get him all excited. these things will pass in time with love and support. for more information and other suggestions on dealing with ""night terrors"" an internet search will be very fruitful."
your father should not be taking lovastatin and pravastatin. they are in the same class of medications and he should not need both of them. taking both can put him at risk for adverse effects like muscle pain and myopathy. all of his other medications look fine. but you should have him sit down and review all of his medications with his doctor and pharmacist to be sure he is using them appropriately. if you are worried about drug interactions it is important that you only use one pharmacy to fill all of your prescriptions so that the pharmacist can properly screen for interactions. and talk to your pharmacist. they can provide you all the information you need to use your medications safely.

lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus or sle) is a condition of chronic inflammation caused by an autoimmune disease. autoimmune diseases are illnesses that occur when the body's tissues are attacked by its own immune system. the precise reason for the abnormal autoimmunity that causes lupus is not known. inherited genes viruses ultraviolet light and drugs may all play some role. the genes some people inherit seem to increase the tendency of developing autoimmune diseases and autoimmune diseases such as lupus rheumatoid arthritis and immune thyroid disorders are more common among relatives of patients with lupus than the general population. some scientists believe that the immune system in lupus patients is more easily stimulated by external factors like viruses or ultraviolet light. sometimes symptoms of lupus can be precipitated or aggravated by only a brief period of sun exposure. research provides direct evidence that a key enzyme's failure to dispose of dying cells contributes to sle. accordingly a genetic mutation that disrupts the body's cellular waste disposal may be involved in the beginning of sle.

"the fda sets rules for what food manufacturers can call ""light "" ""low "" ""reduced "" ""free "" and other food terms. here's the low-down on these terms: ""healthy"" food must be low in fat with limited cholesterol and sodium. anything labeled ""free"" must only contain tiny amounts of the ingredient in each serving. for example ""trans-fat free"" or ""fat-free"" products can have only .  mg of trans fats or fat; ""cholesterol-free"" foods can only have two milligrams of cholesterol and two grams of saturated fat. a serving of food labeled ""low sodium"" can have a maximum of  milligrams of sodium. a serving of ""low cholesterol"" food can have a maximum of  milligrams of cholesterol and two grams of saturated fat. one serving of a ""low-fat"" food can have a maximum of three grams of fat. a serving of a ""low-calorie"" food can have a maximum of  calories. a serving of a food labeled ""reduced"" must have % less of the ingredient than a serving of the regular version. one serving of a ""light"" food must have % less fat or / fewer calories than the regular version. the food and drug administration (fda) regulates what claims a product can make. the following are a few examples to answer your question: - free. this term means that a product contains no amount of or only trivial or ""physiologically inconsequential"" amounts of one or more of these components: fat saturated fat cholesterol sodium sugars and calories. - low. this term can be used on foods that can be eaten frequently without exceeding dietary guidelines for one or more of these components: fat saturated fat cholesterol sodium and calories. - low-fat :  g or less per serving - low-saturated fat :  g or less per serving - low-sodium :  mg or less per serving - very low sodium :  mg or less per serving - low-calorie :  calories or less per serving. - low-cholesterol :  mg or less and  g or less of saturated fat per serving - reduced. this term means that a nutritionally altered product contains at least  percent less of a nutrient or of calories than the regular or reference product. however a reduced claim can't be made on a product if its reference food already meets the requirement for a ""low"" claim. - light. this descriptor can mean two things: - that a nutritionally altered product contains one-third fewer calories or half the fat of the reference food. - that the sodium content of a low-calorie low-fat food has been reduced by  percent."

it depends on where in your cycle you are and what antibiotic you are taking. not all antibiotics affect birth control pills. a general rule of thumb is to use an alternative method of birth control for the course of the antibiotic usage and for seven days after you stop. but it really would depend on your individual situation. you should talk to your gynecologist or pharmacist about what you should do.
"after gastric sleeve weight loss surgery it's very important to get enough protein to help with healing and recovery. this is something you should ask your doctor as everyone is different. in general most people need about  to  grams of protein a day. protein is important for long-term weight maintenance as well since it helps you feel full longer. due to malnutrition after weight loss surgery some people may also lose some hair. protein can help with that as well. but again you should ask your doctor how much is right for you and also to get suggestions on the type of protein since it's important to get ""complete proteins. "" that means all the amino acids that help make up protein in the body. meats are complete proteins but most non-meat proteins are not. but if you combine certain proteins such as rice and beans you can get all the amino acids in one meal."

if you're talking about your thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh) lab results i'm a bit surprised your doctor doesn't want to treat this. several years ago the american association of clinical endocrinologists (aace) announced it was revising the reference range for normal tsh values to .  to . . clearly your results (assuming you're referring to tsh) are outside that range. i'd suggest you gather your medical records and see another health care provider for a second opinion. if possible see an endocrinologist. these doctors specialize in disorders of the endocrine system including the thyroid. wishing you all the best!
this is one area that we just don't have enough data yet. ginger kind of falls in the category of being a vitamin and herbal supplement. it is regulated by the fda but not as strictly and therefore they really havent done a lot of clinical studies or types of studies where we are going to say okay you are on prescription drug x does this interact with it? so we really don't have that much data. there are some concerns about ginger causing an increase in bleeding. so you want to make sure that everyone knows that you are taking something like this. your pharmacist your doctor or whether healthcare provider make sure it's on a medication list which is all the medications that you are taking. so therefore if something does happen we are aware of it. but right now we just don't have enough data to find out whether or not that's going to happen.
in my opinion you have an allergic reaction i recommend that you wash it with alot of water then use corticosteroid creamsgood luck

hi after you stop taking birth control pills the exogenous hormones will leave your body within a few days regardless of how long you were taking the pill. however that does not mean youll see your period by the next cycle. some women may not get their period for several months; this condition is known as post-pill amenorrhea (absence of period). since the pill has been preventing your body from making ovulation and menstruation hormones it can alter the normal production and your body can take longer to resume production. while this may sound like a great side effect (no period for months on end! ) you should take a pregnancy test if youre sexually active since some women will ovulate and conceive before they ever have their first post-pill period. hope this helps you. good luck
"well let me start by noting that not all body shaking is caused by a seizure. seizures are caused by abnormal brain signals while other types of involuntary body movement such as tremors may be hereditary and of unknown origin. there also are different types of seizures. some of them involve mild to severe convulsions but some of them merely cause a person to sort of stare off into space for awhile as if they can't hear you. seizures rarely (dare i say ""never"") last up to  minutes. most seizures last just a few minutes maybe  to  minutes or so before they end. if you believe you've had a seizure you should see a doctor for further examination and assessment. it's important to do this because a seizure can be a symptom of another underlying health problem such as in infection. i hope this helps! it is because i am a survivor of one. i have epilepsy from several head injuries and in  minutes after surgery for a lumbar laminectomy i had a documented + minute seizure which ended with having a  day stay in icu along with scaring a surgeon and a anesthesiologist. even with all the precautions a  hour stay ended up with a  day camping trip at one of my least favorite places. luckily i don't remember anything except for the usual aura headaches and tiredness after each seizure. what saved my life was communication asking questions and family and doctor support. meds i take: keppra and depakote."
i suggest that you cleanse your face twice daily with soap and water. pack a pre-moistened cleansing pad if you won't be around a water basin throughout the day. shower or bathe in tepid water rather than steaming hot water. hot water can strip your skin of needed moisture while cold water can shock your skin. avoid using cleansers or toners that tend to over-dry skin or have high alcohol content. this over-drying actually causes your skin to produce even more oil than usual. use only noncomedogenic moisturizers and sunscreen products. this means they're oil-free and won't clog pores. use vitamin a derivatives or retinoids which reduce production in oil glands and shrink their size.
when your partner has multiple other partners. and is pregnant i would question her overall integrity. the only way that you will know if you or someone else is the father of this child is to have an official paternity test.
i would watch the bites because spider bites can cause serious skin infections which usually require antibiotics. check the area where you sleep vacuum the area and make sure you keep windows and doors closed to prevent the spiders from coming inside.
plans actually had to make decisions as to whether they would participate in the marketplace this spring and summer well before the website was launched. so although the website launch has been a fiasco it is not responsible for the number of plans participating. in general rural areas have a much smaller availability of health plans because it is harder for plans to contract with specific providers to form their network. so if you live in a rural area there are going to be fewer plans available than in an urban area regardless of the marketplace. plans may be hesitant to participate in states using the federal marketplace rather than states that chose to run their own. florida is not running its own marketplace.
follow a skin regimen that includes exfoliation (aha salicylic acid and papaya enzymes). hydrate your skin with natural oils that are non-comedogenic (non-pore-clogging) such as almond oil or avocado oil. rejuvenate your skin with natural skin peptides collagen builders and tretinoin.

osteoarthritis usually is treated by physical therapy with muscle-strengthening exercises oral medications hot and cold compresses to the painful joint removal of joint fluid injection of medications into the joint use of supportive devices such as crutches or canes and weight control. surgery may be helpful to relieve pain when other treatment options have not been effective. the type of treatment prescribed will depend on several factors including your age activities and occupation overall health medical history location of your osteoarthritis and severity of the condition. medications may be prescribed to reduce pain caused by osteoarthritis. pain-relieving medications include acetaminophen (for example tylenol) and anti-inflammatory drugs (often called nsaids) such as aspirin ibuprofen or celebrex. some medications in the form of creams rubs or sprays may be applied over the skin of affected areas to relieve pain. for some people with persistent pain despite these pills or creams steroids can be injected directly into the joint for pain relief. these injections are typically limited since prolonged use can lead to bone and cartilage deterioration and weakness. the antidepressant cymbalta (duloxetine) has been approved for osteoarthritis pain as well. it's a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor or snri that was first approved by the fda in . synvisc supartz euflexxa orthovisc and hyalgan are medications given as a series of three to five weekly joint injections that can relieve pain in some people with osteoarthritis. currently these drugs are only approved for knee osteoarthritis. when osteoarthritis pain is severe and other treatments are not working some doctors will give stronger pain pills such as narcotics. unfortunately none of these will reverse or slow the progression of joint damage caused by osteoarthritis.

hi  is the most spoke about day for ovulation and depending where you read on all lengths of cycles so if you work from day  you need to have unprotected sex around day  or  this gives sperm time to get in place which takes  days and then can live for  to  days also depending were you read take into account day  its give or take a day so perhaps if its a day or two after then his sperm is sitting there just waiting for action. but as long as your now pregnant unless you need to work out who the father is? can you work it out from what's above and you would need to know what days you had unprotected sex on these are the most important days any sex before day  is where you need to be looking. hope this helps you. good luck
medicine is used to treat some food allergies. medicines to treat a severe allergic reaction or an anaphylactic reaction are packaged in a prescribed allergy kit. for mild allergic reactions people often try nonprescription medicines first. you can try prescription medicines if nonprescription medicines fail to control allergy symptoms or cause drowsiness or other bothersome side effects. medication choices medicines used to treat a severe allergic reaction include: epinephrine. epinephrine is given as a shot. it acts quickly to stop the further release of histamine and to relax the muscles that help you breathe. antihistamines. antihistamines block the action of histamine during an allergic reaction and help improve symptoms such as itching and sneezing. corticosteroids. these medicines help reduce inflammation. medicines used to relieve mild food allergy symptoms include: antihistamines and corticosteroids for hives gastrointestinal symptoms or sneezing and a runny nose. bronchodilators for asthma symptoms. bronchodilators relax the airways of the lungs making it easier to breathe. what to think about medicines that treat symptoms of food allergies can have side effects. they are typically used for short periods and are discontinued as soon as symptoms are resolved. the best way to avoid symptoms is to avoid the food you are allergic to. read all food labels and be aware that sometimes food allergens are called by other names on food labels. there is no medicine that you can take before eating a certain food that will reliably prevent an allergic reaction to that food. allergy shots (desensitization therapy) for food allergies are considered experimental and are not recommended. a recent small study of a medicine for peanut allergy showed promising results. the medicine called an anti-ige drug binds to the antibodies (ige) released during an allergic reaction to peanut.  a larger study is under way to find out whether this medicine is safe and effective for people who have peanut allergies. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

lymphedema cannot be cured. however with proper care and treatment the affected limb can be restored to a normal size and shape. in addition lymphedema can be treated and controlled so that it does not progress further. if left untreated lymphedema can lead to increased swelling and a hardening of the tissue resulting in decreased function and mobility in the affected limb. it can also lead to chronic infections and other illnesses. it is important to receive treatment promptly if you recognize symptoms of lymphedema.

high folic acid may be caused by a diet rich in folic acid which is used in fortified foods and supplements and absorbed at a higher rate than folate found naturally in food. it can also be influenced by a vitamin  deficiency which causes folic acid to build up on the blood. so it makes sense to get your  levels checked to see if that is contributing to your folic acid levels. for more details on folic acid see this webmd article.

"that is possible. if she has been showing progressive signs of puberty (breast development pubic hair etc. ) for a while a brown discharge could be a small amount of menstrual blood. the clear mucous-like or sticky discharge for the last six months could have been estrogenization (the body starting to produce estrogen). menarche (the beginning of menses) is unpredictable. sometimes these initial periods of spotting or discharge hallmark the beginning of regular cycles but may not. she could easily have a first period and then not have a next period for months. she may have not had ""the movie"" on puberty at school just yet so it will be up to you to address her questions and concerns (she will have many) or visit your local bookstore. there are some wonderful books for girls regarding this subject so think about buying her one to read in private. first periods can be exciting or frightening (or even both) so having some open communication with a mother or a caring older sister is essential. mark this brown spotting on the calendar and see what happens over the next few days or few months."
conception would be highly unlikely in this case but please please please be careful.
i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. gastroenteritis is no fun! of course i'm obligated to tell you that smoking marijuana is illegal except in states that allow medical marijuana usage and then only with a valid prescription. so i can't really comment on the effect of marijuana on symptoms of gastroenteritis other than to say the medical community really doesn't know the effect of marijuana on many conditions because the substance hasn't been studied all that much. as to your gastroenteritis you need to be aware it is contagious. if you work in a food-handling environment for example you should not return to work. if necessary have your manager speak to your doctor to explain why it's a bad idea for you to return to work until your gastroenteritis has completely cleared up. if you insist on going back to work it's imperative you wash your hands frequently with warm soapy water. do not share eating utensils towels or other objects with co-workers. disinfect all food preparation areas and surfaces you touch frequently. it would be a good idea for you to inform your co-workers about the gastroenteritis so they can join with you in washing their hands frequently in order to avoid transmitting this illness among the staff and customers. i hope you feel better soon!
iron supplements can cause constipation and constipation can contribute to gas so indirectly the answer is yes.

"the different types of lupus include: systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) is the most common form. the word ""systemic"" means that the disease can involve many parts of the body. sle symptoms can be mild or serious. discoid lupus erythematosus mainly affects the skin. a red rash may appear or the skin on the face scalp or elsewhere may change color. drug-induced lupus is triggered by a few medicines. it's like sle but symptoms are usually milder. most of the time the disease goes away when the medicine is stopped. more men develop drug-induced lupus because the drugs that cause it hydralazine and procainamide are used to treat heart conditions that are more common in men."
based on a set of criteria a  level between . -. % is prediabetes. this means that there's an increased risk for developing overt diabetes. a person with prediabetes may have a normal blood sugar but only because their body has compensated for this with an increase in the amount of insulin produced. as prediabetes progresses the overproduction of insulin just won't be enough to compensate for high sugars and they become overtly abnormal and elevated. people with type  diabetes can have normal blood sugars but the metabolic abnormalities that occur will continue: insulin will continue to be produced in excess amounts. at some point it fails. and having either prediabetes or diabetes means your risk of heart disease is significantly above normal. you should modify the risks that you have: improved nutrition with calorie restriction and more fruits and veggies manage excess weight look for stress reduction methods and make good sleep a priority. seek help from a diabetes team. there are tons of information online and numerous organizations that help.
i've been dealing with panic disorder; officially since . i'm not sure there is just one singular cause of it period. it could be in your diet the air or even the water we drink. something triggers the flight / fight syndrome when there doesn't seem to be a reason for it. something is activating the adrenal glands. i do think stress; while it's hard to tell if you're under stress sometimes will cause the episodes or make them more intense. dealing with this issue; when you're new to it can cause much stress. i've been on benzodiazepines on and off since . ive been more on meds over the last  years than off. your medication doses may need adjusted but anti depressants tend to give you a boost or make you feel weird; which can kick in an attack. try looking for more holistic approaches to feeling better like change your diet see it if helps. exercise try meditation reading or listening to your favorite music and breathing exercises help a lot. the medication; should you stay on it long will eventually need changes to another type or a higher dose. my panic was so bad; i had to open my own company to stay at home whenever i had to. it usually comes and goes; as they say waxes and wanes. usually it has other phobias which develop as well. you want to steer clear of people and places which you think cause the attacks. i don't know that they will ever disappear; however they should diminish in frequency and intensity. best of luck and work on your end helps a lot!

hi found you this info should help answer your question q: am i fertile or infertile after a radical prostatectomy? a: following a successful nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy most men will have return of erections but will not be able to have children by natural means. there should be no seminal fluid after the prostatectomy so they will be infertile by natural means but with in vitro fertilization techniques it is still possible for a man to father a child after a radical prostatectomy. storing sperm in a sperm bank before the operation is a recommended procedure for those men hoping to father children after the operation. unless your worried about sti's or std's do keep using condoms if not time to put them top the back of the draw and enjoy going skin to skin that you will enjoy all because no more fumbling for a condom. is this what your looking for in the way of an answer. good luck

id visit healthcare. gov right away. with a new income status with a job loss your child may well qualify for the childrens health insurance program in your state which has coverage available regardless of health status. so i would check that out and see what the state level is for income and if thats possible. and healthcare. gov would give you that information about that public plan. in addition plans after september  will have to offer coverage to children in open enrollment periods without regard to health condition. so for the first time ever in history a lot of parents -- who have struggled with this issue with their kids who either had companies refuse to sell coverage at all or not cover the specific treatment that their child might need -- . i cant imagine as a mom anything more agonizing than having a sick child and not being  to access the care that he or she needs. but the good news is theres new coverage in the private market. on or after september  plans will have to open up coverage for kids with pre-existing conditions and there may a public option with the childrens health insurance plan that may be available for your child. so healthcare. gov will give you information about both.

i'm sorry to hear you're coping with this. you received good advice at the time of the injury. most hematomas do get resorbed by the body over time. however a small percentage do not. instead they can become encapsulated and feel like a hard painful lump beneath the skin. it's time for you to have this hematoma re-evaluated. it's possible you're one of the unlucky few whose hematoma became encapsulated. if that's the case the usual treatment is a minor surgery to remove it. wishing you well!
in the united states the flu season usually occurs from about november until april. officials have decided each new flu season will start on oct. . typically activity is very low until december and peak activity most often occurs between january and march. ideally the conventional flu vaccine should be administered between september and mid-november. it takes about one to two weeks after vaccination for antibodies against influenza to develop and provide protection. the cdc has published a summary list of their current recommendations of who should get the - vaccine: summary of influenza vaccination recommendations  all people  months and older should be vaccinated annually. protection of people at higher risk for influenza-related complications should continue to be a focus of vaccination efforts as providers and programs transition to routine vaccination of all people  months and older. when vaccine supply is limited vaccination efforts should focus on delivering vaccination to people who are  months to  years ( months) of age are  years of age and older have chronic pulmonary (including asthma) cardiovascular (except hypertension) renal hepatic neurologic hematologic or metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus) are immunosuppressed (including immunosuppression caused by medications or by human immunodeficiency virus) are or will be pregnant during the influenza season are  months to  years of age and receiving long-term aspirin therapy and who therefore might be at risk for experiencing reye's syndrome after influenza virus infection are residents of nursing homes and other chronic-care facilities are american indians/alaska natives are morbidly obese (body mass index is  or greater) are health-care personnel are household contacts and caregivers of children aged younger than  years and adults aged  years and older with particular emphasis on vaccinating contacts of children aged younger than  months; and are household contacts and caregivers of people with medical conditions that put them at higher risk for severe complications from influenza as each flu season progresses and as the cdc refines its data from previous flu seasons and pandemics this summary may be modified. the cdc publishes routine updates about the flu at flu. gov and at <link>.
hi yes cortisone injection can be taken without ultrasound guidance. once the xray is done and the exact location of the spur is noted doctor can give it without any ultrasound guidance. the doctor needs to be skillful or else if he has no confidence then it would be better to take ultrasound guidance. its a doctors call thanks
try eating smaller meals and don't eat two to three hours before bedtime. avoid foods that may trigger heartburn such as fried food citrus tomato spices peppermint chocolate and carbonated drinks. cut back on alcohol and caffeine. stop smoking if you smoke. lose weight if your doctor says you're overweight. cut back on aspirin and pain relievers if you take them often. consider trying over-the-counter antacids such as maalox or tums; acid blockers like axid pepcid tagamet and zantac; or a proton pump inhibitor like prilosec. one final precaution: always talk to your doctor about any chest pain that you may have. sometimes a mild heart attack can masquerade as heartburn and people have ignored chest pain that was really a heart attack.

before you begin an exercise program for depression here are some questions you should consider: what physical activities do i enjoy? do i prefer group or individual activities? what programs best fit my schedule? do i have physical conditions that limit my choice of exercise? what goals do i have in mind? (for example: weight loss strengthening muscles improving flexibility or mood enhancement)
it is true that the more severe the degree of obesity the greater the odds of type  diabetes. that's because the excess body fat fuels insulin resistance in the muscles and organs. there may be adverse hormonal effects on the beta cells as well. after years of insulin resistance the beta cells wear down to the point where prediabetes or full type  diabetes occurs but only in a certain fraction of indiviiduals with obesity. we don't fully understand why some people with obesity are at risk for diabetes while others can be obese their whole lives without getting it. the answer is likely in the genetics but we don't know which genes confer protection or susceptibility. similarly some thin people develop type  diabetes despite minimal insulin resistance. again the answer is in the genes but we don't know which genes.
hi having parathyroid on the aortic arch is quite risky per se. it may cause thinning of the aortic wall and cause the aorta to rupture anytime. it should definitely be removed to avoid further complications. consult a good cardiothoracic surgeon and get the parathyroid separated from the arch. it can be partially preserved iif possible. thanks
there is a moderate drug interaction between these two medications that may cause an increased occurrence of orthostatic hypotension (blood pressure suddenly falls when standing up) that subsides within two weeks of initiating adjunctive therapy. hyponatremia (low sodium) has also been seen in some cases. if you begin to experience potential signs and symptoms of hyponatremia such as headache difficulty concentrating memory impairment confusion weakness and unsteadiness (which may lead to falls) you should consult your health care provider and pharmacist. this doesnt mean that you cannot take these two medications together. work closely with your health care provider or pharmacist in monitoring yourself for any side effects associated with the drug interactions. risks and benefits should be weighed in this situation to make sure the therapy is the correct therapy for you.

hives indicate an allergy. so it could be caused from anything in his environoment -- something that he has touched (aundry detergent dryer softeners soap etc. ) or breathed (dust pollens etc). it does not have to be related to breast-feeding at all. finding a specific cause is often impossible. while you were carrying your son you might have got an allergic reaction through a food. instead of it infecting you it ran to your bany and produced over the months.
"tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria whose scientific name is mycobacterium tuberculosis. it was first isolated in  by a german physician named robert koch who received the nobel prize for this discovery. tb most commonly affects the lungs but also can involve almost any organ of the body. many years ago this disease was referred to as ""consumption"" because without effective treatment these patients often would waste away. today of course tuberculosis usually can be treated successfully with antibiotics. there is also a group of organisms referred to as atypical tuberculosis. these involve other types of bacteria that are in the mycobacterium family. often these organisms do not cause disease and are referred to a ""colonizers "" because they simply live alongside other bacteria in our bodies without causing damage. at times these bacteria can cause an infection that is sometimes clinically like typical tuberculosis. when these atypical mycobacteria cause infection they are often very difficult to cure. often drug therapy for these organisms must be administered for one-and-a-half to two years and requires multiple medications."
this is a fungal or bacterial infection it needs urgent treatment with antibiotics and the pus must be removed with a surgeon.
you need to see a urologist for a careful examination. there can be many problems associated with your lack of ejaculation but retrograde ejaculation may be a strong consideration. during orgasm your semen may be going into your bladder and not out of your penis. it is very important that you see a urologist (even if you don't want to go).

the penis reaches its maximum size at age  so there is really no chance yours will really increase in size any more. not knowing the accuracy of your measurement or whether this was done when erect or flaccid the average size of an erect penis is around six inches. smaller penises increase in size more when erect than larger penises. in spite of what you hear or even see penises (when erect) do not vary more than an inch or two across the wide range of humans of different races or genetics. it is not the size of your penis that matters. you do not judge an artist by the size of his paint brush. the size of penis is not the measure of man but rather who you are as a caring and compassionate person. i tried all penis enlargement product. pills not working. only natural penis enlargement exercise working. i tryed it. i enlargement .  inch about in  month. look from here <link>

yes. that will help.
swine flu shots are voluntary for most americans. for those not in the military there is no federal requirement to get the  swine flu vaccine. active-duty military personnel national guard troops on active duty and civilian defense department employees in critical jobs will be required to get the vaccine. health care workers may be required by their employers to get vaccinated. the state of new york for example has mandated both seasonal and  swine flu vaccinations for all health care workers.

most helpful answer instead of thinking putting a cap on protein your better off balancing the type of protein foods in your diet. here are some tips: don't exceed  ounces of animal protein like chicken fish beef lamb or pork daily.  ounces is the size of a deck of card. you can get additional protein from low fat dairy sources such as yogurt milk and low fat cheese. plant sources of protein like nuts and nut butters are good and healthy too. avoid certain type of meat like organ meats an fish such as anchovies herring scallops trout and tuna. a dietitian can help individualize information to your specific preferences and lifestyle. journal about your trigger out your trigger foods -- see this article.

it's generally recommended that losing no more than  pounds a week is a safe and effective way to lose weight and keep it off. it may not sound like much but  pounds a week for  weeks is  pounds! often when beginning a weight loss and exercise program you can lose more weight during the first week -- especially if you are considerably overweight. but don't be discouraged if the weight loss tapers to one or two pounds per week. you are still moving in the right direction.
"insurance or not making an accurate diagnosis is required before a treatment plan is determined. i know this injury is untimely but these things happen. if your car broke down your car insurance wouldn't fix it. you would have to come up with the money to do it. the same deal goes with your husband. borrow money. charge the visit to a credit card. have the facility bill you and pay later. either way the evaluation needs to be done first. there is absolutely no way for me or any medical professional to be able to tell you the reason for his ""side pain"" since we don't even know which side or the location on that side. without knowing his medical history i couldn't even recommend ibuprofen. get him the care he needs. worry about paying for it later. an urgent care facility is a fraction of the cost of an er so this is what i suggest. most even have their own x-rays."

"heart failure is caused by many conditions that damage the heart muscle including: coronary artery disease: cad a disease of the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart causes decreased blood flow to the heart muscle. if the arteries become blocked the heart becomes starved for oxygen and nutrients. this condition along with heart attack is responsible for two thirds of heart failure cases in the u. s. heart attack: a heart attack may occur when a coronary artery becomes suddenly blocked stopping the flow of blood to the heart muscle and damaging it. all or part of the heart muscle becomes cut off from its supply of oxygen. a heart attack can damage the heart muscle resulting in a scarred area that does not function properly. ""non-ischemic"" cardiomyopathy: this condition occurs when there is damage to the heart muscle from causes other than artery or blood flow problems such as from infections or alcohol or drug abuse. conditions that overwork the heart: high blood pressure (hypertension) valve disease thyroid disease kidney disease diabetes or heart defects present at birth can all cause heart failure (some of these are non-ischemic cardiomyopathy -- see above). in addition heart failure can occur when several diseases or conditions are present at once."

vanishingly unlikely. your saliva is your first defense against viruses. as you may have heard before hiv is a pretty weak virus - it dies easily outside the body. you would have to rub it into an open wound. please don't tell me you also have an open wound in your mouth. also just for hygiene's sake what are you doing going around licking other people's blood off your finger? and how exactly are you getting someone's blood on your finger? and finally how in the world do you know they are hiv positive? sounds like you are engaged in some pretty interesting activities and you might want to rethink your life. of course you may have a perfectly plausible explanation as to why you are getting hiv positive blood on your finger and licking it.

well this certainly deserves to be investigated by a medical professional. i can think of a number of conditions that could cause the symptoms you describe. hypoglycemia possibly. but also seizure and stroke. so it's important to get a true diagnosis and not rely on what he was told decades ago as a child. i'd suggest you start by calling your primary health care provider for an exam and blood work. that will give you and your husband a good start. wishing you all the best!

"i don't know if it is ok to mix the asa with the ""handful"" of vitamins and supplements because i need to know the exact ingredients. one of the problems we have with this area is that there are not a lot of well-controlled studies for us to look at so it is kind of taking a risk. i would advise bringing in all of your vitamins and supplements into your pharmacist and they can try to see based on some of the limited references we have. the other question i have for you is if your health care provider recommended taking the asa  mg? i highly recommend you carry a personal medication list that contains everything that you are taking and show it to every health care provider and pharmacist you visit!"
hi yes it is possible to have periods and be pregnant but these periods are just very light and only last  days if her test was negative then she's probable not pregnant. just by stopping the use of condoms does not mean pregnancy its all down to timing. the first day of her period is day one of her cycle around day  is ovulation day give or take a day your sperm needs to be there waiting for it so you need to have unprotected sex around day ? why it takes your sperm  days to get in place to fertilise her egg. now all being well on day  she gets some spotting this could that she is pregnant its could implantation day. now if you have been having lots of sex to get pregnant wrong your sperm needs to be mature having lots of sex means your sperm is im-mature and wont fertilise an egg. do hope this helps you and your wife. good luck

i would really like to ask how you feel and if this is taking care of the pain? if you are still is pain have you spoken to your doctor or health care provider to let them know? you should not take more than what was prescribed. what we are finding out is that pain therapy has to be individualized and that is why it's important to let your doctor or health care provider know if you are still experiencing pain -- they may need to adjust your medications. it is fine to take the naproxen and robaxin together because they work differently to treat pain.

"drug interactions may change how your medications work or increase your risk for serious side effects. this document does not contain all possible drug interactions. keep a list of all the products you use (including prescription/nonprescription drugs and herbal products) and share it with your doctor and pharmacist. do not start stop or change the dosage of any medicines without your doctor's approval. some products that may interact with this drug include: cidofovir corticosteroids (such as prednisone) high blood pressure drugs (including ace inhibitors such as captopril lisinopril and angiotensin ii receptor blockers such as losartan valsartan). this medication may increase the risk of bleeding when taken with other drugs that also may cause bleeding. examples include anti-platelet drugs such as clopidogrel ""blood thinners"" such as dabigatran/enoxaparin/warfarin among others. check all prescription and nonprescription medicine labels carefully since many medications contain pain relievers/fever reducers (including aspirin nsaids such as celecoxib ketorolac or naproxen). these drugs are similar to ibuprofen and may increase your risk of side effects if taken together. however if your doctor has directed you to take low-dose aspirin for heart attack or stroke prevention (usually at dosages of - milligrams a day) you should continue taking the aspirin unless your doctor instructs you otherwise. daily use of ibuprofen may decrease aspirin's ability to prevent heart attack/stroke. talk to your doctor about using a different medication (such as acetaminophen) to treat pain/fever. if you must take ibuprofen talk to your doctor about possibly taking immediate-release aspirin (not enteric-coated/ec) while taking ibuprofen. take ibuprofen at least  hours before or at least  minutes after your aspirin dose. do not increase your daily dose of aspirin or change the way you take aspirin/other medications without your doctor's approval."

hello i have googled this specific question with the intention of answering all the queries that exist on the web with regards to this question because i myself had been suffering this for the last  months and it made me feel really sick uneasy and tired and i hated the feeling of having to always keep myself in cool places and have to have three baths a day to just feel normal. i finally found the cure in an unlikely place. i have always had a little feeling of sickness when in warm places since a young age but it got really bad  months back and every normal doctor i went to did all medical checks but all parameters such as blood pressure temperature and blood test etc were normal but i still was feeling heat since i am in india somebody suggested i visit an ayurvedic doctor(ayurvedic doctors are doctors who prescribe medicines and treatments according to an ancient indian text called the ayurveda <link> so i made the trip to a well known ayurvedic doctor at the rejuvenation center at an ashram called isha in coimbatore tamil nadu india and the doctor there just felt my wrist and started her diagnosis and without me even telling her the symptoms she said everything is normal but there is a lot of heat trapped in your system and she said it is not a very rare problem she said that no mainstream medicine doctor has been able to diagnose it till date cause there is no such thing as body heat in allopathic(mainstream) medicine there is only temperature she said in ayurveda it's called ushna(heat) and she said no need to go into the cause of it just have these ayurvedic medicines and i have been having them for three days now and i can feel the heat slowly leaving my system i am suppose to take the medicines for  days but just today being the third day i am already feelin % better and ease has returned to the whole body and she also gave me some medicines to repair the minor damage to the system from this heat so i would like to suggest to anybody who is having this problem that if no doctor is able to help then please no matter what country you are in please look for a good ayurvedic or siddha(<link> doctor nowadays they are all over the world and if there isn't one in your country then do make the trip to india and i highly recommend the one i went to even if it is expensive to make the trip it is better to spend that then live with the problem for the rest of your life or contact them at <link> they might be able to ship the medicines if you are in a different country. hope you'll all get okay soon cause i have been through the frustrating experience of going to many mainstream doctors and not finding a solution till this happened and i feel like a real fool for doubting that any alternative medicine science could actually have something very simple but powerful in it.

there is not one straight answer. you need to work with a doctor to discover why it is high which may be caused by medical conditions. that being said diet may help bring it down. eating a diet rich in plant foods and low in saturated fats is key. also adding fatty fish twice a week (or fish oil if you don't eta fish) and healthy fats like nuts avocado and olive oil can help as well. lowering your intake of sugar nd refined carbohydrates is also part of an anti-inflammation diet. this article outlines important diet changes you can make to lower your crp which is a marker for inflammation. good luck!

it would not be possible to blindly determine over the internet if your prior injury --  years ago -- is somehow related to your current symptoms. i think it would be wise for you to see an orthopedist and have a hands-on evaluation and some imaging studies. then you will hopefully know.
the only sure-fire way to avoid getting genital herpes is to abstain from sex or have sex only with someone who is also herpes-free. short of that a latex condom offers some protection if it covers the infected area. remember you can get genital herpes by receiving oral sex (fellatio cunnilingus analingus) from someone with a cold sore on the mouth. likewise you can get oral herpes from someone's genitals by way of oral sex. if you know that a sex partner has genital herpes you can reduce your risk by having sex (vaginal anal or oral intercourse) only when he or she has no symptoms. nevertheless genital herpes can be contagious even when there are no visible symptoms so you should always use a latex barrier such as a condom or a dental dam.

if you test was acccurate you were exposed in the past by someone. unfortunately it is not possible to know who or when this might have occured. once you have genital herpes it can go dormant. suppressed by your immune system. as we age that immune system can become weaker and the herpes virus can reactivate again. herpes exposure could have occured anytime in your life; even more than  years ago. there are medications to help limit these outbreaks should this happen again so please discuss this with your doctor.

the answer really needs to be individual. you need to decide from a personal point of view from a social point of view and a religious point of view what is best for your child. i used to say that if the fathers circumcised from an identity point of view its always good for the son to be because when he looks in the shower looking up at dad its nice that part a matches part a they bond that way. but the truth is theres not any absolute clear reason to have to have it. yes better hygiene. yes its easier to maintain with cleanliness the risk for penile cancer is lower in circumcised men but thats extremely rare in this country. if you maintain normal hygiene penile cancer is unheard of. so the benefits are really more social we do know there are some studies that its rarer to contract hiv and other illness because the circumcised penis the skin becomes a little bit thicker so its a little less likely to be something during sex less chance for infections. the uncircumcised penis again has more risks as far as scarring as you get older where it scars down or you have to have a circumcision or other technique to open it and also concerns over hygiene. but realistically in this day and age if the boy is clean theres no biological need to have it its really more of a personal or religious social.
actually for self-treatment in the field we don't really encourage travelers to touch base with a provider before starting treatment. many travelers will be in areas where providers may not be up to the standard of care that travelers are used to or may be in places where the medications they can obtain are not safe -- there is a big market in counterfeit medications in some developing nations. so we urge people to get the medications they may need -- and some education on when and how to use them -- from their provider before traveling. then they can self-treat as long as they have only a mild to moderate case of travelers' diarrhea.
unfortunately it's impossible to say what this might be without a physical exam. i'd say the most likely possibility is an inguinal hernia. but only a medical professional conducting a physical exam can say for sure. less likely explanations are a sexually transmitted disease like syphilis and cancer. it's also possible this is a cyst (non-cancerous) or lipoma (also non-cancerous). i'd suggest you call your primary health care provider and have this looked at. take care!

the only way to lose weight is to take in fewer calories than you burn. a vegetarian diet doesnt necessarily mean you will lose weight. a lot of very fattening foods are vegetarian such as desserts french fries candy and snack bars. usually deciding to be a vegetarian is more about a philosophy than losing weight. the basics of achieving and maintaining a healthy weight are the same for vegetarians and nonvegetarians; you need to count your calories and exercise. lean meats are healthier and lower in calories than meats that are fatty. talk to the butcher in your grocery store about which are the leaner meats. beef that is labeled prime choice or select is usually lower in fat. leaner cuts of beef include tenderloin round and sirloin. ground beef for hamburgers will have the percentage of lean meat on the label so choose those with % or higher lean meat. for chicken buy the white meat from the breast and take off the skin. fish is another great alternative to lean meats to get high quality protein. cod flounder haddock salmon tilapia trout and tuna are excellent choices. seafood is another alternative and includes shrimp scallops lobster and crab. the best diet is one that you can stick with. limiting your food choices isnt necessary to lose weight. take the good from each diet plan. try to include dried beans used in vegetarian diets into several meals per week. they are a great source of protein and are loaded with fiber. put yourself on an exercise plan to help with weight loss. remember that losing weight slowly is healthier. learning to eat healthy is a lifestyle change and it doesnt happen overnight.
i'm not sure if you really mean the knee itself is dislocating or if it is the kneecap. big difference. obviously it is not normal for anyone's knee to dislocate -- certainly not three times in a single year. possible explanations for this would include trauma or orthopedic abnormalities. your best bet is to consult a pediatric orthopedic specialist. he or she can examine the child perform some imaging studies (like x-ray or mri) and suggest ways to treat the problem. repeatedly dislocating a joint can cause many other issues later in life including arthritis and ligament problems. you should not allow this situation to continue without getting a medical expert involved. wishing you well!

"adult teeth are typically darker than baby teeth and that is normal. if the teeth are brown your child might have had high fever at about age  and was given antibiotics (tetracycline) this is the result. i am assuming that the oral hygiene is good and that the color is not surface stain. it is commonly called ""tetracycline staining. "" there is nothing to do at this time. you must consult with your pediatric dentist first and foremost. make sure that this is the correct diagnosis. when the teeth finally erupt bleaching can be successful at times. many times adults end up with porcelain laminate veneers to cover the staining. however the best thing to do is nothing. any dental work has a ""life span"" and an untouched tooth is always better for the long-term health. the darker color in itself is not a problem physically just esthetically. please go see a pediatric dentist to confirm the proper diagnosis for your child."

i suspect that it is still broke at three weeks and it still may be overlapping. collarbones (clavicles) are notoriously slow to heal especially when the bone is not joined. you would need to have another x-ray to check the status of your fracture.
there are several options available over the counter to treat allergy symptoms for a -year-old. loratadine and cetirizine are the two newest otc antihistamines available. the advantage to these medications is that they work for a full  hours and you only need to take them once a day. cetirizine found in zyrtec tends to cause a bit more drowsiness than loratadine which is found in claritin. you should talk to your daughter's pediatrician if she is having severe allergies to ensure an over-the-counter antihistamine is appropriate for her at this time.

it is not recommended that you apply ice to a burn because the ice can stick to the skin and do additional damage. you do not want to puncture the blister because that could bring on an infection. continue to watch it and for the pain you can try taking an acetaminophen product like tylenol. if it continues to get worse you will need to see a health care provider.

hashimoto's thyroiditis is not a reason to avoid pregnancy. however some women with hashimoto's thyroiditis do have trouble conceiving. in some patients supplementation with selenium is used to try to decrease antibody levels. (the theory is that lower antibody levels may lead to better success in conception. ) both before and during pregnancy the levels of thyroid hormones need to be checked to make certain they are in the optimal range for pregnancy. this is usually within the range for nonpregnant women but at the higher end of the range.

that's a great question for your primary care provider. obstructive sleep apnea (osa) is a common disorder in which a person stops breathing for brief periods of time during sleep. this can in turn lower a person's blood oxygen concentration levels. low oxygen levels in the blood can damage the heart muscle over time. so i'd suggest you make an appointment to discuss the situation with your primary health care provider. he or she can advise you as to whether you should have a cardiac workup done in light of your new diagnosis. take care! i was trying to find the best place that would have information on this subject. i did a sleep study for  hours and it showed that i stopped breathing  times during the study? so i am aware that if your blood  is too high and  is too low your brain could be affected. i was put on a cpap machine but was told by the medical supply team that the doctor wants me on a bpap? what is a bpap? how do i find out which one of my  doctors recommended the change and why?
two important things to note here are growth and hydration. if your child is growing steadily as shown on his growth chart and is having plenty of wet diapers than that is a good sign. diarrhea that results in dehydration or slowed growth is problematic. you also might want to try a formula with probiotics (good bacteria for the gut) to see if that helps. if you are still concerned ask to be referred to a pediatric gastroenterologist. they can perform some tests and have the appropriate experience to troubleshoot potential solutions or let you know everything is fine. trust your instincts and get the help you need!
"leave it alone. there are natural adhesions attaching the head of the penis to the foreskin at this age. forcibly retracting the foreskin can be very painful so just clean what you can see. it may be red because you are causing very tiny micro-tears in his foreskin. some children do have very tight foreskins so please allow the pediatrician to make that determination during an examination. most of the men/boys in the world are uncircumcised just the way nature made them. as he ages those natural adhesions will resolve and his foreskin will completely retract. if not there are prescription steroid creams that can be used to help it along. in my pediatric practice i rarely intervene medically until age  or  (unless the foreskin is super-tight and it ""balloons"" when he urinates). if this is the case a pediatric urologist should be consulted."
i'm a redneck country boy. with enough since and kids to let you know that yeap you could be pregnant. that you should have been hog tied and burnt because the tubes can come untied.
i don't know what kind of ear drops you are using. or your diagnosis but a clogged ear and muffled hearing can be caused by a combination of any ear drop combined with an ample supply of liquefied earwax. this may need to be lavaged (irrigated out) or suction out by your doctor again assuming your ear is currently not painful.
having had kidney stones myself i am personally familiar with the do's and don't of diet but i have not heard of peppers (the color is not relevant) being banned. i think you will find this article helpful. <link>
you need to get ultra sonogrsphy of abdonen and amylase test. it is probably pancreatitis. which needs immediate admission to the hospital. thanks
hi. it can be due to gaseous distention pain or irritable bowel syndrome. in such cases the pain is regular and constant sometimes spasmodic. its better if you get usg abdomen done to see whats wrong. consult a gastroenterologist. thanks
"yes. anxiety and/or depression would be a normal human response to knowing that you have an ""uncurable severe illness"". treating the anxiety is just as important as trying to treat the illness. i have two types of multiple sclerosis. have had it since i was . it is very normal to have anxiety. don't let it overcome you though. take charge as much as can handle and don't hesitate to ask for help. good luck i am a cna that works at an independent living apartment complex for age group - (just celebrated a  birthday there) many of my people are not far off from being put on hospice. some get depressed for a bit and others look at it as a blessing. in my experience the persons age has alot to do with how much anxiety is shown. one commonality is they all have such great attitudes about living and seeing what the future holds. the 'anxiety' is most definitely present at the beginning. most of them want to make the most out of the time they have left leaving out any treatments that will cause them to be bed bound or will slow them down in anyway. i think the sooner a person comes to terms with their condition and lives to the fullest of their capabilities anxiety will ease."
yes you can get pregnant even if he didnt ejaculate. there could be a hormonal disorder going on too which often messes with the menstrual cycle.
i would wait to take a test until the actual day of your expected period then take one if negitive take another the following week.
in my opinion you must be suffering gastric related disorder and cefdinir is not to be blamed for this. it could be ibs or celiac disease. note than gluten is sometimes found in most oatmeal types so it could be gluten sensitivity which is not related to the antibiotic which will never stay in your body all of this period.
it sounds like you may have a condition called alopecia areata. we don't know what causes it but this is typically a temporary condition and your hair will eventually grow back. however corticosteroid injections can help the hair grow back. you should see a dermatologist to make sure that's what's going on and to determine the right treatment.
anyone can get lupus. but  out of  people who have it are women. african american women are three times more likely to get lupus than white women. it's also more common in hispanic/latino asian and american indian women. both african americans and hispanics/latinos tend to develop lupus at a younger age and have more symptoms at diagnosis (including kidney problems). they also tend to have more severe disease than whites. for example african american patients have more seizures and strokes while hispanic/latino patients have more heart problems.
your sore throat and chest problems may have confused your doctors yet if you have roled out tonilitis and ra then you should perform ct scan on your neck and lumber vertebra i wish you could provide your age and sex for better diagnosis also is your leg pain in one leg or both? good luck
no it would not. if you want to throw a wiffle ball a tennis ball or even a cotton ball for the fun of it just do it. it will not damage your shoulder any more than any other repetitive throwing. repeated throwing of anything however could damage your shoulder over time if you are not careful and well-conditioned. you need to strengthen those shoulder muscles lift some light weights do some stretching/range of motion activities and get the proper rest between throwing. i am not sure what kind of ball you are throwing (i suspect a baseball) but stay on top of your game.
that is really up to you. it is for your protection not to advertise to the world that you are diabetic. if you go into a diabetic coma for some reason the paramedics and/or police will see the bracelet and get you prompt and appropriate medical care that could save your life. you don't have to wear an exposed bracelet. you can wear a tiny necklace that is hidden or put a card in your wallet. medical alert bracelets can also warn people of serious allergies and other medical conditions. if i found you lying in the street i would quickly determine that you are diabetic (and not drunk and passed out since you can have an acetone smell on your breath). until we all have embedded chips in our necks with essential medical information the bracelets and necklaces are the best that we can do.
indemnity insurance is a type of major medical plan. they enable you to direct your own health care and visit almost any doctor or hospital you like with no need for referrals. these types of plans are rare these days. most people are covered by a ppo or hmo where you get a higher level of insurance coverage when you get care from the plan's network of providers.
find a well lit clean flat work surface like a table and collect all the supplies you will need to give yourself or receive an injection. take one avonex administration dose pack out of the refrigerator about  minutes before you plan on injecting your dose to allow it to reach room temperature. a room temperature solution is more comfortable to inject. you will need the following supplies: single-use prefilled syringe sterile needle alcohol wipe gauze pad adhesive bandage a puncture resistant container for disposal of used syringes and needles. preparing the avonex prefilled syringe. it is important to keep your work area your hands and your injection site clean to minimize risk of infection. you should wash your hands prior to handling the syringe. check the expiration date. the expiration date is printed on the avonex prefilled syringe syringe package and the carton. do not use if the medication is expired. check the contents of the syringe. the solution in the syringe should be clear and colorless. if the solution is colored or cloudy do not use the syringe. get a new syringe. check the cap on the end of the syringe to confirm it is attached and has not been opened. if the cap is not securely attached or appears to have been opened do not use that syringe. call your pharmacist. hold the syringe so the cap is facing down and the .  ml mark is at eye level. check to make sure the amount of liquid in the syringe is the same or very close to the .  ml mark. if the syringe does not have the correct amount of liquid do not use that syringe. call your pharmacist. hold the avonex® prefilled syringe upright so that the cap is pointing up. remove the cap by bending it at a ° angle until it snaps free. open the package with the  gauge -¼ inch needle. attach the needle by pressing it onto the syringe and turning it clockwise until it locks in place. note: if you do not firmly attach the needle to the syringe it may leak so you may not get your full dose of avonex. be careful not to push the plunger while attaching the needle. selecting an injection site. you should use a different site each time you inject. this can be as simple as switching between thighs (if you are always injecting yourself) or if another person is helping you you can rotate between your upper arms and your thighs. keeping a record of the date and location of each injection will help you. do not inject into an area of the body where the skin is irritated reddened bruised infected or scarred in any way. the best sites for intramuscular injection are the thigh and upper arm: thigh upper arm injecting the avonex dose. use the alcohol wipe to clean the skin at the injection site you choose. then pull the protective cover straight off the needle; do not twist the cover off. with one hand stretch the skin out around the injection site. hold the syringe like a pencil with the other hand and using a quick motion insert the needle at a  degree angle through the skin and into the muscle. once the needle is in let go of the skin and slowly push the plunger down until the syringe is empty. take the gauze pad and hold it near the needle at the injection site and pull the needle straight out. use the gauze pad to apply pressure to the site for a few seconds or rub gently in a circular motion. if there is bleeding at the site wipe it off and if necessary apply an adhesive bandage. after two hours check the injection site for redness swelling or tenderness. if you have a skin reaction and it does not clear up in a few days contact your doctor or nurse. dispose of the used syringe and needle in your puncture resistant container. this is a single-use syringe. do not use a syringe or needle more than once. disposal of syringes and needles. there may be special state and/or local laws for disposing of used needles and syringes. your doctor nurse or pharmacist should provide you with instructions on how to dispose of your used needles and syringes. always keep your disposal container out of the reach of children. do not throw used needles and syringes into the household trash and do not recycle.
"and something that you can always ask your pharmacist when you pick up your medication. the term ""bid"" means twice a day or every  hours. i recommend to patients that if they take their medication at  a. m. then they should take their next dose at  p. m. if you are ever unsure about how or when to take your medication talk to your pharmacist."
the risk of infection from needlestick injuries depends on: the factors that influence exposure to a greater volume of blood (for example: visible blood on the device needle which has been placed directly into an artery or a vein of an hiv positive person). viral load of the source patient. deeper injuries and by hollow-bore needles (especially those needles with larger gauges). diabetics use fine gauge needle and that too for injecting insulin into the skin rather than into a blood vessel. moreover the needlestick injury you have mentioned here actually did not prick deep enough you just touched the needle and i think your chances are minimal if at all. are you unsure about the hiv status of the patient? if you are sure that the used needle belongs to him and no one else and if you know the person very well you may straight away go and tell him/her about the incident and your reason to be anxious and inquire about the person's hiv status. that would be the easiest way. you may get a hiv combo test (antigen and antibody based test) done after  month of exposure for your own peace of mind. consult a hiv aids specialist online for further help --> <link>

herpes simplex viruses -- more commonly known as herpes -- are categorized into two types: herpes type  (hsv- or oral herpes) and herpes type  (hsv- or genital herpes). most commonly herpes type  causes sores around the mouth and lips (sometimes called fever blisters or cold sores). hsv- can cause genital herpes but most cases of genital herpes are caused by herpes type . in hsv- the infected person may have sores around the genitals or rectum. although hsv- sores may occur in other locations these sores usually are found below the waist.
hi when its comes to women being pregnant it can happen all sorts of ways even when on bc but if you mean an iud then it does get a bit tricky it means it must have slipped out a bit for it to happen. but it is possible for a women to be pregnant and still have a period or periods even if it sounds odd. i think the best thing for you would be see your doctor and get a test done there. hope this helps a bit. good luck
hi well being on a two day bender not a really bright idea was it well this could be the side effect of that. you ask am i pregnant of an std there are tests for both pregnancy either an hpt or go see your doctor as for the std try an std/gum clinic and get some tests done. see help for both. good luck
i don't know. i can't see them. your description of red bumps is way too vague for me to even guess. a medical provider would need to examine you first-hand to offer you a definitive answer.
its definitely not  deficiency- i eat plenty of animal protein. ive never heard of blisters or brown skin splotches being related to  deficiency? why type of skin infection could it be? like i said in the op there is no itchiness change in size or shape or color theres no scabbing or texture or inflammation or anything!
if you have no other insurance coverage such as medicaid you can shop for coverage via the new health insurance marketplace. it's likely you'll qualify for financial help to pay for coverage. you can start searching your options at healthcare. gov.
"sorry you're going through this. while you're obviously young to have heart trouble that's always the first thing that comes to mind when someone complains of ""chest pain. "" in fact if your chest pain begins to feel like a crushing or squeezing type discomfort that won't go away you definitely should go to the emergency room. however i think the more likely culprit here is a condition called costochondritis. this is an inflammation of the cartilage between the rib and the sternum (breastbone) near the top of the sternum. it's quite common in young women. several things can cause it but it's not usually serious. you probably should have this checked out by a medical professional just to be on the safe side. but unless you're having other symptoms of a heart attack i wouldn't run off to the emergency room. just get in to see your primary care provider as soon as you can. feel better soon!"
i'm very sorry you're going through this. i strongly suggest you make an appointment with your doctor to have this situation evaluated. many conditions can cause a frequent urge to pee and the source of the problem also can depend on whether you're a man or a woman. your doctor can perform a physical examination to determine the right treatment for the cause of your overactive bladder and urinary incontinence symptoms. meanwhile you may feel more confident by using pads or briefs designed for urinary incontinence. that way if you don't make it to the bathroom you'll have a pad to catch the pee instead of getting everything wet. i wish you all the best with this!
hi i recommend checking your blood glucose and doing a brain angiography have you been traveling lately? good luck
your husband should be tested for sleep apnea right away! he is probably sleep deprived and his heart health is at risk. does he snore? and like snort and wake himself up? that's because he has stopped breathing. there are many reasons for sleep apnea. also if he has a cold or sinus congestion or cluster headaches that can cause these symptoms. but i am thinking he has sleep apnea. after i found out that i have sleep apnea and started treatment on my c-pap machine it took about a week to get used to having the mask on but within  weeks i noticed that i was thinking more clearly and had way more energy! call an ear nose throat doctor and they will get you started!
the best time to eat after taking insulin depends on three major factors. first the type of insulin you are taking the type of food you are eating and your current blood glucose level. there are two major types of insulin taken before meals rapid acting and short acting. rapid acting insulins include lispro (humalog) insulin aspart (novolog) and insulin glulisine (apidra). its generally best to inject these insulins up to  minutes before you plan to eat. for the short acting insulins humulin r and novolin r the timing is  to  minutes prior to the meal. if you wait longer than these times you run the risk of having a low blood glucose level. the type of food also impacts the timing of insulin. carbohydrates have the most effect on glucose levels. meals that are high in fat slow down the absorption of carbohydrates. so eating a pizza which has a lot of fat may not affect your glucose level as quickly as eating a bowl of cereal. protein usually has a small effect on your blood glucose levels. thirdly your blood glucose level prior to eating is important. having a low blood glucose level and then taking insulin and waiting to eat may cause your blood glucose level to drop even further. if your blood glucose level is high before you eat you may need to add extra insulin as recommended by your doctor to compensate for the high blood glucose level. in terms of how much to eat that depends on your weight your dietary needs and your insulin to carbohydrate ratio. this ratio is how many grams of carbohydrates one unit of insulin covers. this is a very individualized number that your doctor will decide when prescribing insulin to you. the important point is to talk with your doctor nurse educator and dietician about the timing of eating and insulin. keep a diary of the different foods you like to eat so that you can gain insight into what happens when you eat that meal. be sure to mark down the grams of carbohydrates in the meal so your doctor can evaluate your insulin to carbohydrate ratio. check your blood glucose level  hours after eating to see what effect the meal has on your glucose level. remember that many other factors affect your reaction to insulin such as exercise a cold and stress. diabetes is a chronic disease and the more you understand about the factors affecting you the better your glucose control will become.  mins. i think you should have your meal first then straight after take your insulin. then you can work out how much insulin to take depending on how much you ate and also what you ate. bbbb an hr later.
yes i am sure you can find an orthopedic (hand) surgeon willing to do take a crack at it (no pun intended) but you could be asking for more trouble than it is worth. in order to get a better cosmetic result it will require a re-break and perhaps a pinning of the metacarpal in order to straighten out the bent digit. the orthopedist will tell you the pros and cons and hopefully your insurance company will be agreeable to paying for it.
you can look for a high deductible plan with a hsa and given that your family is healthy and doesn't go to the doctor frequently that may be a good option for you. this option is likely to keep your premiums lower and will allow you to put money aside in the hsa account to pay for medical care tax free. and as long as you spend the money in the account on qualified health services you'll be able to spend it tax-free as well.
research suggests that all oats are good for you. three-quarters of a cup seems to be the magical amount. it's the soluble fiber that may play role in the aging process. an interesting thing about oatmeal: it makes your body produce nitric oxide which helps blood to flow more freely. that allows more oxygen and nutrients to all the cells including skin cells.
it looks like your doctor is treating you for rheumatoid arthritis. however what is not clear is the fact that how this conclusion was arrived at. have they done these tests - esr crp rheumatoid factor blood test anti-ccp antibodies test? how long does the morning stiffness last? how many joints in the finger/hands do you experience pain and actual tenderness? i am asking these questions inorder to match your signs and symptoms with eular or the new american college of rheumatology guidelines. also i wonder why methotrexate was not started as a primary drug. please clarify the above with your doctor. now coming to living with symptoms you should respond in a reasonable period of time say  weeks at maximum both clinically and with regards to the inflammatory markers crp esr etc. if this is not happening a review of diagnosis and medicines must be done. finally the scoliosis per se does not cause pain and neither does hypermobility unless they are long standing and gross. perhaps seeing a good manual therapist is a way forward to control your spinal symptoms. hope this helps and revert back to a rheumatologist online for further follow up --> <link>
highly likely and dispose of your sperm-laden tissues properly in the toilet and flush them away. it would not be likely that any woman would decide on using a used wet tissue to wipe themselves after going to the toilet but dispose of them anyway. viable sperm quickly dies after being exposed to air and i know of no cases where a pregnancy was caused by a sperm-laden tissue.
i had a bad rash on my arm after getting poison ivy while fishing weeks after it had went away it had returned in the same spots and after that finally went away after weeks it has recently returned again. i've washed everything clothes sheets etc with no luck. please let me know if you've had or are having a similar experience.
yes
the chance of you getting a serious infection or parasite (trichinosis) from a few bites of undercooked pork or this incident harming your baby would be extremely small. assuming you are in the united states and are eating inspected meat from a reliable grocery store or butcher ultimately from a highly-inspected meat-packing facility these pork-related events are very very unusual. now if you ate undercooked pork from a wild boar someone shot or from a dubious supplier that is a different issue. call your ob or primary care medical provider with your story so you can have some patient-specific advice but in the meantime. relax. you and your baby are probably going to be perfectly fine and your mother is going to be over-cooking pork to the point of burning it from now on!
hi even though you are used to cannabis still there may have been an overdose of cannabis this time that may have caused this. cannabis causes sympathetic stimulation causing faster heart rate palpitations and giddiness. though it not much of worry as the effects are usually temporary you should get an ecg done. thanks
absolutely not.
for hepatitis c combination therapy using pegylated interferon and ribavirin is currently the treatment of choice.
if overdose is suspected contact a poison control center or emergency room immediately. us residents can call the us national poison hotline at ---. canada residents can call a provincial poison control center.
hi i do not think there is any reason to post pone surgery. you can continue taking the drops every  hourly till surgery. however final decision for surgery should be taken by ur treating opthalmologist. you should inform him about the missed drops as soon as possible. avoid high doses of prednisolone. thanks

hi if your masturbating more that once a day it may be best you take a break for over masturbation its best you take an  week break from masturbation and any kind of sexual contact. when you start to get morning woods and nocturnal erections you will know your on the mend but as you have been at this for  years it may take a few weeks longer. porn is a great sex killer and if you have been masturbating to porn then this is also stacked against you and your sex life so porn has got to go the way to do this is shut down all your porn sites clear out of your computer all porn downloads and then anything you have on discs just throw them away get a friend to install the porn lock on your computer and they keep the password. doing all this with luck you may get your sex life back but it may take some time porn shuts down your sexual receptors and away goes your sex life. if things are not working just come back through answer this above. but do hope this helps you. good luck
you should see your dentist. although many people have receding gums as they age it sounds like you need a periodontal evaluation. i dont believe that vitamins will cure periodontal disease.
congestive heart failure is generally a progressive disease with periods of stability punctuated by episodic clinical exacerbations. the course of the disease in any given individual however is extremely variable. factors involved in determining the long term outlook (prognosis) for a given patient include: the nature of the underlying heart disease the response to medications the degree to which other organ systems are involved and the severity of other accompanying conditions the person's symptoms and degree of impairment other factors that remain poorly understood with the availability of newer drugs to potentially favorably affect the progression of disease the prognosis in congestive heart failure is generally more favorable than that observed just  years ago. in some cases especially when the heart muscle dysfunction has recently developed a significant spontaneous improvement is not uncommonly observed even to the point where heart function becomes normal. heart failure is often graded on a scale of i to iv based on the patient's ability to function. class i is patients with a weakened heart but without limitation or symptoms. class ii is only limitation at heavier workloads. class iii is limitation at everyday activity. class iv is severe symptoms at rest or with any degree of effort. the prognosis of heart failure patients is very closely associated with the functional class. an important issue in congestive heart failure is the risk of heart rhythm disturbances (arrhythmias). of those deaths that occur in individuals with congestive heart failure approximately % are related to progressive heart failure. importantly the other half are thought to be related to serious arrhythmias. a major advance has been the finding that nonsurgical placement of automatic implantable cardioverter/defibrillators (aicd) in individuals with severe congestive heart failure (defined by an ejection fraction below %-%) can significantly improve survival and has become the standard of care in most such individuals. in some people with severe heart failure and certain ecg abnormalities the left and right side of the heart don't beat in rhythm and inserting a device called a biventricular pacer can significantly reduce symptoms.
a sedentary (inactive) lifestyle is one of the top risk factors for heart disease. fortunately it's a risk factor that you can do something about. regular exercise especially aerobic exercise has many benefits. it can: strengthen your heart and cardiovascular system. improve your circulation and help your body use oxygen better. improve your heart failure symptoms. increase energy levels so you can do more activities without becoming tired or short of breath. increase endurance. lower blood pressure. improve muscle tone and strength. improve balance and joint flexibility. strengthen bones. help reduce body fat and help you reach a healthy weight. help reduce stress tension anxiety and depression. boost self-image and self-esteem. improve sleep. make you feel more relaxed and rested. make you look fit and feel healthy.
well there are numerous places to start with this question such as the obvious: age physical conditioning such as weight cardiovascular strength diet (the usual culprit along with physical conditioning) any known ailments that may contribute to this iron levels sugar levels (which are likely from diet and conditioning lack of vitamins and nutrients) amount of sleep then you can get into much more serious conditions. the first place to start though are those basic questions. if you are over weight do not exercise enogh do not get enough sleep eat a poor diet==well your problem can be easily solved with a little self discipline and un-lazyness. if you are good with al lthese basic things. well. duh. go see yoru doctor. which is always the best and first thing to consider anyways.
"i found out in an ultrasound to check for endometriosis that i had a ""flopped back"" uterus or a backwards tilting uterus. i asked her the same question and she said i should be just fine. she said there have been some people that have had a bit of trouble but if that's the case they recommend a pillow under the hips and laying that way after he ejaculates for - minutes. you may want to check with your doctor as well as they all have different opinions but this is what i was told. good luck."
auto immune disorders are more likely along with impaired renal functions. get thyroid and kidney function tests done. consult a nephrologist
many factors are responsible to trigger migraine. eye irritation itself alone cannot be considered to cause migraine and vice-a-versa. other factors like air pressure changes hot sun or bright or flashing lights can trigger migraine attacks.
"i'm sorry to hear about your accident. ouch! i certainly would suggest you get this checked out. it sounds like you might have a concussion. concussions can vary from mild to severe. if you're having pain around one eye my concern would be that you damaged some of the delicate structures around your eye socket. that definitely deserves to be checked by a medical professional as well as getting an assessment of your head injury in general. because this happened over a week ago i don't necessarily think you need to go to an emergency room. i'd suggest phoning your primary care provider and explaining the situation so they work you in as soon as possible. if they can't get you in within a day or two then i guess i'd suggest you head for an urgent care. i mean on the one hand this doesn't sound like an ""emergency"" anymore but on the other hand it probably needs to get checked out sooner rather than later. just for future reference if you ever hit your head hard enough to black out even for a moment or if you experience dizziness fuzzy memory nausea or any of the other signs of a traumatic brain injury you should go to the emergency room. i wish you all the best and hope you feel better soon!"
benzodiazepines like lorazepam can be addictive. so it is very important to use them only as directed. never take one if you do not have anxiety and never take more than your prescribed dosage.
unfortunately it's impossible to tell what the problem might be without a physical examination. difficulty urinating is not a symptom to be taken lightly. it could be caused by a urinary tract infection kidney infection or even a stone. any of these conditions could cause additional problems if not treated. the difficulty urinating also could contribute to the nausea and vomiting. if these symptoms don't clear up quickly i'd suggest you seek immediate medical treatment. hope this helps!
a pap smear can cause bleeding. the cervix of some women are very friable and will bleed easily from the slightest trauma. a past sexual assault would not be a factor.
we've been dealing with the same thing with my daughter for  months-- she required oral clindamyacin and ciprodex drops to get any relief b/c her staph infection turned out to be mrsa. its been a very expensive nightmare. we also did a day in the or for the doc to irrigate the ear canal and check for polyps. <link> <link> <link>

zyrtec an antihistamine is compatible with antibiotics. the only side effects you my experience would be to them individually.
you are correct in suspecting that the paxil is no longer working at controlling your conditions. many of the ssri's including zoloft and prozac have the same quality of no longer working after a period of therapeutic symptom improvement. after several years of reliable benefit these ssri's may even begin to heighten the anxiety symptoms. i would not recommend taking abilify. it has been shown to have many serious side-effects including affecting blood sugar results. while i understand that you do not want to give-up on a drug that once was effective it is probably best to try another medicine.
it does not sound like you would qualify for a subsidy for your daughter because she has access to employer sponsored insurance through your employer. even though you are paying alot for her insurance your employer insurance meets the affordability standard under the aca because your employer pays the full cost of employee-only coverage. it doesn't hurt to check with covered california (www. coveredca. com) california's health insurance exchange however because your daughter may be able to find cheaper unsubsidized coverage on the exchange.
well thermage is indeed an fda approved procedure that super heats the skin and specifically the collagen which is one of the main building blocks of skin and theoretically would form new younger and tighter collagen. now that process doesnt take place over night. and so the manufacturer has advised physicians and secondarily patients that they will not see an immediate result. the hoped for result may take  or  or  months to achieve. that process is probably not achieved the success that we had hoped it might. again by observation because the patients have to accept that when they are employing a new technology. we are all learning about it so the first kid on the block may be satisfied and may be disappointed. i think to this point were a little bit disappointed. now that said there havent been any complications. i think most patients consider the significant complication to have hit their wallet because they didnt get much for their money. and its not inexpensive. it can be several thousand dollars because it means a visit in the operating room the doctors time the technical the cost of the technology. so again not harmful but not really delivering the goods. certainly not a substitute for a surgical facelift. and many services technologies kind of position themselves as less invasive less traumatic less expensive less everything quote facelift but the answer is they cant match the proven record of a surgical procedure. its just not possible by having the skin treated by a beam of light to get rid of a saggy chin and jowls and the product of many years of ages and perhaps even some dissipation.
first you should probably see your local board certified dermatologist to understand exactly why your skin is reacting this way. it may be as simple as dry skin due to the winter months. but it may also be something more complex such as a contact dermatitis to certain mouthwashes chewing gums or toothpastes. visit your dermatologist so he/she can see your skin and determine the best treatment.
skin bacteria tend to be the underlying culprit for smelly feet. certain types of shoes especially those that do not breathe well causing the feet to sweat can also contribute to the disagreeable odor.

if your child's bmi percentile is in the healthy zone then congratulations! it sounds like your child is at maybe the ~ percentile for height and a % weight so that might be around the  percentile for bmi. if the trend is good then your child's growth is tracking along a healthy path. children who have  parents with weight issues are at higher risk of obesity that is  times higher than the baseline so you are doing a great job. just like i would counsel parents with a child at the  or  percentiles not to worry likewise feel good about your child being at the - percentile.
"i'm not sure what you mean by ""days without food. "" if she eats absolutely nothing for - days and then finally eats one day that would be problematic. you need to make sure her growth is on track by checking with her pediatrician. if she eats very few foods and tends to gag or choke a lot then have her evaluated by a feeding therapist (speech or ot) to rule out oral motor or sensory issues. this also might be a sign of an eating disorder -- for signs and symptoms see this post. if you suspect an eating disorder get her help right away. if she is young and picks at food for a few days and then eats quite a bit that is more normal especially if growth is on track. the best way to handle this is to provide balanced meals and snacks at regular intervals and make sure she sits for a period of time (- minutes). do not pressure her to eat and let her know she doesn't have to -- but she does have to sit and join everyone at the table. children tend to eat better with a non-pressure approach feeding. pushing children to eat can cause early fullness and less food intake at meals. if there is any doubt take her in to the pediatrician for a double check. good luck!"
hi its a bit hard to pick one out as there may be some little bits you have left out. so here's a list of possible's. searches related to zoonotic diseases in horses and eye problems leptospirosis an infectious bacterial disease that occurs in rodents dogs and other mammals and can be transmitted to humans. rabies a contagious and fatal viral disease of dogs and other mammals that causes madness and convulsions transmissible through the saliva to humans. cryptosporidiosis a parasitic disease caused by cryptosporidium a protozoan parasite in the phylum apicomplexa. it affects the intestines of mammals and is typically an acute short-term infection. . . lyme disease an inflammatory disease characterized at first by a rash headache fever and chills and later by possible arthritis and neurological and cardiac disorders caused by bacteria that are transmitted by ticks. see how you get on. good luck
unfortunately yes. shingles is caused by the herpes virus. the same virus that causes fever blisters/cold sores chicken pox and herpes stomatitis (a herpes infection inside the mouth). i do not know where you have the shingles but if it is an area that is covered by clothing this will help prevent the spread to your baby. you will need to keep your hands very very clean. please call your baby's pediatrician for more patient-specific advice.
if the eel was fumigated maybe that's causing a bit of an issue. honestly your case of the nerves over being forced to eat something is likely to be the main cause of this especially if they are not having diarrhea. or you could have gotten it from some other issue that's happening at the same time. sushi and sashimi have to be prepared under some pretty high standards in most cases i'd trust it more than a regular hamburger.
hi this is the only info the company puts out on how to take there pills. you will take your first pill on the first day of your period or on the first sunday after your period begins. you may need to use back-up birth control such as condoms or a spermicide when you first start using lo loestrin fe. follow your doctor's instructions. now most bc pills come to full strength after  days so if these are the same then your on the ball and should be safe. good luck
most helpful answer a few facts: tetanus is rare but if you got it it is nearly % fatal. tetanus is usually not caused by surface wounds but deeper tissue wounds. tetanus vaccine is % protective for  years -- a small price to pay for this type of insurance. i am pleased that you cleaned the wound carefully since tetanus shots do not prevent wound infections. although i cannot see if your finger needed stitches or not if it is over  hours it cannot be sutured. it will need to heal from the inside out. you need to use an antibacterial ointment or cream and observe for signs of infection (redness pus increased tenderness swelling) and see your medical provider if this happens. i vote for the tetanus shot. if it doesn't help you for this wound it least it will help you over the next ten years. your pharmacist may be able to give it to you if this service is provided there. if you decide not to get it that would need to be your decision.

as you have guessed poison ivy can easily be managed at home as long as you don't develop an infection. if it would make you more comfortable it would be appropriate to cover the worst areas with clean dry bandages. just be sure to change them frequently as you don't want to leave a dark moist area alone for too long. the best thing to do is to avoid scratching. using over-the-counter hydrocortisone or calamine lotion is helpful oatmeal baths cool compresses and oral antihistamines like benadryl may provide some relief. as long as the liquid that is draining is clear and colorless you're fine. if it appears to be pus please get a medical evaluation.
i don't recommend taking any medications after the expiration date especially if you are self-diagnosing and self-medicating using leftover antibiotics from a previous prescription. liquid amoxicillin should never be used after the brief (ten day) expiration date; capsules and tablet will lose potency.

ultimately she is responsible for her own mental health and life. bipolar doesn't go away ever and she will have to learn to monitor and control herself so that her moods don't run her life. there are -step programs for adult children of alcoholics (and other dysfunction such as perfectionism hyper-religiosity and any kind of abuse). she needs to know that her own out-of-control tendencies (anger indiscriminate sex any addiction including shopping among others) are not acceptable behaviors (learn to communicate without fighting) and start working on herself. you can be supportive but you can't do the work for her. she is not good mother material so i would avoid even thinking about it until she has proven she can get herself under control. a bipolar person is unstable and instability is not what a child needs to thrive in all ways including emotionally.

thickness and size of eyelashes and eyebrows depend on your genetic inheritance. if your genetic makeup indicates your eyelashes to be thin then they will not grow bigger than your genes allow. in case your genetic material indicates your eyelashes to be thick and beautiful and because of some disease they do not grow well the following steps will help: treat dandruff or any other fungal infection of scalp and skin underlying eyebrows. apply almond oil not refined almond oil (since it has mineral oil mixed with it) but pure almond oil namely badam rogan. it will make your eyebrows grow thicker gradually. consult an ayurveda specialist online for further queries --> <link>

there are many many reasons to have a mild temperature elevation. as a matter of fact dependind on the time of day that you took the temperature a temp of  could be considered a variation of normal. the normal body temperture hovers around  and tends to be a bit higher in the evening; lower in the mornings. fever is usually the body's normal response to fighting of an infection (viruses like colds) or respond to inflammation. while autoimmune disorders can be on this extensive list of reasons for a mild fever it would not be high on the list. you would need to see your medical provider for a thorough medical history some diagnostic tests and a careful examination to determine if an autoimmune disorder was the underlying reason. it is not really necessary to treat a fever especially a mild one with ibuprofen or acetaminophen. remember this is a normal response and fever helps with our immune response. unless you are particularly uncomfortable a fever can be just left alone

doctors can use several types of medicine to treat paget's disease. although it is not possible to cure paget's disease with them they can make the disease inactive and may reduce complications. medicines such as bisphosphonate and calcitonin slow the breakdown and rebuilding of bone tissue. you can use over-the-counter medicines such as acetaminophen nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) or other pain medicines to treat bone pain. medication choices medicines that slow the breakdown and rebuilding of bone tissue include: bisphosphonates which are usually the first medicines used to treat paget's disease. calcitonin which is usually given by injection. your doctor probably will prescribe calcitonin if you cannot tolerate bisphosphonates or if they have not been effective in treating your symptoms. what to think about you may need to take medicine for several weeks before symptoms of paget's disease improve. some medicines control the disease and its symptoms only while the person is taking the medicine. soon after the medicine is stopped symptoms may come back. your doctor may recommend medicine for paget's disease even though you have no symptoms. medicines prevent the rapid breakdown of bone tissue and may decrease the chance of complications of paget's disease. an oral bisphosphonate such as alendronate ( fosamax ) or risedronate ( actonel ) generally is used first. if the side effects are too much for you you can try intravenous pamidronate ( aredia ) or zoledronic acid ( reclast ). webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

it's unlikely insurance companies will lower your rates. you can certainly stay with your current insurer (assuming your plan isn't being discontinued because it doesn't comply with the law) but it's a good idea to shop around to make sure you're signed onto a plan with the best coverage at the best price for you. generally insurers raise rates at the time of renewal so it's reasonable to expect a rate increase once a year.

what should happen? that nurse or medical assistant should be retrained! other than the inflammation which is obvious there should be no long term residuals. i am a bit concerned that you may be having a lymphatic reaction (the red streak) so you medical provider needs to see this and make sure you do not have a secondary infection from this avoidable mistake. don't pay for this extra office visit either. you will still need a proper ppd (and it should be absolutely free! ) and if you need the pneumonia vaccine (administered properly of course) i would insist on a freebee as well.
hi this may be due to hormonal variations. however intra abdominal and thoracic pathologies need to be ruled out. a usg abdomen with a ct chest will help. get complete hemogram and electrolytes checked. thanks
ringworm infection is caused by a fungus. fungi that cause ringworm live and multiply on the upper layer of the skin and on the hair. ringworm is not caused by a worm or other parasite. the medical term for fungal infections is tinea followed by a word that describes the location of infection. for example tinea capitis is ringworm of the scalp and tinea barbae is ringworm of the beard. ringworm of the scalp is most commonly caused by the fungus trichophyton tonsurans which is spread from one person to another. this fungus causes more than  out of  cases of ringworm of the scalp in north and central america.  in the past the fungus microsporum canis was the most common cause but it is a less frequent cause now. microsporum canis is spread by cats and dogs. ringworm of the beard is caused by trichophyton verrucosum and is spread by cattle and other farm animals. you can catch ringworm by sharing contaminated hats combs brushes towels telephones clothing sports equipment or even theater seats and by direct contact with an infected person. children are more susceptible to the fungus and more likely to develop an infection than adults. adults often do not develop an infection even after exposure to ringworm-causing fungi. adults and less commonly children can be carriers for ringworm. carriers can pass ringworm on to others but do not have symptoms of the disease. ringworm-causing fungi can live on people objects (such as hats or brushes) or animals for several months. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.
we spend a lot of time on our feet and the weight of our bodies and the strain of walking can certainly cause inflammation of the tendons or muscles. since you do not recall an injury this may be a strain. nsaids like motrin advil or aleve may help (assuming you can medically take this class of anti-inflammatory medication) along with some hot soaks but if your symptoms persist you will need to consult your medical provider for a proper examination and diagnosis.

most helpful answer just wait. and sweat it out a few more days. while the chance of an unintended pregnancy is not very high you do seem to be aware that the leakage of semen may contain viable baby-causing sperm. something you are trying to prevent. the birth control pill is highly effective. adding the condom makes it even more effective. i suspect your girlfriend will have a normal period and not be pregnant but try and be very very careful. remember that the only % way of preventing pregnancy is abstinence -- not having sex at all.
yeast itches and causes the foreskin to be red and irritated. what you are most likely seeing is smegma -- a normal cheesy-like accumulation that can form under the foreskin. this can even have an unpleasant odor. treatment? retract your foreskin and just wash it off with good ol' soap and and water.

"although the coronary arteries are wide open at birth the atherosclerosis process begins early in life. between the ages of  and  ""fatty streaks"" are already being deposited on the inner lining of the coronary arteries. over the years some of these fatty streaks grow into larger cholesterol plaques that can protrude into the artery lumen and harden the artery walls. many men and women between the ages of  and  typically are unaware that their coronary arteries are gradually accumulating cholesterol plaques. but by ages  to  many people have developed enough atherosclerosis to put them at risk for coronary heart disease."

hi i recommend immediate urine analysis along with blood electrolytes test and gfr my opinion it is a renal problem good luck
the only way to know for sure you're pregnant is with a pregnancy test. but there are early symptoms of pregnancy that can alert you to the fact that you may be pregnant and should have a test. spotting and cramping. breast changes. fatigue. nausea (morning sickness). missed period. it's important to keep in mind that the symptoms may be caused by other things besides being pregnant. so the fact that you notice some of these symptoms does not necessarily mean you are pregnant. the only way to tell for sure is with a pregnancy test. some women are so attuned to their body and the changes it undergoes with pregnancy that they seem to know from the start they are pregnant. other women though have no suspicion they are pregnant until they miss their first period which is perhaps the most widely recognized early sign of pregnancy.
yes it definitely can. spinal stenosis refers to narrowing of the spinal canal. the spinal canal is a narrow opening within the vertebrae (bones of the spine) that allow the spinal cord to pass through. when the spinal canal becomes narrow it puts pressure on the roots of the nerves that run from the spinal cord to various body parts. in the lumbar spine (which is located in the lower back) the nerves transmit sensation from the legs to the brain. if a nerve in the lumbar spine is pinched it can cause the legs (or a single leg) to transmit pain signals. if you've been diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis your doctor should be able to treat your pain in the short term and suggest some ways to deal with the problem in the long term. i suggest you consult your doctor to find out what your options are. i hope you feel better soon!
"if your grandmother's cough has changed from dry to ""productive"" (that is she is coughing up gunk from her lungs) then i'd suggest you take her back to the doctor. older people are more susceptible to getting pneumonia so you'll want to have a doctor rule that out. if your grandmother is running a fever ( or higher) you should seek immediate medical attention at an urgent care facility or the emergency room. this combination of symptoms could signal an infection -- again like pneumonia. meanwhile try to help your grandmother stay hydrated by encouraging her to drink fluids. good hydration will help keep those secretions thinner and less sticky so she can cough them up more easily. if your grandmother is being treated for high blood pressure or congestive heart failure don't push an extreme amount of fluids. in general several glasses of water a day should be all right though. wishing you both the best!"
i have no way to determine if you have permanent damage (since i can't examine you) but my guess would be that your body will heal. when? there is really no way to guess when this might happen. i would suggest that you see a urologist if this problem does not self-correct in a few more weeks of rest (not endurance cycling). it is okay to use it.

the feelings associated with lupus can have multiple causes including: outward effects of the disease or its treatment. visible problems such as a facial rash or weight gain from corticosteroids used to treat lupus can affect your physical appearance and self-esteem. work and activity limitations. pain fatigue and other symptoms can make it difficult to do things you once enjoyed. the disease or its treatment may make it necessary to cut back at work or even leave your job completely. this can affect the pleasure you get from your job your sense of purpose and even your income. pain fatigue and other physical symptoms. simply living with pain and other symptoms every day can wear you down. emotionally this can lead to frustration and feelings of hopelessness. social isolation. when you feel bad or use all of your energy just to get through the day social activities may be among the first things to go. concerns about changes in your appearance may also cause you to withdraw. uncertainty about the future. having a chronic unpredictable disease can cause uncertainty and anxiety. you may wonder how the disease will progress whether you will be able to stay independent or how you will manage physically and financially. difficulty with family relationships. having a chronic illness like lupus may make it difficult to take care of your home or family the way you would like to or feel you should. because the disease may come and go and often shows no outward signs your family may not understand why you cant do the things you used to do. they may even question whether your disease is all in your head.

hi wait until you have missed your next period then do a test then or get your doctor to do one for you. good luck
i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. girl problems can be very annoying! have you actually had your yeast infection diagnosed by a medical professional? as i'm sure you know many conditions can produce symptoms that feel and look like a yeast infection. for example bacterial vaginosis comes to mind -- and that conditions requires treatment with antibiotics. sexually transmitted infections also can mimic symptoms of a vaginal yeast infection. so it's important for you to get a definitive diagnosis before you try any interventions. if in fact you are experiencing a yeast infection then there are many over-the-counter treatments for it as well as a prescription oral medication. you can try any of those. you also can try these tips for avoiding a vaginal yeast infection: don't douche. this can disrupt the balance of natural bacteria inside the vagina. let your crotch breathe. don't wear garments that restrict air flow to your nether regions. perpetual dampness of the vulvar area can promote an overgrowth of yeast. don't sleep in your underwear. when you have a bowel movement always wipe from front to back. a common cause of both utis and yeast infections is contamination by fecal material due to poor hygiene techniques. in other words if you transfer poop toward your vagina and urethra it can cause infections. don't allow your sex partner to insert anything in your anus and then insert it in your vagina. again this can transfer fecal matter to an area where it causes problems. eat products (like certain yogurts) that contain live acidophilus cultures or take an acidophilus supplement. this may help both your gut and your vagina maintain a proper balance of flora (bacteria) for good health. get your blood sugar levels checked. chronic vaginal yeast infections may be a sign of undiagnosed diabetes or pre-diabetes. by the way did you get your uti properly diagnosed? only antibiotics can clear up a urinary tract infection. the studies remain cloudy regarding whether cranberry actually helps the symptoms a uti or not but it certainly won't cure one. wishing you well!
"yes. you have to take statins for life. life style changes are necessary but dont solve your cholesterol problem. there seems to be mystery behind the cholesterol theory of artery blockages. i believe statiins reduce inflammation of coronary arteries and reduce the chances for cholesterol to stick to artery walls. that statins reduce ldl is incidental. web md has not thrown any light on this shady area. i wish they say some thing on the ""cholesterol myth""."

"ridiculous! most of the men and boys on this planet are uncircumcised. just the way god made them. uncircumcised boys do not wet the bed more than circumcised boys and going through this unnecessary and painful procedure for a -year old is not a cure for his bedwetting. the only exception would be if his foreskin was so tight that he is having difficulty urinating and his foreskin is ""ballooning"" from trapped urine when he pees. even then there are ways of fixing a tight foreskin without circumcision. there are medications that can help. assuming you can get them in your country. that can really really help. desmopressin (ddavp) is what i have used for years for bedwetting and in my opinion works like a charm in the vast majority of bedwetters. one major cause of bedwetting is the lack of adh (anti-diuretic hormone). a hormone that reduces the amount of urine that is produced at night. if a young boy does not have enough of this natural hormone the body will continue to produce urine at the same rate is day-time. not something that is desirable. desmopressin replaces this hormone. clearly his doctor is suggesting a surgery and i absolutely do not agree with this unorthodox approach. consider seeing a child endocrinologist. even if you have to travel to a larger city or at least suggest desmopressin as a non-surgical approach. your son needs help. bedwetting is embarrassing and it is not his fault."
this is a class effect and it's really important that patients understand that they need to use one pharmacy get to know their pharmacist on a first name basis and have a medication list which lists all of their medications that they are taking; both over-the-counter herbals vitamins as well as prescriptions. this class can interact with certain antibiotics it can interact with certain blood thinners so it's going to be really important that we know all the other medicines that people are taking. nowadays a lot of people don't use just one pharmacy. so help out the pharmacist we are looking out for your safety. if a drug interaction is possible if the pharmacy can get a hold of it quickly like basically know what other meds you are on intercept it and then call the doctor we can get you switched to something that won't interact and therefore you will be okay. so once again it's that essential communication that information that we need to help the pharmacist do our jobs so we can help you.

at four months of age many babies will start to laugh and squeal adding to the happiness of your day. their hands tend to be more open (and less fisted) so they will be interested in reaching for objects and may try to bring it to their mouths. if they get enough tummy time you should expect to see your  month old attempt to roll from front to back. at  months babies are much more social and you will notice that they are generally happier when they are upright and can see what is going on. you may notice that feedings take longer if there are a lot of distractions like older brothers and sisters playing in the same room. .

exercise is a great way to deal with anxiety issues! when i was in college i was diagnosed with anxiety issues and my therapist suggested that i start taking daily walks. they helped me not only have time each day to clear my head and calm my anxiety but also helped me discover the joys of walking as a form of exercise. i'm not sure what your comments about the ribs mean but if you are concerned about it you should see a doctor or go to student health for free.
i would not recommend it. i believe that it would irritate you more because you are actually sitting in whatever bacteria or dirt that you may have on you. it is also better to use soaps or shower gels that are fragrance free. hope this helps
while excess weight doesn't necessarily cause arthritis in places like your feet it can exacerbate it or make it progress in a more rapid fashion. excess weight puts additional stress on joints making arthritis symptoms worse. losing weight will not cure arthritis but it can help slow down the progression of the disease. for more details on how this works see this webmd article. weight bearing joints like knee and ankle are most likely affected by arthritis. being overweight is a known risk factor of arthritis and even putting on  pounds may worsen the arthritis. while treating arthritis in obese and overweight individuals weight loss is considered as an important strategy.
i'm sorry you're going through this and hope you feel better soon. i strongly advise you see your primary care provider as soon as possible to diagnose what is going on. it could simply be that you're young and working a lot and don't have time to eat. or it could be a symptom of a larger condition that needs to be treated. unfortunately it's impossible to diagnose something like this from the internet. you need a physical exam and possibly some blood work to find out what's going on. you deserve to be treated if appropriate and live a full life. age  should be the prime of your life! i hope this helps.

it is often recommended to limit a newborn's exposure to potential infection during the first  -  weeks of life. for this reason alone it may be best to wait until your baby is - weeks old. waiting until after a month not only reduces some of the concerns asociated with exposure to infection but nursing may be better established as will the baby's routine. i have read that airlines will not allow a baby to fly that is less than  week old. i have also read some health care professionals say that babies as young as  weeks old can fly if needed. however since women are at increased risk for blood clots following delivery it may be best to wait a little while longer than  or  weeks for both mother's health and the baby's health. bottom line: if there is a compelling need to fly with your baby it can be done very early but you are likely best off waiting for at least  -  weeks. you should confer with your pediatrician for advice and check with your airline for their regulations as well.
hi rose doing some reading your blood test for allergys did you get a reading for cholesterol? i wonder if eggs are spiking your cholesterol its just a thought but well worth looking into it could also be something to do with being black there some other things that affects black people and people from the mediterranean countries. so peanuts read this it may help you it sounds very much like you. an allergic reaction occurs when your immune system sees a normally harmless substance as foreign and attacks it. in addition to the common symptoms associated with allergies -- such as itching hives a runny nose and sneezing -- food allergies can also cause intestinal problems. common digestion-related symptoms that stem from food allergies include nausea cramping diarrhea bloating and vomiting. severe symptoms of a food allergy can include chest pain shortness of breath and throat constriction. peanuts and tree nuts such as almonds and pecans are one of the most common causes of allergic reactions according to the american academy of allergy asthma & immunology. do hope this helps you. good luck

when it comes to any medication -- over the counter or prescription -- you need to call your obstetrician's office for patient-specific advice and recommendations. i can assure you that they have had this question before. while many ob's have prescribed codeine-containing cough suppressants others will not use them. honey is a good cough suppressant too. and considered safe if store-bought and purified. the real question might be the underlying reason for your cough. that maybe something you should investigate before treating it.
maybe. if she is well into puberty (breast development pubic hair etc. ) but certainly there are other causes. accidental straddle-type injuries can cause vaginal or hymen tears. some virginal hymens are nearly imperforate (little or no opening) and an injury could have caused a rupture. this sensitive area is rich in blood supply so bleeding can be concerning. it may be wise to have her examined by her medical provider (hopefully someone who is sensitive and caring and will not cause her undue embarrassment). ask her about possible injuries and sadly ask if anyone has touched her inappropriately. most of the time however these sudden bleeding episodes are trauma but if they occur again in a cycle. this could have been her first period.

"while it's commonly called the ""stomach flu "" viral gastroenteritis has nothing to do with the actual flu. cramps diarrhea and vomiting are the hallmarks of highly contagious gastroenteritis which gains notoriety when it tears through cruise ships conventions etc. symptoms appear one or two days after exposure to the virus which is carried in the stool of an infected person. failure to wash hands after using the bathroom and before handling food or touching surfaces spreads contamination. several types of viruses are the culprits and they tend to target certain age groups. adults are most vulnerable to the norwalk variety. children are more commonly affected by the rotavirus. but remember anyone can catch it so wash your hands."
yes anti seizure drugs commonly cause headaches hair loss and over relaxed muscles (weakness). this indicates a need to change the dose or the drug itself. your doctor can figure the cause of your seizures depending on history. sometimes no cause can be there. this is called idiopathic seizures. they are usually seen in young adults but can occur at any age. there may be a family history of epilepsy or seizures. if seizures continue repeatedly after the underlying problem is treated the condition is epilepsy.

here are some common early signs of pregnancy. it's important to keep in mind that the symptoms may be caused by other things besides being pregnant. so the fact that you notice some of these symptoms does not necessarily mean you are pregnant. the only way to tell for sure is with a pregnancy test. spotting and cramping. breast changes. fatigue. nausea (morning sickness). missed period.
hi as with any illness in pregnancy if you have symptoms you should consult your doctor. your doctor will need to confirm the diagnosis with a lab test. while there is usually no threat to the baby the doctor will want to monitor your condition. your fever will need to be controlled since an extremely high fever can be dangerous to the baby. there is no cure for mono. treatment includes rest managing the fever and preventing dehydration. this is important especially during pregnancy. it is normal to experience a decrease in your appetite when you are sick but its important to be sure your baby is getting the nutrients and fluids he needs. do hope this helps you. good luck
common area? no but herpes zoster (shingles) follows a nerve pathway so this painful infection can occur in this area. hopefully your doctor prescribed the appropriate anti-herpetic viral medications for you. these are quite helpfu. pain medication is also important since this can last a while longer. how long? it would not be possible to make an accurate prediction since this is really up to your immune system but i would expect that you would be considerably improved in a week (if you had the antiviral medication). the fever headache and flu-like symptoms are typical of shingles so hang in there.
no matter which part of the skin is affected eczema is almost always itchy. sometimes the itching will start before the rash appears but when it does  the rash most commonly occurs on the face knees hands or feet. it may also affect other areas as well. affected areas usually appear very dry thickened or scaly. in fair-skinned people these areas may initially appear reddish and then turn brown. among darker-skinned people eczema can affect pigmentation making the affected area lighter or darker. in infants the itchy rash can produce an oozing crusting condition that occurs mainly on the face and scalp but patches may appear anywhere.
it may just be an innocent skin tag (quite common) but unfortunately this would require an examination to confirm. a description is really not sufficient to make a blind diagnosis. next time ask your medical professional during an examination in this area.
your first goal is to determine if there underlying reasons for your habit. potential issues can range from an obsessive compulsive disorder to stress. severe nail biting can lead to serious health risks. bacteria can be transferred from your hands to your mouth. i would suggest that you consider an evaluation with a qualified psychotherapist and if there are secondary medical problems from the biting (such as an infection) your dermatologist can treat them. often a team approach can be effective for complex issues. i had the same problem until my late 's. a friend invited me to a nail salon & i had the acrylic nails put on for fun. i actually tried to bite & pick at those too! every month or so i would go back & have my nails touched up. as time went by i noticed that i had stopped biting my nails. i still get manicures but i stopped getting the acrylic nails. it has been at least  years now since i have stopped bitting my nails.

gallbladder problems have become increasingly common due in part to our fattier diets. i hope you're not suffering from any gallbladder issues! the gallbladder is a small sac located near the liver. its job is to produce bile that helps break down any fats we eat. usually the gallbladder functions flawlessly throughout the course of our life. sometimes however stones build up and block the passage of bile out of the gallbladder. that's when the fun begins. the symptoms of a gallbladder attack (gallstones) can include: pain in your stomach pain in the upper-right part of your abdomen pain that radiates from the upper-right part of the abdomen to the shoulder or upper back yellowing of the skin or the whites of the eyes fever and chills not everyone will experience all of these symptoms. also pain from a gallbladder attack can range from mild to severe. everyone's case is different. if you're experiencing a fever chills and yellowing of the whites of your eyes or skin you should seek immediate medical attention. if your symptoms are less severe schedule an appointment with your primary care provider to discuss testing that can be done to assess whether or not you're having a problem with gallstones. i wish you all the best! i was told i had sludge now it is a constant pain in my upper right side under my rib. it is happening more often now and last a few minutes to half an hr.

"since you message is two hours old now (webmd answers is not an emergency response service! ) i suspect the bleeding has stopped by now. in most cases these avulsion-type cuts will bleed quite freely but steady pressure/compression on the wound (without peeking! ) for at least ten minutes or so should suffice. compression and time will allow these tiny severed blood vessels to close. once the bleeding has stopped you can inspect your wound to see if suturing is requiried. if so you have have an  hour or so ""window"" to have this done. if the flap of skin has been completely severed and the wound is small it should heal and new skin will cover the area. if the flap is hanging on and is pink (means it has a viable blood supply) allow this piece to cover the wound and it may re-graft. obviously without seeing it it is difficult to offer you patient-specific advice."

i need a few answers from you before deciding on the reasons for heaviness or itching. can you please give the details for the following questions? are you on anti-glaucoma medication? if so can you name them? when was the last eye examination done what was the eye pressure? what is the grade of glaucoma? itching can be because of specific anti-glaucoma medications. i need to know the eye pressure to decide whether your current heaviness is due to the anti-glaucoma medications. this is to decide whether we need to change or continue the medication or decide on any other modalities of eye pressure control in relation to the severity of glaucoma. revert back with the details to an eye care ophthalmologist online --> <link>
eggs have been in the news a lot recently and for once it isnt the cholesterol that is making people fearful over eggs. this time its salmonella enteriditis which appears to be able to infect the ovaries of chickens and can cause their eggs (usually the egg white) to be contaminated from the inside out. the eggs in question have been traced to a couple of high-volume egg producers in iowa. but this outbreak aside keep in mind that there are over   egg-related salmonella illnesses each year in the u. s. according to fda estimates. most salmonella cases dont require a doctor visit and can resolve in one to three days according to the fda but its the  percent of cases that are severe require hospitalization and are cause for great concern. i dont know about you but i dont even want to experience the one to three-day salmonella poisoning. there is some hope that there will be a lower risk of salmonella from eggs in the future. new fda regulations which went into effect in july this year are expected to cut the number of salmonella-carrying eggs by  percent. egg-laying hens are thought to get salmonella from a couple different ways and it aint pretty thats for sure — through germs carried by flies and from eating the excrement of rodents that get into their feed. i personally am not afraid to use and enjoy eggs in my recipes and meals. i just automatically cook my eggs completely. i also use half eggs and half pasteurized egg substitute or egg white when making egg-based entrees to bring down the saturated fat and cholesterol. and i try to purchase cage-free eggs (even better when they are cage-free and higher omega-) for a variety of reasons. what else can you do? * use the eggs you buy within four weeks. * keep eggs refrigerated at least to  at all times. store eggs in their carton in the center of the refrigerator instead of removing them and storing them in the door which may not be cold enough. * to substantially reduce the risk of salmonella do not eat raw eggs and cook your eggs and egg dishes completely (the white and yolk will be firm. ) * wash your hands cooking utensils and food prep surfaces thoroughly after being in contact with eggshells and raw eggs. * dont eat recalled eggs or products containing recalled eggs. * discard cracked or dirty eggs. * dont keep eggs warm or at room temperature for more than two hours. * refrigerate unused or leftover egg-containing foods as soon as possible.

the symptoms you describe can be signs of early pregnancy. i have no way of knowing if this is it or what your gp suggests which is also a possibility. a few days after conception the fertilized egg attaches itself to wall of the uterus. this can cause one of the earliest signs of pregnancy -- spotting and sometimes cramping. that's called implantation bleeding. it occurs anywhere from six to  days after the egg is fertilized. the bleeding and cramps however are slight. here's more information on pregnancy symptoms

my sister recently went to the doctor for a trigger finger. she was told to use a cold compress for  minute intervals for  days. she had already bought an over the counter splint to keep the finger straight the doctor told her to continue using it though i think she only wore it at night. i have always been told that whatever makes you more comfortable heat or cold is what you should use. i cannot tolerate cold it seems to make pain worse. i crushed my leg when i had an accident  years ago and it required a  hour surgery to be put back together with rods plates & screws with several follow up surgeries. while in the hospital the surgeon wanted ice to be put on it but after seeing the pain it caused & the reaction for the cold he changed the treatment to heat which helped more. i would use whatever gives the most relief. i hope your finger feels better soon! my sisters did after a week.

yes it is a possibility that you are pregnant. i personally went through this exactly like yourself i took two home tests and they both had said negative those things aren't always accurate it could be that it's just early in the stages and not getting a good reading but once you've mised your period for more than  days you are more than likely pregnant. you will now need to see a doctor for further testing. once i went to doctor found out and turned out i was  months pregnant. go to doctor!
you have mentioned numbness in your hand finger tips and the area mentioned appears to be that of median nerve region. now if this pain and numbness are severe and persistent then the advice to you is to get nerve conduction study done and look for severity of compression. if compression is severe then the initial trial of the brace can be given. but if there is no improvement then a small surgery in the form of carpal tunnel decompression should be done. also medication for neuropathic symptoms like pregabalin or gabapentin should be initiated along with vitamin  supplementation as it acts as a neuro regenerator. also can you also tell me whether you have any neck pain with pain radiating in upper limbs or any other vascular issue as clinical presentation can also be same in the condition? revert with the details to an orthopaedician and traumatologist online --> <link>
because they don't routinely test men for trichomonas. men tend to pee it out. it can be seen (sometimes) but it is often missed in routine urine tests in women and men. women on the other hand can have trich happily colonized in their vagina or urinary tract for long periods of time. it may have been missed in august. i suspect that both you and your partner have had previous partners so let it go. get it treated and be monogamous from now on and you will both be fine.

"it is not likely that a week after a minor injury that this ""little wound"" would still be open and viable to secondary bacterial contamination resulting in an infection. you did the right thing by washing your hands so just watch for any signs of infection (redness tenderness swelling etc. ) and see your medical provider should this happen."

hi if you have had your diagnosis confirmed on an knee mri and if the acl tear is complete then surgery is the only option. incomplete acl tears and lcl tears can be treated by plaster splints and immobilisation to some extent. but if are a soccer player. its better you get it operated so that you can continue playing it in future. if you neglect this tear then you wont be able to play soccer ever as the knee will be irreversably damaged. so  thing u do now is get operated. thanks
the flu shot contains inactivated virus not live virus. this should not cause any flu symptoms and is not going to make you contagious. the nasal flu vaccine contains weak live virus but is considered safe for healthy people that are not pregnant between the ages of -. hope this is helpful. talk to your doctor if you are concerned or have more questions.
persistent fluid in the ears. longer than three months. may be an indication for tubes since this can interfere with hearing predispose to frequent middle ear infection and delay speech development. please follow up with the ent on a regular basis to monitor this stagnant fluid and make sure your son appears to be hearing normally (turning toward your voice or sounds etc. ).

when the brain does not get enough blood supply it begins to shut down. symptoms include: lightheadedness. confusion. nausea. fainting or passing out. there may also be weakness blurred vision and shaking or tremulousness. these symptoms may resolve quickly as the body slowly adjusts to the standing position but in some cases the patient has to sit or lie down quickly to prevent passing out or falling.
i'm sorry that i really can't give you an answer to this because i'm not sure what type of test result you're referring to. however as with any test the best person to consult about the results is the health care provider who ordered the test. a person's individual medical history plays such a key role in interpreting test results that it's dicey to try doing it in a forum like this one. what's normal for one person with one health history may be abnormal for another person with a different health history. if your health care provider can't explain the test results in an understandable way don't hesitate to tell them so. you have a right to understand the test results so keep asking questions until you're satisfied you grasp what's going on. take care!

if the shingles are not in a place where there would be direct skin contact (covered by clothing) you can go back to work when you can tolerate or control the pain. as a pre-school employee you most likely were exposed to the varicella (chicken pox) virus by one of the children (unless you have had shingles in the past and this is just a reactivation of the virus).
"the simple answer to this is: if both you and your fiance are fertile and you have unprotected sex then there's always a chance of pregnancy. true you're more likely to get pregnant at certain times during your menstrual cycle specifically during the "" fertile window "" that occurs during and after ovulation. but ovulation is a tricky thing to predict. oddly enough the ovaries don't consult a calendar before releasing an egg. so even a woman with a very regular cycle could get pregnant outside her fertile window period. the only way to know for sure is to take a pregnancy test. depending on the test you choose you may be able to find out as quickly as one day after a missed period. read the kit's box and follow the instructions to the letter to get an accurate reading. for best results test your urine first thing in the morning when hormones will be most concentrated in it. whichever way you're hoping i wish you all the best!"
not enough information. mainly the kind of iud that you had (some are hormonal). this question can easily be answered by the medical professional that removed your iud. someone that knows you your medical history and someone that knows these missing pieces. as much as i would like to help it would not be appropriate to just guess. a simple phone call to your medical office should be all that you need.
hi such symptoms occur due to hormonal changes in your body that commonly result out of stress. you need to de-stress yourself by yoga meditation and doing things that you love doing. fever headaches and dizziness can also be caused due to pelvic inflammation. you can get a usg abdomen done to see if anythings wrong. otherwise there is nothing to worry. you will be fine in a few days. thanks
cervical cancer may have an underlying cause such as hpv (human papilloma virus) but i would have no idea if this man also has hpv. herpes is an entirely different type of infection that does not cause cervical cancer but can be transmitted to you during sex. a condom would offer a reasonable (but not %) protection against herpes. there are different strains of hpv. some of them cause cervical cancer and some of them cause genital warts. if his wife's cervical cancer was caused by hpv (most cases are) then he most certainly had or has a serious form of hpv. the herpes diagnosis is a completely separate issue. please keep in mind that hpv (and maybe herpes but i don't know about that) can be spread by contact with areas that are not covered by a condom. it can also be spread by oral or anal sex.
the cdc estimates that .  million people in the u. s have chronic hepatitis c infection a long-term illness that happens when the virus remains in a person's body. most of those people don't know that they have it because they don't look or feel sick. an estimated   people in the us have acute hepatitis c infection which is a short-term illness that happens within six months of being exposed to the hepatitis c virus.
osteoarthritis is by far the most common type of arthritis and the percentage of people who have it grows higher with age. an estimated .  percent of the u. s. population (nearly  million americans) age  and older have osteoarthritis. although osteoarthritis is more common in older people younger people can develop it – usually as the result of a joint injury a joint malformation or a genetic defect in joint cartilage. both men and women have the disease. before age  more men than women have osteoarthritis; after age  it is more common in women. it is also more likely to occur in people who are overweight and in those with jobs that stress particular joints. as the population ages the number of people with osteoarthritis will only grow. by   percent of americans – about  million people – will have passed their  birthday and will be at high risk for the disease.
the dosage of acyclovir in milk after valacyclovir is less than % of a typical infant dosage and would not be expected to cause any adverse effects in breastfed infants. no special precautions are required when using valacyclovir during breastfeeding. in one study administration of valacyclovir to mothers with concurrent herpes simplex type  and hiv infections reduced breastmilk shedding of the hiv virus in breastmilk at  and  weeks postpartum but not later. so no need to worry about it
mine went away when the podiatrist told me to wear different shoes. yes the possibility always exists for it to come back depending on the aggravating circumstances.
a tiny amount of blood would not be a cause for alarm. the skin lining of the ear canal is rich in blood supply so you most likely irritated it when you used the q-tip. it is best to never use q-tips inside the ear canal. one of reasons water had a difficult time coming out of ears is because you do not have a adequate protective coating of (ear) wax. when water meets a waxy surface it will just bead up and fall out by gravity but if you do not have a waxy surface the water will remain.
i can understand your concern. whenever a person reaches a mature age we start to wonder if confusion could be a sign of alzheimer's or dementia. i hope to set your mind at ease. confusion in elderly people can result from many causes and one of those certainly is low blood pressure and/or a low heart rate. think of it this way: if the heart is beating so slowly it can't push an adequate volume of oxygen-rich blood to the brain then the brain isn't going to function at top efficiency. i hope you'll find the reduction in the valsartin dose will get that pressure up and solve the confusion problem. confusion also can be a sign of a urinary tract infection (uti). usually we think uti in relation to delirium (which is like confusion on steroids) but sudden confusion that doesn't clear up also could be an indicator of a uti. confusion also can result from pain malnutrition poor vision poor hearing and many other things. if your husband's confusion doesn't improve with the medication change or if it gets progressively worse you might consider taking him to his primary care provider and very frankly stating your concerns. an initial evaluation for dementia can be done quickly right in the exam room and ruling it out can provide significant peace of mind for everyone. wishing you well!
the five recommendations: children should ride in a rear-facing child safety seat at least until age two or until theyre too big for the maximum size of their seat. all children two years or older (or younger than two if theyve outgrown their backwards-facing seat) should use a forward-facing seat with a harness for as long as possible. this would typically be around age four. children should then use a belt-positioning booster seat until theyve outgrown it typically between age - and around '? . when children are big enough to use a seat belt alone they should always use a lap-and-shoulder belt. all children less than  years should always be seated in the rear seat of the vehicle. the new guidelines can be simplified to: stay in the current seat until your child has definitely outgrown it according to the manufacturers specifications. dont rush into the next seat.
you need to get this checked out by a medical professional as soon as possible. the symptoms you describe could be due to an infection or a blood clot and both of these need to be treated quickly. either call your doctor's office and explain to them what's going on so they can get you an appointment soon or go to an urgent care facility. i'm hoping the underlying cause of your symptoms is nothing serious but please don't delay getting this checked out. all the best to you!
how does your neck feel? are you having much pain at all? are you taking anything for pain? were you doing the running and using your treadmill and cross trainer before the surgery? did your doctor tell you specifically not to do any running or using the treadmill or cross trainer? i had my surgery in nov.  and i had to have some heat therapy on my neck about  months after my surgery. i could not move my neck to one side so it may it hard to drive cause of me turning my neck. but the heat therapy really help me. i found it so relaxing that i went to sleep. if you are not on any pain medications and you are healthy i would start running say close by to your house in case you have any problems and if you use the treadmill and cross trainer do it in moderation. start say with  minutes then see how you feel and then maybe do another  minutes just don't over do it. there is always another day where you can start slow and then wait say about a month before i would just jump in. don't cram  months of exercise in one week. do it in moderation. . let me know how you are doing. i do hope that it all goes well for you. i would like to know how you are doing. please keep us informed of how well you are doing. thank you.
first u need to do stool and urine analysiswhy are u on antibiotic?
this is a good question that you can always ask your pharmacist. yes you can take ibuprofen while taking tamiflu.
"i am not a big fan of juice for babies (unless they are having problems with true constipation). when they start eating solids well you can give a little ""pure"" juice (not sugar-water flavored). fruit is better after about age six months. most of the time they do not need more water than what they are getting in breast milk or formula. if is hot outside it's okay to give a little water. it won't hurt them but you don't want them to fill up their little tummies with water to the point where they won't take nourishment."
it could very well be related or have other causes
"that is silly advice but you do have a / chance of having a boy (or girl) no matter when you have sex. every day or every other day. chromosomes are inside the sperm and egg. the ""y"" doesn't really attach to anything. the fastest sperm is often the one that impregnates you so if you want a boy all you can do is hope that the sperm swims like michael phelps. there are many old wive's tales about techniques to improve your chances of having a boy or girl but in the end those techniques are no better than a coin toss. if you get what you want you will praise the method you used. if you don't you will not recommend it to anyone. so let nature make the decision for you and don't stress out about the sex of a baby that has not been conceived yet. just hope for a happy healthy baby."
there are excellent chemical peels or laser peels your dermatologist can offer you to help treat this very sensitive area. my preference is the fractional  laser.
i am sorry for the illness of your brother-in-law. i do not know his medical history and i am not a doctor but ill try to provide you with some information as follows: the symptoms as you describe can occur at any stage of liver disease. but a diagnosis for the condition is not usually made until acute liver failure occurs. sometimes the symptoms appear even when liver disease has not been diagnosed; the condition is called hepatic encephalopathy. because the liver is damaged and cannot adequately remove toxins from the bloodstream the toxins build-up in the body causing confusion fatigue and sometimes hallucinations. hepatic encephalopathy can lead to mental deterioration personality changes coma and even death. but hepatic encephalopathy may also be reversible through treatments directed at removing the toxins and eliminating protein from the diet; patients with hepatic encephalopathy may experience delusions hallucinations or illusions. a delusion is a wrong fixed idea such as. im the king of england.  a hallucination occurs when a person perceives something through the senses where there is no actual stimulus. an example of a hallucination might be seeing rats running down a blank wall. an illusion is a sense oriented defect in which a stimulus is present but incorrectly identified by one of the senses. an example of an illusion might be seeing a crack in a wall and believing that it actually a trail of rats. summary: many times there are no overt symptoms of liver disease during the early stages of liver disease including cirrhosis. it is suspected that your brother-in-law may be in a more advanced stage of liver disease. your brother-in-law appears to be in an acute stage of liver disease that has resulted in toxin build-up within the body causing stage  hepatic encephalopathy. hepatic encephalopathy patients may have a reversal of this condition with efficient and timely medical treatment. unfortunately some hepatic encephalopathy patients do not respond to treatment and death may occur. i hope that this answer has been helpful and that you and your family remain well during this period of medical uncertainty.
hi yes it could be? but its very hard to say just on a symptom. the best place would be to see his own doctor or uro there are other avenues to go down first before coming to cancer. do hope this helps. good luck
the life span of sperm after ejaculation depends on the circumstances. sperm ejaculated into a woman's vagina can live in a woman's cervical mucus or upper genital tract for three to five days. fertilization is possible as long as the sperm remain alive. so it is possible that u may get pregnant
i would say yes. although i am not a dancer i have seen the high level of aerobic activity associated with zumba. any exercise is good if you enjoy it and get cardiovascular benefits as well so this would be an excellent choice. as a word of caution if you have any medical problems that may be problematic it would be wise to get a specific okay from your medical provider before starting any exercise program. yes. any kind of exercise is useful to burnout calories and stay active. you have to keep a proper chart of total workout for every day if you are including to many types of exercise techniques.
you need to work with a healthcare provider on this issue and have your levels monitored. they also might have specific treatment for you. if you eat fish and seafood less often your levels will likely go down but you need to work with someone and have levels tested to be sure. for more on the topic read this q&a with the doctor of a well-known actor who had mercury toxicity from eating sushi twice a day for years.
hi long standing cough should not be neglected. first thing you should do is get a xray chest done and consult a chest physician. breathing exercises and if necessary antibiotics should be started. thanks
there are many types of kidney disease so unfortunately i don't really have any information about your kidney issues in order to be able to comment. my suggestion is for you to consult your nephrologist or primary care medical provider first -- someone who knows your medical history. epsom salt deprivation chambers are likely to be just fine and you are correct. you will not absorb anything through your skin. you certainly will not be drinking it!
"i think you'll probably be in the clear. for most occasional smokers nicotine is cleared from the system within - days. for people who smoke regularly or who are exposed regularly to secondhand smoke nicotine can be detected in urine for up to about  days after the last exposure. if you're smoking one cigar a month i wouldn't consider you to be in the ""regular"" smoker category. that is unless you make that cigar last for days or weeks in a row! but assuming you're having one nice evening a month with a cigar you should probably pass your urine test. i know i should be discouraging you from smoking in any way shape or form but i find it pretty hard to chastise someone who simply wants to enjoy a cigar once in awhile. so let me just say that all inhalation of tobacco smoke (even if you just pull it into your mouth) has the potential to cause cancer. be sure to receive regular oral exams to make sure you're not developing any suspicious lesions from your habit. take care!"
an mrsa infection isn't classified as a sexually transmitted disease. yet mrsa can be transmitted by direct skin contact. skin to skin contact especially if your skin has an abrasion or cut can increase the risks of getting an mrsa infection from your girlfriend. in general my advice is to avoid direct contact with anyone that has an mrsa infection and avoid sharing personal items.
there are many types of hair loss also called alopecia: gradual thinning of hair with age is a natural condition known as involutional alopecia. more and more hair follicles go into a telogen or resting phase and the remaining hairs become shorter and fewer in number. androgenic alopecia is another form of hair loss. it's a genetically predisposed condition that can affect both men and women. men with this condition can begin suffering hair loss as early as their teens or early  while most women don't experience noticeable thinning until their  or later. in men the condition is also called male pattern baldness. it's characterized by a receding hairline and gradual disappearance of hair from the crown. in women androgenic alopecia is referred to as female pattern baldness. women with the condition experience a general thinning over the entire scalp with the most extensive hair loss at the crown. patchy hair loss in children and young adults often sudden in onset is known as alopecia areata. this condition may result in complete baldness but in about % of cases the hair returns usually within a few years. with alopecia universalis all body hair falls out. tearing out one's own hair a psychological disorder known as trichotillomania is seen most frequently in children. telogen effluvium is hair thinning over the scalp that occurs because of changes in the growth cycle of hair. a large number of hairs enter the resting phase at the same time causing shedding and subsequent thinning.
"be sure baby's nails are trimmed often and then take the edge off of them with a file if you can. some parents also slip ""scratch mittens"" onto their little one's hands. others try long socks tucked in under a long-sleeved shirt so they're harder for baby to remove. other things you can do to treat baby's eczema at home include: bathe baby for no more than  minutes in warm water. hot water can strip skin of its natural protective oils. use mild unscented body and laundry soaps. use soap only where baby may be dirty such as the genitals and hands and feet. simply rinse off the rest of baby's body. pat baby's skin dry; don't rub. apply a moisturizer while baby's skin is wet. oatmeal soaking products added to baby's tub may make your little one's skin less itchy. talk to your doctor."
i can't answer that question since i don't know your symptoms have the ability to examine you or see those test results. i can tell you that about half of the women (i am also assuming you are a female) who have symptoms of a uti do not have them. many will have urethral irritation (usually from sexual activity) or even a vaginal infection. the culture is much more accurate than the rapid urine test so follow your instructions and see your medical provider again if you are not getting better.
"i'm glad you asked. a nutritional supplement is not likely to help with premature ejaculation and there's no scientific evidence any of these ""male enhancement"" products actually help with male sexual performance. what concerns me is the number of these ""all natural"" ""herbal"" supplements that have been found (at least in the u. s. ) to contain actual prescription medications designed to treat erectile dysfunction. the u. s. food and drug administration (fda) has issued several alerts and recalls over the past few years on this type of product (though not vigormax specifically that i know of). the addition of these prescription drugs to over-the-counter dietary supplements is illegal and dangerous. manufacturers do not disclose these drugs on the label. so my advice to you is to seek medical treatment for your premature ejaculation issue and to give the nutritional supplements a pass. some things you can do to help with premature ejaculation: stop smoking drinking or using illicit drugs use a condom to reduce sensation in the penis try different sexual positions to reduce stimulation until ejaculation is desired sometimes doctors will prescribe antidepressant medications to treat premature ejaculation. hope this helps!"
fortunately most children outgrow the itchy irritation of eczema before school age. a small number of kids will have eczema into adulthood. remissions do occur and can last for years though the tendency to have dry skin often lingers.
"there is research that shows that barbecuing can be hazardous to your health. but don't worry there is still a way to have your ""barbecued steak"" and eat it too. the health problem lies in the meat. research has discovered two cancer-causing (carcinogenic) byproducts associated with barbecuing red meat poultry lamb pork and fish. the first is a carcinogen called heterocyclic amines (hcas). the national institute of health department of health and human services included hcas on its reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen list. hcas are formed due to the high temperatures occurring when meat is overcooked or char-grilled. studies have shown that when hcas were fed in the diet rodents developed cancers in many organs including the colon breast and prostate. research is still underway to determine if this applies to humans as well. the second carcinogen associated with barbecuing is polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs). they are formed when fat drips onto the coal or hot surface. the smoke carries the pahs to the food. they can also form directly on the food when it is charred. the recipe for healthy barbecuing is to follow some simple tips: don't get too hot: try to avoid overcooking food by precooking it in the microwave or oven so it won't be on the barbecue as long; keep the heat down on the grill and flip the food frequently to prevent overcooking on one side; buy thinner cuts of meat so that they don't take as long to cook; and test the meat with a thermometer to see when it's ready. the usda recommended safe minimum internal temperatures are: steaks & roasts -  degrees f fish --  degrees f. pork --  degrees f. ground beef --  degrees f. chicken breasts --  degrees f. whole poultry --  degrees f. trim the fat: go for leaner cuts of meat; cut as much fat off of the meat when possible; and flip your food instead of stabbing it with a fork to avoid the fat dripping onto the coal. take time to marinate: some research has shown the ingredients (especially vinegar) in marinades act can actually protect the meat and reduce the chances of carcinogenic compounds forming. one study found that a beef steak marinated with teriyaki sauce had a % and % lower hca level at  minutes than the unmarinated steak and that lower levels of hca were also observed in meat marinated with turmeric-garlic sauce. keep it clean: keep the oil and grease off your grill by turning up the heat to high and closing the lid for about  minutes."
yes! go right away. you should be able to get some assistance even with no insurance. and if there's a wal-green's in your area they offer a prescription discount card that may help with your lack of funds for a mood stabilizer. if not try sam's club or costco. even if you're not a member by law they have to grant you access to their pharmacy. before i got insurance that's how i was able to afford my meds. also check into lithium. that's a low cost highly effective mood stabilizer. i've been on it for three years and it's the best drug i've ever been on for my bipolar.
if you get bored easily and like to talk with someone invite a friend to be part of your aerobic exercise program. your friend can act as a coach motivator and conscience as well as give you someone to laugh with during exercise. some studies have found that exercising with someone increases the chance that you'll stick with the program.
no. herpes is not in the blood.
hi this lesion may be healed old infection that may have been incompletely cured. though its dormant now it may cause problems later. anti inflammatory tablets and nascent oxygen releasing medicines can heal it to some extent. complete recovery is usually not expected in such lesions. thanks
i recently just got over pneumonia myself and according to my discharge papers it says that if you develop neck pain or stiffness that you should contact your doctor immediately. i had a little bit of both but i believe mine was from the bed rest. i would call your doctor and ask what they think you should do. hope you feel better soon!
he should have a bath or shower every day but limit them to - minutes maximum. stick to simple cleansers that are designed for sensitive skin. once he gets out of the bath or shower he should apply a cream -- not lotion or oil -- to the entire body while his skin is still damp. he should also consider seeing a dermatologist and allergist for testing in case there are specific ingredients/products that he is sensitive to and should avoid. he can also try taking antihistamines. he should be careful about taking any antihistamine before driving. managing stress is also very important since that can cause a flare of the eczema. your dermatologist may also provide you with topical cortisone preparations to help relive the itch/rash as well as cortisone-sparing products that can be very effective as well in maintaining clearance.
this answer is true. most fractures especially of bigger bones will take  to  weeks. smaller bones like those of the fingers and/or wrist will only take - weeks. just gotta baby them. the body is made to heal itself. just let it
quick! there are several different causes of pink eye (conjunctivitis) but the viral and bacterial pathogens can cause an infection in others in less than a day. pink eye caused by allergies or chemical irritants are not contagious.
better ways? no. if you truly have hypothyroidism thyroid hormone replacement is the best way to treat it. there are no rules in medicine that state that all of your symptoms must be related to your hypothyroidism so your doctor needs to look for other things that may be causing your array of symptoms.

hi this is idk (internal derangement of knee). may be due to many reasons. get a mri of knee done to rule out ligament injuries. knee exrcises-quads/hams will help. thanks
there are several possible conditions that can cause lesions on the penis similar to those you are describing. it is important that you see a doctor for an examination to find out for sure what is causing the lesions. infection is one possibility. genital herpes can cause blisters and ulcers that are usually in a cluster. syphilis can cause a lesion that is typically described as a painless ulcer. condyloma caused by the hpv virus can cause raised lesions and plaques. molluscum contagiosum caused by a virus can cause raised lesions. there are several common non-infectious conditions that can cause lesions on the penis. these include lichen sclerosus lichen planus and pearly penile papules among others. have you engaged in any risky sexual behavior? if so this is probably an std so go to the doctor immediately. if not then it is some skin irritation. the best thing for this is a penis health creme called  man oil. it is made just for guys and treats a number of issues down there. you can find this creme online. good luck to you!
sounds like sciatic nerve damage following restless leg syndrome i have it and its horrible i am a nurse and have fibromyalgia and its caused me to have all sorts of issues. see the doctor for meds and therapy
eat more! thats what nearly all weight gain strategies come down to although its not always quite that simple. people with certain health conditions are at risk for poor nutrition: celiac disease inflammatory bowel disease cystic fibrosis cancer chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection many others. people who are losing weight with these conditions should ask their doctor for a referral to a nutritionist. a low appetite is often part of the illness and eating higher-calorie foods is advised. some of these illnesses can also cause poor absorption of nutrients and testing and treatment can address this. in any medical condition if muscle mass has been lost its important to include protein in the diet to help rebuild muscles. healthy young men and teenage boys often want to gain weight usually in the form of muscle. their challenge is usually eating enough to keep up with the calories theyre burning in their active lifestyles. to gain weight by building muscle its necessary to eat a lot of protein. weight-training athletes may require  to  grams of protein or more daily. healthy lean protein sources include chicken eggs fish and beans. whey protein supplements can be mixed in with drinks soups or sauces. soy protein supplements are not advised except in small amounts because some of the soy may be converted to estrogen in the body. its best to talk to your doctor or a nutritionist before starting a high protein diet if you have any health conditions especially liver or kidney disease. gaining weight can be just as difficult as losing weight for some people. an essential component of weight gain is eating enough calories each day. a registered dietitian will be able to calculate and estimate your calorie needs using the harris-benedict equation or there are also websites available to help you do this on your own. in order to gain weight theoretically you need to eat more calories than what would normally be necessary for you to maintain your current weight. keep in mind its still important to eat healthy and make the right food choices. dont use this as an excuse to eat whatever you want because youll end up gaining fat that way. youll need to exercise too especially by incorporating strength-building exercise which will help to build muscle mass to add to your weight. the surgeon general recommends at least two days per week of strength training exercising each major muscle group. of course the more exercise that you do the greater the benefits you should notice. keep in mind however that you do need rest to allow your muscles to recover. make sure that youre getting enough protein in your diet as well. only protein has the essential amino acids necessary for muscle growth and development. a registered dietitian can also help you to determine your protein requirements. ask your doctor before taking protein supplements or beginning a high protein diet. ive recommended a good article for more information: <link>

the stated goal of the affordable care act is to provide near-universal health insurance coverage but that's not likely how it will be. the government projects that nearly  million people are likely to still be left without health insurance.
well the only connection i know between hyoid (lingual bone) malocclusion and hyperthyroidism is that if you have grade iii malocclusion and the hyoid bone is displaced then you can have swallowing difficulties. also thyroid swellings can displace hyoid bone and this can affect occlusion. you need to consult a well trained neuromuscular dentist for an evaluation. you will need to get a cbct or a  ct scan done. this will give the position of your tmj concyles in relation to the ear. physiotherapy traction spinal manipulation chiropractic treatments may help. try and get a second opinion. hope this helps. take care!

i am sorry to know that despite the best efforts you are not responding with current antidepressants and there are active symptoms. i suggest the following treatment given a diagnosis of diabetes with depression. tablet duloxetine (duzela m)  mg in the morning and  mg in the evening. the reason for recommending this medicine is because it is quite effective for pain symptoms associated with diabetic neuropathy along with depression. tablet aripiprazole (arpizol)  mg in the morning. although it comes from an antipsychotic group of medicines my purpose here is to augment the action of antidepressants while addressing anger associated with depression. tablet lonazep (clonazepam) can be continued as per the current level if there is adequate sleep. in case sleep has been an issue despite the medicines i will recommend upping the dose of lonazep to .  mg at bedtime. regarding vilazodone i think it should be removed as it is causing intolerable side effects. also this particular antidepressant has little role in pain associated with neuropathy and i think duloxetine will be a better option. there is need to stop tobacco. this is because many of the medicines mentioned above have poor efficacy when tobacco is consumed. you need to consult your diabetes doctor as poor control of diabetes could be a significant reason for the poor response. consult your specialist doctor discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. in case you have more questions feel free to write back to me. for further queries consult an andrologist online --> <link>

"many parents irked when their teenager sleeps in past noon on saturday mornings don't worry about the kid getting enough sleep. sometimes it seems as though teens sleep the day away! but too little sleep is a real problem for many teens and a particular risk for teens with epilepsy. lack of sleep can lead to poor decisions and an increased risk of seizures. sleep deprivation is an especially serious problem for kids at college. ""at exam time kids may stay up for two or three nights cramming "" says william r. turk md chief of the neurology division at the nemours children's clinic in jacksonville florida. ""and of course they celebrate by drinking like bandits. that combination can definitely result in seizures for people with epilepsy. "" without being too pushy you should try to make sure that your child is getting enough rest. too many late nights whether he's out with his friends or up late doing homework isn't a good idea. while a part-time job may be a good thing for your teenager -- in both emotional and financial ways -- make sure that he's not working so much that it's tiring him out."

"in short yes it can. one of the known side effects of hydrocodone is lowered blood pressure. hydrocodone is an opioid medication. it works to relieve pain by occupying certain receptors within the nervous system. in general opioid medications tend to slow everything down; they can cause sleepiness slower breathing slower heart rate and yes lower blood pressure. however hydrocodone is prescribed for pain. it is not an antihypertensive drug per se. in other words it's not prescribed specifically to help lower blood pressure in a person with high blood pressure. that job is left to other medications designed for that purpose. if you're experiencing any intolerable side effects with your hydrocodone usage please consult with your health care provider. he or she can help you determine if another medication might work better for you with fewer side effects. good luck! yes but keep in mind most at least in the usa most formulations are mixed with something else and pure hydrocodone is hard to come by as they are all mixed with paracetamol aka acetaminophen or other durgs to "" decress retraction users"". acetaminophen which is shown at high dose or with frequent use can actually raid your blood pressure. there are other formulation with hydrococodne all have there risks but as more and more studies are finding acetaminophen use for long times or at high doses ( a few of the  pills) can increase bp. just thought id trow that out there you can look it up if you need more confermation."

your mother's test results show abnormalities. that is why the doctor has recommended cag (coronary angiography). the ecg shows st segment flattening at v which indicates ischemia (reduced blood supply) and can lead to a heart attack. it can occur in patients without chest pain. the choice for the type of angiography should be made by the attending physician. he or she will be in the correct position to decide the best for her based on his experience. there is nothing much to panic. it is mostly due to the long-term effects of diabetes. for further information consult a cardiologist online --> <link>
a healthy diet that follows the myplate. gov guidelines is a good start. fill half of your plate with fruit and vegetable servings one quarter with a serving of whole grains such as brown rice or whole grain bread and the other quarter with a serving of lean proteins such as chicken breast fish turkey or sirloin steak. choose fat free or % fat dairy products. avoid sugary soft drinks and other pre-sweetened beverages. limit your consumption of solid fats such as butter or vegetable shortenings and the foods they're made with.
most experts define infertility as not being able to get pregnant after at least one year of trying. women who are able to get pregnant but then have repeat miscarriages are also said to be infertile. pregnancy is the result of a complex chain of events. in order to get pregnant: a woman must release an egg from one of her ovaries (ovulation). the egg must go through a fallopian tube toward the uterus (womb). a man's sperm must join with (fertilize) the egg along the way. the fertilized egg must attach to the inside of the uterus (implantation). infertility can result from problems that interfere with any of these steps.
"most helpful answer maybe your doctor should refer you to a back specialist (orthopedist) for a higher-level evaluation. musculoskeletal issues in the neck can be very complex so you will need a careful medical history thorough examination of your neck/shoulders and most likely some imaging studies. don't ever worry about asking your doctor ""too many questions"". they are not working for free. they get well-paid to address your concerns."

they should avoid smoking. you probably know that smoking is bad for the heart and lungs but you may not know that it's harmful to bone tissue. smoking may harm your bones both directly and indirectly. several studies have linked smoking to higher risk of fracture. the many dangers associated with smoking make it a habit to be avoided. you may think it's too early to worry about smoking but the habit typically starts during childhood or adolescence. in fact most people who use tobacco products start before they finish high school. the good news? if your kids finish high school as nonsmokers they will probably stay that way for life.
there are a variety of over-the-counter treatments available for athlete's foot. i would need to ask you some questions about what it looks like how long you have had it and what your exact symptoms are to be able to match a product that could help you. i would encourage you to talk to your pharmacist and keep in mind that it could take  to  weeks for it to fully resolve and go away with treatment.

hi i feel this is a skin infection. take anti-histaminic tablets and apply local anti fungal steroid based creams. taking antifungal tablets will help to heal it faster. see a dermatologist if symptoms do not improve. thanks
i strongly urge you to contact your doctor as soon as possible. by going off plavix you have put yourself at a much greater risk of experiencing a life-threatening blood clot. no one should discontinue a prescription 'blood thinner' without consulting their doctor first. you don't say why you were prescribed plavix (clopidogrel) but it's often given to people after they've had a heart attack recent stroke angioplasty procedure or if they have peripheral vascular disease. these conditions put a person at an increased risk of developing a blood clot that travels to the lungs or possibly the brain causing problems breathing or a stroke. to answer your question omega- oils are thought to have 'blood-thinning' properties but they are in no way a substitute for a prescription anticoagulant like clopidogrel. in fact a  study showed they had no effect on coagulation or platelet function after surgery. clopidogrel works by making your platelets (a type of red blood cell that enables blood to clot) more slippery so they don't stick together easily. this effect reduces the chances of blood clotting and traveling to the lungs or brain. again i urge you to contact your doctor and discuss this issue with him or her. at three months without plavix you could very well have a blood clot brewing. your healthcare provider will want to examine you and perhaps run some tests to make sure you're safe. there are many other types of anticoagulants available for your use besides clopidogrel if that product causes side effects. wishing you well!

yes you can have sex when you have a cold assuming your partner is willing to take the risk of sharing your cold or the minor distraction of having you sneeze or cough during an intimate moment. if you feel well enough to have sex it's okay to do it.
under the health reform law a small business health insurance exchange has been set up where you can shop for insurance if you wish to provide coverage for your employees. in texas you would access that through healthcare. gov. small firms in which workers have lower incomes can qualify for tax subsidies to help cover the cost. as a point of clarification plans sold both on and outside of the marketplace are sold by private insurers but to take advantage of tax credits you need to buy insurance through the marketplace. if you're not already offering insurance and your employees have household incomes that would allow them to qualify for subsidies (about $ for an individual and $ for a family of four) they may actually get insurance at a lower cost by going it alone and buying individual rather than small business coverage through the federal marketplace. there's no simple answer to your question unfortunately. you may want to enlist the help of an insurance agent in your area who can help walk you through the various options before you and decide which direction will do your employees the greatest service. to find an agent in your area you can search on nahu. org.
"the answer to your question depends on a lot of information you didn't include. i'll try to give you some general guidance. in the united states levothyroxine is a regulated drug. you can't obtain it without a prescription. so i'm wondering if you mean you took someone else's prescription medicine (which is always a bad idea) or if you obtained some sort of ""natural supplement"" type product that claims to contain levothyroxine (or a related product dessicated pork thyroid). levothyroxine is a thyroid hormone. thyroid hormones are important for regulating many body functions. people who have had their thyroid gland removed (or destroyed with radioactive iodine) or who don't produce enough thyroid hormone generally receive therapy with supplements like levothyroxine. no one should take levothyroxine (or any other thyroid hormone) unless they have been diagnosed with a thyroid disorder. taking unneeded thyroid hormone can cause problems with the thyroid gland and can interfere with many bodily functions. so in short taking a single  dose of levothyroxine on a one-time basis probably is no cause for alarm. but do not take this medication unless it has been prescribed for you by a health care provider. hope this helps! it was given in a pass med for a weekend trip and was not for me. i took the medication then realized it was not mine. pharmacy put someone elses in the bag. i cannot find where there is any real adverse reactions to a single dose of it and since i have not had any of the alergic reactions noted on the label i figure i am ok. dont want to make a trip back to doctor if not necessary. thanks for information."

hi don't forget getting pregnant is all down to timing with lots of other things chucked ion for good measure could be your vaginal mucus to thick or to acidic to male sperm could be his sperm low count or none at all could be your eggs all these things take lots of tests. but you could try doing this take your temperature for  months daily the days when its high is when your fertile keep a note of these days and if there regular have sex  days before reason it take sperm  days to reach the egg and with luck you should get pregnant. all things being well. ok chylimdia can affect his sperm and there mobility as he's had it do a sperm test. would be the best way to go. and could also affect your fertility. do hope this helps. good luck
the short answer is this: your father should continue taking all these medications until a doctor tells him he can stop. perhaps it would help to explain what some of the medications are for. as you indicated the metformin is for blood sugar issues. part of the reason your dad's blood sugar is controlled is because he is using this pill. he should follow up regularly with a doctor regarding his diabetes and should get a hemoglobin  blood test every  months at the lab. the telmisartan is indeed a blood pressure pill. again the reason your dad's blood pressure is controlled is at least partly due to taking this pill. it's very important he not stop or decrease his blood pressure medication after having an angioplasty. clopidogrel is a blood thinning medication. if your dad had stents placed in the arteries of his heart during the angioplasty the doctor may want to keep him on clopidogrel for a year or longer. this medication helps prevent the blood's platelet cells from sticking to the stents and causing a blood clot. atorvastatin is a medication to help keep your dad's cholesterol within normal limits. excessive cholesterol in the blood can cause clogged arteries and heart problems. sorbitrate treats a couple of different heart conditions including angina (chest pain). so as you can see your dad needs all of these medications to help manage his diabetes blood pressure and heart problems. he should not stop or reduce his use of these medications. if you have any questions about this please follow up with his doctor. best to you both!
hi in my opinion you need to do urine test stool test tsh  cbc esr your symptoms do not add up it seems like you have more than one problem only problem i can think of than can explain your cocktail of symptoms is thyroiditis we will aslo use the tests to check for viral or h. pyloi infection good luck

bipolar disorder has no cure but can be effectively treated over the long-term. it is best controlled when treatment is continuous rather than on and off. in the step-bd study a little more than half of the people treated for bipolar disorder recovered over one year's time. for this study recovery meant having two or fewer symptoms of the disorder for at least eight weeks. however even with proper treatment mood changes can occur. in the step-bd study almost half of those who recovered still had lingering symptoms. these people experienced a relapse or recurrence that was usually a return to a depressive state. if a person had a mental illness in addition to bipolar disorder he or she was more likely to experience a relapse. scientists are unsure however how these other illnesses or lingering symptoms increase the chance of relapse. for some people combining psychotherapy with medication may help to prevent or delay relapse. treatment may be more effective when people work closely with a doctor and talk openly about their concerns and choices. keeping track of mood changes and symptoms with a daily life chart can help a doctor assess a person's response to treatments. sometimes the doctor needs to change a treatment plan to make sure symptoms are controlled most effectively. a psychiatrist should guide any changes in type or dose of medication.
hi it does not seem to be only due to allergy definitely. you should get a hrct chest to see any intra thoracic pathology. also get you sputum checked once for presence of unusual micro-organisms that may be causing this. do not take medicines for prolonged periods before getting diagnosed. such medicines will give you only temporary relief
a recent editorial in one of the major medical journals discussed the implications of additional post-residency fellowship training. fellowships are the medical professions finishing schools.  typically they go for one or two years after completion of a standard residency which itself can be up to seven years after medical school. therefore it is a significant investment by a young physician who already has spent much of his or her youth in training and education. fellowships are very important because as the world of medical practice — in all specialties — becomes more and more complex particularly because of new technology and science it is impossible to master all areas of the core specialty. that important editorial was written by a prominent educator in the specialty of head and neck surgery my core specialty. he noted that of the  trainees finishing residencies in head and neck surgery in approved american residencies  percent were pursuing additional fellowship training. that is an impressive percentage. the doctor felt that there were several reasons for that quest for more knowledge and experience. first and most laudable the desire for excellence. next the reality that many young doctors are now reluctant to go into private practice because of the expense the hassles of eternally battling insurance companies and more unproductive government regulation and meddling. tied to that they are going to be drawn to working at universities and other mega-sized multi-specialty medical centers. particularly with those seeking an academic affiliation a fellowship represents a great entry onto ones resume. however the most important thing is whether or not fellowship training for some percentage of surgeons is good for patients. my stance is that it is very important. the best surgeons within narrow niches of given specialties have generally had fellowship training. here is an example from another specialty. orthopedic surgery has so many divisions that it has long operated fellowship programs. after all there are orthopedic surgeons who sub-specialize in spine surgery hand surgery pediatric orthopedics and sports medicine. now there are orthopedic surgeons who do only joint replacements. a subset of that group are the superspecialists in artificial hip placement or artificial knee replacement. this is good for patients because it brings to them the most narrowly focused finely tuned specialty talent. whether you are considering having shoulder replacement or a hernia repair or cosmetic nasal plastic surgery you are generally in the best hands when those hands have been trained by a fellowship.
hi in my opinion your symptoms are typical to acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (guillain barre syndrome ) however the progress is too slow to be guillain barre syndrome common full can cause all your signs. guillainn barre syndrome progress fast within  weeks i recommend going to a hospital once  of march starts or earlier if possible if any more weakness happen rush to a hospital good luck
the question is why havn't you gone already. that i don't think is normal and you should go pronto/now!
in my opinion yes. you can request more time. the medical provider has a way of up-coding the visit so they get paid a bit more by medicare or insurance companies. as a paying consumer (regardless of who actually pays) the doctor really works for you. your paid consultant so to speak. i really feel that they should spend extra time especially if requested by the patient. not all medical maladies can be evaluated and cured in ten minutes (or less)! if your medical provider is not agreeable perhaps it is time to shop for someone who will be compassionate enough to spend the time necessary to meet your needs.

keep your throat moist and drink plenty of fluids specifically those that will not dehydrate you (less or no caffeine). if you have regular issues with allergies partner with your pharmacist and physician to make sure it is right for you concerning the timing or current trimester of your pregnancy. keep gargling with hot water with salt added. you could also keep drinking lemon juice mixed to warm water and add honey insead of sugar. you could have green tea with honey. keep having warm soup and water. take care.

hi sorry for asking and your age is? it would help to help you.
the problem is when men are young theyre going to live forever nothings going to get in their way thats why young guys do stupid things. because its not going to hurt them. why are teenagers promiscuous in the face of hiv hepatitis c and all those other diseases because it will happen to somebody else but it wont happen to them and then as men get older they get into this pattern of reactive care. they dont understand about proactive health care they dont understand that thats their body for life that they have to be in tune with their body and take care of it and if they do the quality of their life experience will be dramatically improved. but when they do these abusive things when they drink too much drugs overweight then that impacts on them. they dont realize that that never happening to me  it will happen and then its just around the corner. and then its often too late. why is it too late? because theyve had years of abusive behaviors. theyve eaten the wrong foods theyve had too much to drink they smoke hypertension diabetes liver disorders cholesterol problems. and those are the guys you know you read about people in their  and  who suddenly get a heart attack and die or have a massive stroke. it doesnt make sense. sometimes its random bad luck but sometimes its things theyve been doing all these years. unlike women who mentally society programs them to be into preventative health. they go to the ob-gyn young in life. they go to the doctor for checkups. women are the leaders in health care in this country almost all of the health care decisions are driven by women. im sure on webmd a lot of the women in fact on the mens health message board a lot of times its women asking the questions. you want to wonder if its about blood in the semen or erection disorders or pain or lumps or bumps how come the guy isnt there asking the question himself? and its because thats not what guys do. guys will comment on it but i dont know whether its fear or denial or maybe they dont value themselves enough but the wives are the ones that go online and ask the questions. even on your message board. even on the mens health message board. women are the ones asking the questions.
we need all healthcare leaders and personnel to act now to help stop cre. its critical for doctors to prescribe existing antibiotics very carefully in order to preserve these lifesaving drugs for as long as possible. otherwise cre could very well be the beginning of the end of antibiotics. other prevention steps include: • knowing if patients in your facility have cre o requesting immediate alerts when the lab identifies cre o alerting the receiving facility when a cre patient transfers and find out when a patient with cre transfers into your facility • protecting patients from cre o following contact precautions and hand hygiene recommendations when treating patients with cre o dedicating rooms and staff to cre patients whenever possible o prescribing antibiotics carefully o removing temporary medical devices such as catheters and ventilators as soon as possible cdc offers other cre prevention guidelines that have proven to reduce cre infections.

"there is no way for a medical provider to blindly answer that question without an examination. i am sorry. i would suggest that you call your medical provider -- someone who knows you and your particular case -- for advise in this matter. anal fissures are tiny tears or cracks. they do not typically have ""bubbles"" so i would be concerned about a cyst or abscess forming."
"your mother's situation with medicare is becoming more frequent. as medicare payments have not increased over the recent years more and more doctors are not seeing new medicare patients. unfortunately the new health insurance exchanges under the health care law are not for medicare patients. but one option your mother may want to consider is looking at available private health plans that serve medicare patients- so-called ""medicare advantage"" plans. the good news is that you can always stay with your traditional medicare coverage. or go back to it if the private medicare advantage options don't work for you."
you'll likely be required to have health insurance (although there are hardship exemptions available to people who don't have access to an affordable option) and your income will determine the kind of financial help you receive to pay for it. if you're currently unemployed it's likely you'll qualify for medicaid which will be made available to you at virtually no cost. if your income is too high for medicaid (about $  annually) you're likely to qualify for tax credits to lower your premiums and possibly subsidies to lower your out-of-pocket costs when you go for medical visits.
it's due to eating different kinds of foods such as much more spicy food or more fat than in our normal diets. that is not something we typically pay as much attention to avoiding when we travel but we have to be wary of these things. not every change in our bowel habits is due to infection. infection is the most important cause of travelers' diarrhea and most is caused by bacteria.
in medical terms the suffix -otomy means to cut or separate. in a tracheotomy a surgeon cuts a small hole in the front of the trachea (windpipe). tracheotomy is most often performed on people who require weeks of mechanical ventilation (dependence on a breathing machine). tracheotomy is also performed in emergencies for choking; for people with neck cancer; as an extreme treatment for obstructive sleep apnea; and for other less common conditions. after the surgeon cuts through the skin and trachea she inserts a plastic tube into the hole. this tube is called a tracheostomy tube (-ostomy means an artificially created passage out of the body). oftentimes the surgery and the tube itself are referred together simply as a tracheostomy.
"you are looking for a gynecologist who specializes in tubal ligation reversal. not all ob-gyns perform this procedure so you may have to spend some time finding just the right person. it's worth noting tubal ligation reversal isn't successful in all cases. women who had tubal ligation using rings or clips generally seem to have the best results from reversal surgery. older women who had large sections of the fallopian tube removed may have less success with reversal. reversing a tubal ligation is not exactly ""easy. "" the process involves a number of pre- and post-operative steps. the surgery itself is generally performed under general anesthesia. the post-surgery pregnancy rate can range from % to %. i mention these things for women reading this post who may be considering having their tubes tied. make sure it's something you absolutely positively want to do because it's not a decision you can easily reverse. tubal ligation is intended to be 'permanent' birth control. if you have doubts about whether or not you really want to give up the ability to have children in the future then i suggest you opt for an intrauterine contraceptive device (iud) or something non-permanent. you can always get your tubes tied later. wishing you well!"
hi if there was any traums to the wrist then this can be caused due to internal injury. if there was no trauma then it may have happened due to sprain unknowingly or may be a joint inflammation. if ice packs and elevation dont help then get an xray done take anti inflammatory and fibrinolytic tablets. compression bandage will help consult a orthopedist. thanks
there are theoretical reasons why patients identified with hiv around the time they are first infected (primary acute infection) may benefit from the immediate initiation of potent antiviral therapy. preliminary evidence suggests that unique aspects of the body's immune response to the virus may be preserved by this strategy. it is thought that treatment during the primary infection may be an opportunity to help the body's natural defense system to work against hiv. thus patients may gain improved control of their infection while on therapy and perhaps even after therapy is stopped. at one time the hope was that if therapy was started very early in the course of the infection hiv could be eradicated. most evidence today however suggests that this is not the case. consequently early treatment is not likely to result in a cure although other benefits may still exist. the current recommendation is that patients with primary infection should be referred to clinical studies where the potential role of therapy can be discussed and further explored. if emotional or social situations make adherence to such treatment questionable however the patients are clearly better off delaying therapy.
ten months gestation? unlikely. that would be pushing the post-term babies a bit longer than the average nine months.
bipolar disorder cannot be prevented. but there are ways to help manage or prevent mood changes. the first and most important preventive measure is to make sure your child takes his or her medicines as directed. bipolar disorder is a long-term condition and generally requires lifelong treatment with medicines. reducing stress getting regular sleep and exercise and staying on a daily routine may help prevent mood swings and can help with the symptoms of depression and mania. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.
hi this whole field of chlamydia is a bit odd some say it does and some say it doe's not have antibodies well he has either been playing away or he does have antibodies if these would protect him and not you and if he does have antibodies he could be a carrier. its a problem as he could have had it a few years ago and out its popped and you got it its that simple. this a couple of other sti's and std's are well known for doing just that and it could be up to  years they call the marriage wrecker's. do hope this helps in some way. good luck
the only way that a women can get pregnant without sex is though artificial insemination something that i know you have not done. being late on your period is very very common in women especially young women and does not mean pregnancy especially in someone who has never had a sexual relationship. most of the time your period will straighten out on its own in another cycle. if not you can see your medical provider but please do not worry that you are pregnant.
its a infected fungal lesion. u should maintain good hygiene. wash your hands regularly after applying local creams to avoid it from spreading elsewhere in the body. consult a skin specialist
"just get him to drink more. not just milk (which can be constipating in some children). the lack of bowel movement is not concerning as long as he is acting fine. when you are not drinking sufficient fluids the body actually pulls water from the colon to use (not the bladder). there may not be any ""extra"" fluid for him to urinate so this is why you need to really encourage good hydration today. signs of dehydration in children would include dry eyes (no tears) and a dry mouth (no saliva). if he has wet eyes and mouth you can just hang in there a bit longer and see if increased fluids today will help. popsicles commercially-available electrolyte solutions jello ice chips etc. all can entice a toddler to hydrate."
hi if this is from his diaper when ever you can get it off him and let his skin breath and be dry yeast infections do love the dampness but letting him in the water will not hurt him but try and leave the diaper off why in the water. as this is a lake? yes when ever you can give the rash a sea salt water wash this will help him and help get rid of the rash. do hope this helps him and you. good luck
a ballot measure to approve marijuana for medical usage was closely defeated in florida during the november   elections. a % voter approval was needed to legalize medical marijuana and only % of the voters agreed with the proposed action. washington d. c oregon guam and alaska gave their approvals to medical marijuana during the same election. proponents of medical marijuana promise to put the measure on the florida ballot again in the near future.
after smoking a doobie on an empty stomach i will tend to wonder into the kitchen and poke my head around in the refrigerator in search of some. munchies! . lmfao
perhaps. redness and swelling are signs of infection or inflammation so it would be wise to see your medical provider to determine the reason. inflammation can be caused by the suture material but your biggest concern would be a wound infection. infected wounds can quickly get out of hand so do not delay in getting this properly examined.
no. you already have shingles. it is just in remission; suppressed by your immune system. you can get a shingles relapse at any time but a new exposure will not give you shingles again.
your question provided specific and helpful details. it was a great question. right up to the beginning of your final sentence. why would you suspect cancer? i know that you are feeling uncomfortable and probably more than a little frustrated; it is understandable. but for the time being i would put cancer near the bottom of my list of possible causes for your condition. your psa result was .  and you had  dres with normal results. urinary frequency can have many causes including infections injury to the bladder dietary influences urinary bladder stones benign enlargement of the prostate gland diabetes & medication side effects etc. treatment of frequent urination is directed at the specific cause. please do not give up in your quest for a diagnosis of this condition. many treatments are available. just for example the following link is from a webmd article citing twenty-two () different medications to treat frequent urination. the first task that is necessary prior to treatment should be to ascertain the reason for your frequent urination. <link> depending on the cause in office non -surgical procedures as well as surgical procedures are available in addition to medications as possible treatment options through your urologist. if your urologist is not investigating and testing for all medical and non-medical causes of your condition then seeking a  opinion from another urologist is justified. with treatments for frequent urination readily available you deserve some resolution to your condition.
the diagnosis of congestive heart failure is most often a clinical one that is based on knowledge of the patient's pertinent medical history a careful physical examination and selected laboratory tests. a thorough patient history may disclose the presence of one or more of the symptoms of congestive heart failure described above. in addition a history of significant coronary artery disease prior heart attack hypertension diabetes or significant alcohol use can be clues. the physical examination is focused on detecting the presence of extra fluid in the body (breath sounds leg swelling or neck veins) as well as carefully characterizing the condition of the heart (pulse heart size heart sounds and murmurs). useful diagnostic tests include the electrocardiogram (ecg) and chest x-ray to detect previous heart attacks arrhythmia heart enlargement and fluid in and around the lungs. perhaps the single most useful diagnostic test is the echocardiogram in which ultrasound is used to image the heart muscle valve structures and blood flow patterns. the echocardiogram is very helpful in diagnosing heart muscle weakness. in addition the test can suggest possible causes for the heart muscle weakness (for example prior heart attack and severe valve abnormalities). virtually all patients in whom the diagnosis of congestive heart failure is suspected should ideally undergo echocardiography early in their assessment. nuclear medicine studies assess the overall pumping capability of the heart and examine the possibility of inadequate blood flow to the heart muscle. heart catheterization allows the arteries to the heart to be visualized with angiography (using dye inside of the blood vessels that can be seen using x-ray methods). during catheterization the pressures in and around the heart can be measured and the heart's performance assessed. in rare cases a biopsy of the heart tissue may be recommended to diagnose specific diseases. this biopsy can often be accomplished through the use of a special catheter device that is inserted into a vein and maneuvered into the right side of the heart. another helpful diagnostic test is a blood test called a bnp or brain natriuretic peptide level. this level can vary with age and gender but is typically elevated from heart failure and can aid in the diagnosis and can be useful in following the response to treatment of congestive heart failure. the choice of tests depends on each patient's case and is based on the suspected diagnoses.
call your dentist so that you can be examined again. this is not normal.
you need to see your medical provider again. you may have post-herpetic neuralgia -- a painful condition after having shingles. there are treatments for this but they are prescriptions.
hi the ecg appears to be quite normal apart from a few hemodynamic variations which are acceptable. a cardiologist could probably comment in details on it though. the present complaints that you are having do not seem to be cardiac in origin. a pinched nerve in neck can cause these symptoms. get a mri neck done. thanks
i have a better idea: stay home. there are a handful of causes of ear pain. an ear infection is infected fluid behind the eardrum in a space called the middle ear.  the medical term for this is otitis media  sometimes called acute otitis media to stress that it begins suddenly. acute otitis media almost always occurs after a child has had nasal congestion for a few days most typically from a cold. if your child complains of ear pain and hasnt been congested it probably isnt an ear infection. even if your child really does have an ear infection you dont necessarily have to rush to have it checked. an antibiotic isnt thefirst thing he needs. in fact it may not be necessary at all! so what should parents do about a weekend or middle-of-the-night earache? if the child looks miserable and sick he really should be seen right away. if the pain is more mild or moderate give him a dose of pain medicine like ibuprofen or have him hold a warm heating pad against the ear. if the pain subsides with these simple measures an emergency trip to the doctor or er is not necessary. what happens if you delay starting antibiotics for an ear infection? as long as the child isnt super-miserable its ok to wait a bit. ear infections it turns out usually go away on their own. waiting a day or two if your child is reasonably comfortable is a good way to avoid extra costs hassle and antibiotics. note that this advice is meant for children older than two who can speak and describe what theyre feeling. if your child is younger you should call your doctor for more specific advice on whether you ought to wait a few days before being seen on the weekend.
sensodyne is a toothpaste for patients with sensitive teeth who would like to whiten their teeth. the jury is out on what is an appropriate age to whiten teeth. whitening toothpastes have polishing agents in addition to the mild abrasives that help remove surface stains from teeth. teeth that have surface stains are cleaned and whitened by whitening toothpastes. however deeper stains wont be affected. if your teeth have deeper darker stains due to injury or certain medications a more thorough brightening treatment such as bleaching or microabrasion will be required. if you choose to use whitening toothpaste make sure the toothpaste contains fluoride as well as whitening agents.
sorry you're going through this. unfortunately it's not possible to diagnose this problem in an internet forum. you need an examination. this will determine the cause of the bump. many things can cause a bump like the one you describe. if it's near your teeth it could be an abscess. if it's in the fleshy part of your skin it could be a cyst. it could also be something scary like a cancer. this is why you should see a health care provider. he or she will be able to tell you what to do to treat this bump. the sooner you have a diagnosis the better. wishing you all the best!
unpredictable. you would have to review her medical growth charts look at the parents and then make an estimate. some girls start their period at age - and grow quite a bit; some start their periods at age  and do not grow as much.
spondylolisthesis is a condition where one vertebra slips forward over an adjacent vertebra. it typically occurs in the lumbar spine and is the result of an injury to or degeneration of one or both of the facet joints of the bone. facet joints help support the weight of the spine and control movement (extension flexion and twisting). symptoms of spondylolisthesis although not present in everyone (it depends on the degree of slippage) can include pain in the low back thighs or legs. pain is due to inflammation of the facet joint or compression impingement or shear forces on a disc. the condition is also associated with muscle spasms weakness and tightness (low back and hamstrings). exercises that emphasize proper body mechanics and stabilize the spine during movements like flexion and extension and stretches for the low back and hamstrings should be prescribed. pelvic tilts abdominal crunches with legs on a chair leg raises (with knees bent and abdominal muscles contracted the bent knee is lifted) and gluteal piriformis and hamstring stretches can all be helpful. proper ergonomics while seated at a desk proper posture while standing and safe lifting technique should all be taught. exercises to avoid are forward bending without the knees bent and abdominals tight bending forward while twisting and any other movement that causes pain. exercises should be individualized depending on the symptoms type and grade of spondylolisthesis. no exercises should be performed if the individual has symptoms and exercises that cause pain should be stopped immediately. you should speak with your client's doctor before you prescribe any exercises and i recommend that you become familiar with the anatomy and biomechanics of the injury as well as the effects of different exercises on the spine.
if the bleeding is coming from those hemorrhoids they may need to be surgically removed. the colonoscopy is going to determine if you have internal hemorrhoids polyps or other reasons to account for your bleeding. prednisone will not help hemorrhoids in any way. even nsaids like aspirin can cause more bleeding so this may not be the best pain medication for you.
since you have employer coverage it is up to your employer what plans are being offered. it is true however that in most states there are one or two dominant insurers in both the individual and small employer market. one of the goals of the aca is to try to increase the number of options available for people who shop through the marketplace. unfortunately that goal was not reached in all areas at least for .
i am finding no direct relation between your back pain and the other symptoms unless you are suffering ibs or the back pain may be due to the pregnancy load on your back that can be aggravated if you have gastroenteritis (diarrhea headache). in my opinion there is no need to worry so far you can visit your doctor if symptoms did not subside after - days but avoid dehydration.
"start with a gastroenterologist. in many cases this can be ""fixed"" with a combination of medications and even surgery. i have had bouts with chronic hiccups my entire life until i found a permanent over-the-counter medicine that cured them for me and keep me from ever getting them anymore (and i am in my mid-'s). i would get the hiccups for  to  days which would lead to other problems with the spasms flaring up my ulcer. i am not a doctor but i know it works for me and improved my quality of life %. the named-brand medicine is not labeled for a hiccup cure and the only main ingredient is what does the job for me. every day i take just one time-released tablet of just plain mucinex (blue and white box) made by reckitt benckiser. although it is designed to work as an expectorant to relieve chest congestion and it thins and loosens mucus it does a whole lot more for me. the main ingredient guaifenesin ( mg) is what stopped my hiccups when i last had them mid- and i have been taking one or two -hour tablets daily ever since. if you get another brand it will probably not be time released so be careful as it may work for  hours at the most. i hope this helps and please let me know if it does because it sure changed my life. my dad is having the same problem. did your dad's condition improved? if so can you please share what he did?"
"i have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. i have struggled and struggled and even though i'm on daily meds i still have trouble. this answer is from my own experience and from my heart. people are genetically predisposed to bpd. that means we're born with it and will die with it. there is no cure. so the first way it affects us over time is that it is a constant ""cross to bear "" for our entire lives and we either cope or literally die. suicide risky behavior or pissing off the wrong person during an episode of rage are some threats to our existence. i have been dangerously near suicide four times - i remember them especially because i was serious. another way it affects us over time - it's like a failing marriage. things are ok a lot of the time but the more and more you argue with the same person about the same thing the frustration compounds and you would do anything just to make this so-and-so go away. well you can get out of a bad marriage. i've been aware of my disorder for five years now and i'm  so this is as far as my experience goes. i don't know how i will be at   . but from the way it looks now my strategies will have to change and become more potent if i am to survive. it is literally a constant battle except that your sworn enemy and foe is inside your head. and it's smart. it's similar to our smartphones and apps now the ones that ""learn"" your search preferences and even your voice over time. it finds a way to use your own thoughts against you. for example if i am going through a mixed manic-depressive episode i believe (with all my heart! ) that no one loves me that i am a failure that i will never be ok and that i should just take myself out. it is literally temporary insanity! i am a healthy vibrant attractive career-oriented single mother of a beautiful daughter with a fully loving and supportive family a therapist who loves me and stays on standby and i have goals. i am a normal person. but during those times i am absolutely certain that i am alone that i will fail at my goals like so many times before and that i have no reason to go on living. its the disease. it talks to me in my head and it's hard to differentiate between the sane voice and the insane one until the episode is over. then i'm perfectly ok. just like that. lastly things that are affected over time are relationships with friends family and romantic relationships and jobs. we struggle with dealing with ourselves so of course others who have to deal with us struggle too. i have had to re-start my career  times because i would build up a great rep at a job and then eventually get fired for emotional instability. so that's where the ""failure"" thoughts come from - how do i know it won't happen again? just yesterday i couldn't stop crying for four hours at work even while interacting with my co-workers. i cannot control or guide when or how intense it will be when it hits. hope this helps!"
i do not know the details of this patient or the reason for hospitalization but aspiration should be prevented unless of course there are specific medical reasons that have lead to his aspiratioin.
hi i do not see how can she be pregnant after a bad bleeding best time to get pregnant should be on the  of april good luck
in my opinion this is long time for treating the infection as i have seen many cases in icu that are similar while less time of infection management after this surgery however i agree with dr. ahmed fawzy it takes time but not as long as  weeks to deal with the problem if it is managed correctly and with high hospital infection control measures.

"you do realize that i have no way of seeing your urinary opening or even knowing if you are a male or female. there is no way for me or any medical professional to answer this question blindly over the internet let alone determine if these ""white bumps or lines"" are serious or not. clearly this is concerning you so take the next logical step and see a medical professional. -- someone who can examine you and hopefully provide the answer."
hot showers will not cause cell damage or cancer. chlorinated water is safe.
the good news is this bump is on the skin. usually lumps on the skin aren't serious (in other words not like a breast cancer which usually resides deeper in the tissue). several things could cause a bump like you describe. it could be a boil for example. if so the good news is it can be drained treated and probably won't return. other than that i wouldn't want to speculate. you've done the right thing by scheduling a medical appointment. try not to feel too anxious. soon you'll know exactly what this thing is and then you can move forward with a treatment plan. feel better soon!
the answer to this question lies in your individual menstrual cycle. depending on the brand (you need to read the box) you can take a home pregnancy test as early as a day after you miss your period. some tests claim you can test  to  days before you miss your period but testing too soon can give you a false negative result. it may be better to wait the few extra days to see if you miss your period and then test. for best results i suggest taking the test first thing in the morning when your urine is most concentrated. home pregnancy tests measure the level of human chorionic gonadatropin (hcg) in your urine. this hormone is produced in great quantities beginning shortly after fertilization of an egg occurs. by taking the pregnancy test first thing in the morning you ensure any hcg in your urine is very concentrated and easy for the test to detect. so step one: wait until you miss your period. step two: home pregnancy test. hope this helps! i had an accurate positive home test  weeks after conception with my  child so yes it is possible. if it comes back positive best thing to do is go to the doctor and get it confirmed. thats what i did
there is no nutritional or health benefits from swallowing semen. this is just a rumor started by men. do it if you want. while it will not make you live longer have clearer skin etc. it is harmless.
your age may be one of the more important determinants in whether hpv testing is recommended. among younger women infections with hpv are very common. often a younger womans immune system is able to fight off an hpv infection. thus some type of pap smear may be the best choice for screening. by contrast if a women in her  or older has a positive test for high risk hpv it might be assumed that she has a more worrisome persisting infection. % of cervical cancers occur in unscreened or under-screened women (demay ). so you do need to get screenings but the type and interval of screening is going to depend upon your age and probably high risk hpv screening tests. liquid based paps do reduce the number of false negative results in the majority of women. ask your gyn if your pap will be a liquid type and if it will be reviewed by automated and human screeners. if you have one of the high risk hpv subtypes by dna testing request a copy of the results for your files so you will know which subtype you have. even if you have received a hpv vaccination you should will still need a pap smear. the recommended interval is still under discussion.
period cramps are expected at your age. it doesnt require a family history to be positive. all depends on your hormones. may be a separate hymen may have aggravated the problems. some hymens are known to thin out and resolve on their own once u get sexually active. so do not attempt home remedies

yesthat could be hypovolemia so drink plenty of water or anaemia get a cbc done.
"you are very very wise to ask this question. while most babies survive rsv just fine no one wants to put their infant through the horrible symptoms! rsv which stands for respiratory syncytial virus is pretty much like a really bad cold. like the common cold there are many many mutations of this virus which means it's impossible to ever be completely immune to it. most children will experience a case or two of rsv. rsv is highly contagious. it spreads in the same ways the common cold does: through direct contact with body fluids like mucus from touching contaminated surfaces and so on. so yes you can ""carry"" this virus from the infected baby (poor thing! ) to your own healthy child. but keep in mind you can catch the virus too. you will want to take precautions to avoid coming down sick yourself. when you visit the ill child try these tactics to reduce the chance of taking rsv home to your own little one: before holding or snuggling with the infected baby cover yourself with a blanket or other barrier that can be left behind or disposed of wear a face mask if the baby is sneezing a lot avoid touching surfaces in the baby's environment as much as possible do not touch your eyes or nose while visiting the ill baby or handling him wash your hands and arms thoroughly after your visit wash any other exposed skin areas touched by the baby (such as your neck which is the most wonderful place to snuggle up with an infant) you can use antimicrobial rub instead of washing but i'm a fan of good thorough handwashing with warm water and soap i'm very sorry to hear the preemie has been struck with this wretched virus. i'm glad to hear he seems to be overcoming it. you're a wonderful aunt to go visit him and i'm sure his mom can use some moral support right now too. wishing you well!"
hi even if an xray is normal we could have been woried that something might be missing. but mri is a very sensitive modality and wont miss even a slightest of abnormality. the pain may be due to the oedema which may be unrelated to the bone metabolism. a physician can rule out this. stress over shin bone can be due to calcium and vitamin d deficiency. start on these supplements. reduce weight if you are overweight. thanks you
i do not know here std status or sexual history either so there is really no way for anyone to know your std risk. if she had an active herpes lesion in her mouth or on her lip you could get an unwanted gift. less common but not out of the question would be chlamydia or gonorrhea which can be pharyngeal (in the throat). if this person had hepatitis b this can also be transmitted although this is typically a blood-borne pathogen. rarely if a person had syphilis this too can be orally transmitted. so this brief act could have potentially exposed you to several different stds. or none at all. should you start having symptoms of any possible stds you will need to see your medical provider so that you can be properly examined and tested.
hi yes you are right. facial manipulative massage sessions with pt can help you to a great extent. take methycobalamin tablets for  weeks as a conjunctive therapy. thanks
being healthy with good circulation diet energy etc. do play a role. could be side effect of drugs or medications you're on if you're taking any. could be something more complicated too which you have to go to urologist. they are pretty cool and get questions like that all the time. vitamin e might help. it has been said to work. otherwise urologist have meds that help im sure you've seen the commercials. a nusance but not a daunting problem. could be your mood too. i have had phases of superhyped to nothin-happenin back and forth throughout the years. sometimes it's the chick! wait it out. try a health kick. maybe vitamin e. if it doesn't go away then see someone but don't freak out.
"a lack of insurance and an inability to pay more than a minimal amount should never prevent you from getting the help you need and deserve. licensed professionals including psychologists have an ethical responsibility to take a number of ""pro-bono"" cases. this means for little or no fee. of course there is a limit to the number of these cases that anyone can take but it's worth asking. you can call your local psychologists association explain your situation and ask for the names of psychologists in your area who would be willing to help you. you can also check social service agencies as well as any major hospital center because these entities generally have access to mental-health providers who require minimal fees."
acne is a skin condition characterized by the excess production of oil from sebaceous glands in which the hair follicles become plugged.
yes those symptoms may not be coincidental. however you might need to wait a little longer to see if you are hiv positive. test results may be incorrect if you're tested too soon. they have a test where they prick your finger just like a diabetes test. it's completely painless and it takes  minutes. they test for hiv antibodies and that's why you might need to wait a little longer to test. if you have an outreach center near you they offer tests for free. also was the rash white? that's a common thing for hiv. flu symptoms are a common indicator. it's certainly possible. the best way is to see if that person you had an interaction with % is infected. bring him/her to a test center. even if it's negative he/she could still be a carrier. it's scary but you can definitely get it under control if you feel extremely off and in danger visit the er just in case it's something else.
i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds very uncomfortable. it's true that antibiotics continue working for some time after you take the last dose. the length of time they keep working depends on the exact type of antibiotic. however at five weeks post-antibiotics you can rest assured they have long since exited your system. and it's very good news that a chest x-ray showed your lungs are clear of fluid. as you probably know pneumonia is an infection of the lungs. this is usually caused by a virus though it can also be caused by bacteria. the problem with either type of pneumonia is that it inflames and irritates your delicate lung tissue. and this irritation can linger even after the infection is gone. this probably explains why you continue to feel symptoms even though you no longer have pneumonia per se. i would suggest you continue to follow up regularly with the doctor who treated you. he or she should be able to better explain the factors that may be continuing to cause you discomfort. you deserve an explanation and your doctor is the person in the best position to tell you. wishing you well!
you have elevated blood pressure. your bp needs to be taken two or three times per day each day for a week or so (get a good bp machine for home use). if your reading continue to be high you will need to see your medical provider for a proper evaluation and treatment. your pulse rate is a bit elevated but can be considered normal depending on your activity at the time.
this is when your urine is most concentrated and likely to have more detectable hcg.
one possible course of action if you live in the us is to visit your pharmacy as quickly as possible and pick up plan b. plan b is the name of an emergency contraceptive medication that is available without a prescription to women over age . you must ask a pharmacist for it and show proof of age. plan b works by either preventing ovulation (the release of an egg) or by interfering with fertilization of an egg. do not confuse plan b with other types of prescription emergency contraceptives that induce a miscarriage. that is not what plan b does at all. if you have any questions consult your pharmacist. he or she also can tell you if it's safe to resume taking your birth control pills. you may also wish to consult your health care provider as soon as possible to go over what happened what you did and get back on track with your birth control pills. if you frequently forget to take your pills keep in mind there are other methods of contraception available to you including depo-provera injections and intrauterine devices (iuds). you may wish to explore one of these options with your health care provider. best of luck to you!

hi ok it seems that the two do go together this is from the uk's nhs its us brits heath service. pelvic examination women may have a pelvic examination if their gp suspects heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) may be the cause of their anaemia. during a pelvic examination your gp will examine your vulva and labia (external sex organs) for signs of bleeding or infection. they may also examine you internally. this will involve your gp inserting gloved lubricated fingers into your vagina to feel whether your uterus (womb) is tender or enlarged. a pelvic examination will not be done without your consent and you can choose to have someone with you. so the best thing for you is get back to your doctor and see about getting on iron tablets to overcome you problem. do hope this helps you. good luck
some practitioners will administer a self-test of screening questions to individuals whom they suspect may be suffering from ocd. in addition to looking for symptoms of obsessions and compulsions by conducting a mental-status examination mental-health professionals will explore the possibility that the individual's symptoms are caused by another emotional illness instead of or in addition to ocd. for example people with an addiction often have obsessions or compulsions but those symptom characteristics generally only involve the object of the addiction. the practitioner will also likely ensure that a physical examination and any other appropriate tests have been done recently to explore whether there is any medical problem that could be contributing to the signs or symptoms of ocd.

no motor symptoms of parkinsons at this time. dlb is being considered; however there is insufficient evidence for that dx at this time. of more concern is what if anything should be done as follow-up to the eeg findings and what conditions could cause said findings.
an expectorant causes you to cough. i am sure that your two-year old is doing just fine in that department. coughing is important because it helps your child clear her airway. an expectorant will only increase the amount of mucous that she will need to clear and she is unable to spit it out. this may cause her to vomit. personally i would not recommend that you use it unless her doctor specifically okayed it.
in my opinion it is good medical treatment for your case while surgery is needed in case of negative manifestations in urination and normal daily life.
talk to your parents and have them take you to see a medical provider right away. it would be impossible to adequately evaluate a person with a headache blindly over the interent let alone determine if they had a brain tumor.

you are very kind to your father. have a physical therapist come to your home (his doctor will need to arrange a referral). the physical therapist will review his medical problems and design a special exercise regime for him. he can also work on his weight at the same time. men can be very stubborn so you will need to convince him to participate. you know your father so do what you can to get him to move and not remain in bed the rest of his life.

"there's no ""best"" way to do it. generally if you get hungry during or after exercise or you feel your energy is running low during the workout then have a snack  minutes before the workout. carbs and protein like in an energy bar are good. if you feel okay during the workout not eating then it's okay. some people can eat a full meal before working out but for the most part too much food in the gut will make you feel uncomfortable during the workout. again if you run low on energy without food during exercise then have something to eat."

mcv stands for mean corpuscular volume. its the average volume of the bodys red blood cells measured in femtoliters (one-quadrillionth of a liter). cell-counting machines calculate mcv from a blood sample. a normal value may vary between laboratories but is usually between  and  femtoliters (fl). an mcv above  fl is called macrocytosis. when anemia (low red blood cell count) is also present its called a macrocytic anemia. causes of macrocytic anemia include deficiency of  or folic acid medication side effects alcohol abuse and certain blood cancers. macrocytic anemia can also occur in healthy people who are rebuilding their blood supply (after surgery for example). an mcv below  fl is called microcytosis (or microcytic anemia if the red blood cell count is also low). microcytic anemia can be due to iron deficiency blood loss (in women most often from menstruation) chronic illness or a condition causing abnormal hemoglobin like sickle cell disease or thalassemia. its not unusual to have an mcv thats slightly abnormal without any serious condition identified as a cause. often in these cases the mcv becomes normal again on its own when its next tested.
hi see if this helps you and your penis just to follow some basic care regimens: drink at least  litres of water everyday. drink cranberry juice if possible as this acidifies urine and is a rich source of vitamin c which would help eliminate any mild infection. maintain hygiene in the affected area. wash your penis gland and opening with warm sea water do let it get inside your penis. avoid the use of any harsh chemicals at or near the urethral orifice. avoid the use of alcohol caffeine and spicy foods. eat fresh vegetables - especially green leafy vegetable. i do hope this helps in some way. good luck
yes you can have a shingles out break anywhere on the body.
like asthma eczema seems to run in families. certain genes make some people have extra-sensitive skin and certain environmental factors -- like stress -- can trigger an episode of eczema. eczema is also caused or worsened by contact with irritants in common substances such as: woolen and synthetic fabrics soap and other agents that dry skin heat and sweat eczema can also be worsened by dry skin. since eczema may in part be an internal response to stress any emotionally charged event -- from a move to a new job -- may trigger a flare-up.
hi you should find this info very interesting and the way chlamyda can hide for many years. most unfortunate is the ability of chlamydia to hide itself deep inside the genitourinary tract making it very difficult to detect by urethral swabbing and urine analysis; two commonly used sample collection methods for chlamydia testing in clinical practice. thus many urologists and std doctors are unable to identify chlamydia as a causative pathogen. as a result they often make general diagnosis such as non-specific urethritis prostatitis and/or pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) etc. and they frequently prescribe a variety of ineffective broad-spectrum antibiotics making the patients condition more complicated; weakening the immune system causing antibiotic resistance failing to address causative pathogens and allowing the infection to spread etc. do hope this helps good luck
the complications of celiac disease include cancers small bowel ulcers (ulcerative jejunoileitis) and collagenous celiac disease. cancer adults with celiac disease have a several-fold higher than normal risk of developing lymphomas (cancers of the lymph glands) in the small intestine and elsewhere. they also have a high risk of small intestinal and to a lesser degree of esophageal carcinomas (cancers of the inner lining of the intestine and esophagus). lymphoma tends to develop in adults who have had celiac disease for longer than - years and in those with refractory celiac disease. symptoms of small intestinal lymphoma or carcinoma include anemia bleeding into the intestine abdominal pain weight loss fever and small intestinal obstruction (with symptoms of abdominal distension vomiting and crampy abdominal pain). small intestinal lymphoma and carcinoma are difficult to diagnose. sometimes in individuals with celiac disease where the disease has been controlled with a gluten free diet recurrence of weight loss anemia abdominal pain and symptoms of intestinal obstruction will lead doctors to search for intestinal lymphoma and carcinoma. computerized tomography (ct) scans of the abdomen enteroclysis (one type of barium x-ray of the small intestine) and enteroscopy (inspection of the small intestine using a long flexible endoscope) are procedures doctors use to diagnose small intestinal lymphoma and carcinoma. sometimes the diagnosis of intestinal lymphoma or carcinoma can only be made with surgery (open laparotomy) or by laparoscopy (examination of the abdominal cavity with flexible endoscopes). the prognosis for individuals who develop intestinal lymphoma usually is poor. long-term survival (survival beyond  years) of patients with small intestinal lymphoma is estimated to be only %. other cancers that may be increased in individuals with celiac disease include cancers of the liver oral cavity and large intestine. ulcerative jejunoileitis ulcerative jejunoileitis is a rare complication of celiac disease. in ulcerative jejunoileitis there are recurrent episodes of small intestinal ulcerations and formation of strictures (narrowing of the intestinal lumen). small intestinal ulcerations and stricture formation can lead to intestinal bleeding weight loss abdominal pain and intestinal obstruction. individuals with ulcerative jejunoileitis are at a high risk of developing intestinal lymphomas. the diagnosis of ulcerative jejunoileitis is made by enteroclysis of the small intestine enteroscopy or ct scan of the abdomen. treatment involves a gluten free diet and surgical resection of the most diseased portions of the small intestine. the prognosis is poor; long-term survival for individuals with ulcerative jejunoileitis beyond  years is less than %. collagenous celiac disease collagenous celiac disease is a rare but serious complication of celiac disease in which a patient may have the symptoms of celiac disease initially but they fail to improve on a gluten free diet and after several years a large amount of scar tissue (collagen) forms just under the intestinal lining. there is no treatment for collagenous celiac disease and the prognosis is poor.

it is possible. any time you change medications you could experience a new side effect. however not all new symptoms are caused by medications. you would need to have your rash examined by a doctor in order to see if it is simply a drug side effect or if something unrelated to the medication is causing the rash.
it sounds great that your cea is not changing and that your colonoscopy looks good. these are exactly the things that we need to follow. you ask a very good question about scans there is data coming out about the radiation risks associated with scans and it has made us think about how we follow patients. i typically follow patients with scans for some period of time usually determined by the extent of their tumor. the reason being is that we can detect any new diease early so that we can more easily address it. it sounds as though you have not had a ct scan since your surgery. if that is the case i think it would be reasonable to get one now that you are nearly  years from completing all your therapy. it may be that this is the only one your oncologist will want to do. i would also recommend discussing your fears about radiation with your physician as it may allow the two of you to come up with a plan that is comfortable for your both. .

the exact amount of protein and fat you need depends on the number of calories you need each day which in turn is based on factors such as your height and activity level. protein should make up about % to % of your total calories a day. so in general women need about  grams of protein each day. thats honestly not hard to get especially if you eat meat. protein is good for satisfying hunger so its safe to include a little more if that helps. a -ounce piece of meat has  grams of protein. even a cup of beans has  grams. and a cup of yogurt has  grams. fat should make up % to % of your total calories. so if youre eating  calories per day you want to eat less than about  grams of fat. and of course make sure it's the good fat sources that you're eating like nuts avocados and olive oil. food labels are a good way to see how many grams of protein and fat are in your food. but keep in mind the -calorie diet thats often referred to on food labels is too much for most women unless youre very physically active.
under-eye circles are due to a combination of factors -- genetics allergies rubbing stress lack of sleep dehydration leftover makeup. look for products that contain peptides sepi-white caffeine niacinamide mulberry root extract or retinoids. chin firming creams should contain retinoids peptides hyaluronic acid growth factors. speak with your dermatologist or plastic surgeon to see if a radio frequency procedure such as thermage is appropriate for you. the results in the chin area can be dramatic.
doctors familiar with the treatment of migraine headaches should prescribe preventive medications. decisions about which preventive medication to use are based on the side effects of the medication and the medical conditions that the patient may have. propranolol (inderal) often is used first provided that the patient does not have asthma copd or heart disease. amitriptyline (elavil endep) also is used commonly. preventive medications are begun at low doses and gradually increased to higher doses if needed. this minimizes side effects from the medications. preventive medications are to be taken daily for months to years. when they are stopped the dose needs to be gradually reduced rather than abruptly stopped. abruptly stopping preventive medications can lead to headaches. in some instances more than one drug may be needed. nonmedication and behavioral therapies also may be needed.

when people tell me that they sleep a large number of minutes but they still feel tired theres a few things we can look at. number one is could they have a sleep disorder like narcolepsy where they actually need more sleep than the average person would need and are they not sleeping enough and thats one of the things making them tired? have they had a recent physical do they have iron poor blood or anemia and are they having difficulty telling the time between fatigue from anemia verses sleepiness? could they have an underlying medical condition thats causing this a low grade fever things of that nature? and then are they really getting the quality sleep that would allow them to feel better the next day? so do they have allergies that are causing poor sleep at night? are they having pets in the bed that could be causing problems with sleep? all are different things that again could decrease your quality of sleep which might make you sleepy during the day.

sometimes the use of skin lightening products over the long term can actually cause hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin). the product you're using contains hydroquinone which has been known to cause skin darkening instead of the expected lightening. at this point your best bet is to avoid using any skin lightening product until you can see a dermatologist or plastic surgeon. he or she can advise you about how to reverse the skin darkening you've experienced. so sorry you're going through this! i hope you get some answers soon. you may be too exposed to the harmful rays of the sun. when using lightening or skin whitening products you have to make sure that you limit your sun exposure. you can check out www. clearclinic. com to achieve a flawless skin.
many times symptoms of one disorder (such as hypothyrodism) are also the same symptoms seen in other conditions. your doctor has probably rechecked your thyroid levels since starting synthriod therapy. your thyroid levels will continue to be monitored  or  x's per year and the dosage may be tweaked up or down. so we may eliminate the thyroid and menapause as causes of your discomfort. some other medical conditions that have symptoms as you describe include: iron deficiency anemia (blood related cause) graves disease (endocrine system related) vitiamin  deficiency (dietary related cause) and others. i suspect that your doctor will run additional blood studies based upon your symptoms and perhaps refer you to other medical specialists as necessary.
the answer is quite possibly yes. part of keeping insurance costs down depends on a good mix of both healthy and sick people in the insurance pool in order to spread the risk. if primarily sick people who use a lot of medical services are signing up for coverage and healthy people do not that can cause insurance costs to rise.

hello friends i had similar problem since almost  years. i am m/ years now. my normal body temperature when i was not feeling feverish would be about .  f (almost  degree fahrenheit lesser than normal). when i am feeling feverish the temperature would rise to about . ish rarely reaching . no doctor would agree that i have fever since it doesn't show up on thermometer. however strangely my skin is very hot to touch and even normal person could feel that but interior body temperature is not. i would feel feverish with chills. i would have episodes of feverish feeling every  months or so and every time it would last for a - weeks. doctor would prescribe some antibiotics and do some tests but they were not helpful. i do not have thyroid or any other deficiency however i have been recently diagnosed with celiac disease as well. the reason i write this time is because something miraculous happened this and i would want others' opinion if it helps relieve your symptoms as well. this might very well be a cure: treatment: : take  paracetamol. after  mins take vitamin c + zinc supplement : continue vitamin c+ zinc daily for next few days. i got fantastic relief on day  onwards and no longer feel hot and my temperature is back to .  j waiting for your inputs and wishing a speedy recovery.

the typical fertile window is - days long and it is just before you ovulate. ovulation typically occurs about  days before the next menstrual period starts. so in a  day cycle ovulation should occur around day  and your fertile period is between cycle days -. the fertile window is determined when the cervical mucous becomes more elastic and receptive to sperm. some women notice that is is more slippery when they wipe during this time. men need to ejaculate once within a week of the fertile window to increase the number of younger sperm that will be in the ejaculate during the fertile window and have intercourse at least once during the fertile window. the day the opk turns positive is probably the last day of the fertile window so i would try a little earlier. don't worry about the semen leaking out of the vagina. that is normal. only about % of the sperm are expected to get into the cervical canal which is a reservoir and will release sperm slowly for days after intercourse to ensure that sperm are present when the egg is released.
"food manufacturers know what people like to eat. they study taste and change up ingredients to enhance taste. that means adding refined sugars fats and salt to so many products -- i don't call many of them ""food "" but instead ""food-like products"" since there's nothing natural about them. there is a growing body of evidence that suggests that there may be two groups of people -- those with no history of addiction in their families but they develop addictive tendencies with processed foods they were weaned on; and another group that has a strong family and personal history of addiction for whom food is a transference of the addiction (you give up drinking smoking or drugs and begin to overeat)."

look for under-eye creams that contain retinoids niacinamide peptides and caffeine. the next step is to see your dermatologist for an evaluation for a fractional  procedure which can tighten and smooth the skin very nicely. be careful to also manage your salt intake get enough sleep and try not to rub the area around your eyes. if you have allergies/sinusitis be sure to keep them under control as much as possible since that can also contribute to the puffiness in this area. the under-eye area is also one place where stress shows very quickly so managing your stressors is helpful as well.

most people being screened for tuberculosis get the tuberculin skin test also called the purified protein derivative (ppd). a small amount of harmless disintegrated tuberculosis protein is injected under the skin on the forearm. within a few days most people who have been previously infected with tuberculosis will develop a raised firm (indurated) area on the arm. redness and bruising dont count. the cdc recommends different cutoffs for a positive tb skin test depending on a persons risk for tuberculosis. for people with no risk factors for tuberculosis an indurated area  millimeters across is considered positive. as little as  millimeters of induration is a positive test for someone with an impaired immune system or a known tb exposure. a trained reader needs to interpret the tb test. most people with a positive tb skin test dont recall symptoms of tuberculosis. they may have a normal chest x-ray as well. nevertheless they still likely have a small number of tuberculosis bacteria hiding somewhere in the lungs. they have about a % lifetime risk of developing full-blown tb called reactivation tuberculosis. to prevent this antibiotic treatment may be recommended after a positive tb test depending on age and other medical conditions.

they typical time that babies are switched from formula to milk is around age  months so you are a bit early. since babies actually need some fat in their diet the change is usually to whole milk not skim or % at first. with the pediatrician's okay and assuming your child is eating well fromt he table you can make those changes but remember that milk and formula are not equivalent.

i totally understand your situation. if the bleeding has not responded to deviry (medroxy progesterone) then i would suggest you take her to the hospital and get her admitted. she would need some blood work done to see her blood parameter also would require injectable progesterones in addition to tranexamic acid (blood clotting medicines). if that also does not help then she would require injectable estrogen. meanwhile the ultrasonography and blood work should give an indication as to why this sudden non-stop bleeding occurred. do not leave it undiagnosed as bleeding so heavily in that age group is not a good sign and might be due to an underlying serious issue. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>

hi i found this piece of info do you think this is you. you should not receive lupron depot if you are or may become pregnant are breast-feeding or have undiagnosed vaginal bleeding. increased endometriosis symptoms (i. e. pelvic pain or pressure and/or pain during intercourse) may occur for  or  weeks after starting this drug. development or worsening of depression has occurred. is this you if so see you doctor. good luck
my short answer to your question is this: any time you've got a lump on the head and you're worried about it it's ok to go see the doctor. a major point i want to make is this: never ever take a blood-thinning pain reliever such as advil (ibuprofen also goes by the name motrin) aspirin (brand names excedrin bufferin anacin etc. ) or naproxyn (brand names alleve naprosyn) after hitting your head. these medications can cause bleeding which could turn a not-so-serious injury into a very serious injury. i'm glad your husband seems to be doing fine and it's always better for the swelling to be on the outside of the skull than the inside. however if your husband has dilated pupils (the black dots at the center of his eyeball) slurred speech or loss of balance you should take him to the doctor right away. these can be signs of a more serious head injury. with a bruise the size you're describing it's likely your husband has suffered a concussion. these may range from mild to severe. again if you have any concerns about the extent of his head injury your safest bet is always to seek medical attention. since it's been more than  hours since the accident you don't need to rush to the emergency room. but you definitely can get evaluated at an urgent care facility or ask your primary care provider to work your husband in for an appointment soon. best wishes to you!
if your nose is extremely sore this is not normal. nor is it necessarily a sign of a sinus infection. i would suggest that you see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated.
if you have recently had surgery and are having these symptoms then you should contact you surgeon right away. he or she will be able to tell you if these symptoms are to be expected in your particular case.
ouch! oh i'm so sorry you're going through this. the symptoms you're describing do sound like ulnar nerve pain particularly the pain to the pinky finger. that's kind of a hallmark. the fact the pain is increasing not decreasing over the course of three weeks means it's time for a trip to the doctor. despite the manner in which you fell it's possible you broke a bone in your arm or suffered a soft tissue injury to an elbow tendon or ligament. the reason to get a physical examination (and maybe an x-ray) is to get treated earlier (when the prognosis is better) rather than later (when the prognosis is worse). while this isn't an emergency you definitely deserve to be seen by your primary care provider to diagnose what is going on and make sure you don't have any hidden fractures either in your arms or your legs. i wish you all the best with this!

i am  years old and not pregnant either but have been bloated nauseous and burping for two months now. i fill full all the time. my sister started with similar symptons three weeks ago now. something is very strange about this. we thought it could be the winter weather change due to lack of sunlight. i eat a very healthy and bland diet and feel very healthy otherwise. i do not take any drugs not even birth control. my sister thinks we have too much melatonin hormone. she read in a hormone book that we may have high levels in the winter that remain in our gut and cause high acid levels in the stomach thus creating bloating and gas. i thought i may have cysts so i went to the doctor for that but all was fine. we are trying light therapy too so the daytime melatonin is not produced. i am only five days into that.
hi playing around and not being protected during foreplay or sex there will always be the chance of getting pregnant if there was masturbation before playing around then the chance would be even greater as sperm would be in the penis. you really need to be careful when playing with sex always think safe sex as safe sex is best. hope this helps you. good luck

some people with hepatitis c do not notice a big difference in the way they feel. others feel tired sick or depressed. the following are steps you can take at home that may help you feel better both physically and emotionally. slow down it is very common to feel tired if you have hepatitis c. ifyou feel tired give yourself permission to do less and rest more. if possible ask others to help out around your home or ask your employer for a shorter or more flexible work schedule. exercise exercise if you feel up to it. aerobic exercise can help you have more energy and may also improve depression. it is best to avoid any strenuous activities on the day after you receive peginterferon. eat regular nutritious meals sometimes people with hepatitis c have a hard time eating. you may have no appetite feel nauseated or have different tastes than you are used to. even if you do not feel like eating it is very important to eat small meals throughout the day. some people experience nausea in the afternoon. if this happens to you try to eat a big nutritious meal in the morning. if you have cirrhosis it may not be a good idea to eat salty foods or foods that are high in protein. if you want to know more about which foods to avoid and which foods are good to eat ask your doctor about meeting with a registered dietitian to discuss a healthy eating plan. avoid alcohol and drugs one of the most important jobs of your liver is to break down drugs and alcohol. if you have hepatitis c one of the best things you can do is to avoid substances that may harm your liver such as alcohol and illegal drugs. if you have cirrhosis you also may need to avoid certain medicines. if you use illegal drugs or alcohol it is important to stop. being honest with your doctor about your drug and alcohol use will help you deal with any substance abuse problems. if you do not feel that you can talk openly with your doctor you may want to find a doctor you feel more comfortable with. if you want to stop using drugs or alcohol and need help to do so ask your doctor or someone else you trust about drug and alcohol treatment options. because many medicines can stress your liver talk to your doctor before you take any prescription or over-the-counter medicines. this includes herbal remedies as well. control itching if you have itchy skin ask your doctor about taking nonprescription medicines such as diphenhydramine (for example benadryl) orchlorpheniramine (for example chlor-trimeton) to relieve itching. if you do take these medicines be sure to follow the instructions and to stop using the medicine if you have any side effects. seek help for depression depression may develop in anyone who has a long-term illness. it also can be a side effect of antiviral medicines for hepatitis c. if you are feeling depressed talk to your doctor about antidepressant medicines and/or counseling. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.
the symptoms of cystic fibrosis vary from person to person and over time. sometimes you will have few symptoms. other times your symptoms may become more severe. one of the first signs of cystic fibrosis (cf) that parents may notice is that their baby's skin tastes salty when kissed or the baby doesn't pass stool when first born. most of the other signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis develop later. they are related to how cystic fibrosis affects the respiratory digestive or reproductive systems of the body. respiratory system signs and symptoms people who have cystic fibrosis have thick sticky mucus that builds up in their airways. this build-up of mucus makes it easier for bacteria to grow and cause infections. infections can block the airways and cause frequent coughing that brings up thick sputum (spit) or mucus that's sometimes bloody. people who have cystic fibrosis tend to have lung infections caused by unusual germs that don't respond to standard antibiotics. for example lung infections due to bacteria called mucoid pseudomonas are much more common in people who have cystic fibrosis. an infection caused by this bacteria may be a sign of cystic fibrosis. people who have cystic fibrosis have frequent bouts of sinusitis an infection of the air-filled spaces behind your eyes nose and forehead. frequent bouts of bronchitis (bron-ki-tis) and pneumonia (nu-mo-ne-ah) also occur. these infections can cause long-term lung damage. as cystic fibrosis gets worse you may develop more serious complications such as pneumothorax (noo-mo-thor-aks) or collapsed lung; or bronchiectasis (brong-ke-ek-ta-sis). some people who have cystic fibrosis also develop nasal polyps (growths in the nose) that may require surgery. digestive system signs and symptoms mucus that blocks tubes or ducts in your pancreas and prevents enzymes from reaching your intestines causes most digestive system signs and symptoms. without these enzymes your intestines can't fully absorb fats and proteins. this can cause ongoing diarrhea or bulky foul-smelling greasy stools. intestinal blockage also may occur especially in newborns. too much gas or severe constipation in the intestines may cause stomach pain and discomfort. a hallmark of cystic fibrosis in children is poor weight gain and growth. these children are unable to get enough nutrients from their food due to the lack of enzymes to help absorb fats and proteins. as cystic fibrosis gets worse other complications may occur such as: pancreatitis (pan-kre-a-ti-tis). this is a condition in which the pancreas become inflamed which causes pain. rectal prolapse. frequent coughing or problems passing stools may cause rectal tissue from inside you to move out of your rectum. liver disease due to inflamed or blocked bile ducts. diabetes. gallstones. reproductive system signs and symptoms men who have cystic fibrosis are infertile because they're born without a vas deferens. this is the tube that delivers sperm from the testicle to the penis. a woman who has cystic fibrosis may have a hard time getting pregnant because of mucus blocking her cervix or other cystic fibrosis complications. other signs symptoms and complications other signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis are related to an upset of the balance of minerals in your blood. cystic fibrosis causes your sweat to become very salty. as a result your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. this can cause dehydration (a condition in which your body doesn't have enough fluids) increased heart rate tiredness weakness decreased blood pressure heat stroke and rarely death. cystic fibrosis also can cause clubbing and low bone density. clubbing is the widening and rounding of the tips of your fingers and toes. it develops late in cystic fibrosis because your lungs aren't moving enough oxygen into your bloodstream. low bone density also tends to occur late in cystic fibrosis. it can lead to a bone-thinning disorder called osteoporosis.
you bring up two important issues regarding the treatment of adhd with medications. first the difficulty finding the right combination of medications when co-existing conditions are present and second the use of adhd medications during pregnancy. when choosing a medication to address adhd symptoms it is extremely important to keep co-existing conditions in mind and not make them worse with treatment. some co-existing conditions such as mild depression/demoralization or anxiety may be the result of untreated adhd and will improve once the adhd is treated. however some stimulants may make anxiety (or depression) worse particularly those in the amphetamine class so its best to avoid those if you can if you have anxiety. in addition other therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) have been shown to improve symptoms of anxiety in persons with adhd. this treatment can be a particularly useful adjunct for those with anxiety/self-esteem issues or who can not take medications for whatever reason. that brings us to the second issue pregnancy and medications used to treat adhd. basically the stimulants are not recommended for use during pregnancy in order to avoid any possibility of damage to the developing fetus. there have been no studies done in humans but cardiac defects have been seen in animals given very high doses of stimulants during pregnancy. if you are contemplating getting pregnant it is best to discuss this with your prescribing physician and ob/gyn and wean off any stimulant treatment.

"i don't know if your feeling will return or not but many times these severed nerves will eventually reattach and your feeling will return. this can take a month or more. in my own case with a similar injury my finger remained ""numb"" for years. now i have partial feeling. unfortunately unless the medical provider reattaches a severed nerve you are at the mercy of your body's healing ability."
"i am not sure exactly what ""fleshy area"" you are talking about so i would suggest that your bring this up during a gynecological exam so that your practitioner can address this concern. most normal female anatomy does not interfere with intercourse but if you have some sort of a unique anomaly then a medical provider will need to see it. the urethral area alone can be quite sensitive from intercourse. in the meantime please ask that your partner exercise a bit more caution during sex so that any sensitive area is not traumatized."

a fever is not your body fighting an infection. anything that heats up your body including heat and induces sweating causes a fever. fevers cause heat exhaustion and heat stroke as heat heats up the body inducing sweating wich causes water to be ejected from the body. you may induce a fever and prove this by simply visiting a steam room and when your sweating check your temp youll have a fever. you may also go out jogging and see when your hot and sweating you have a fever with a fever thermometer. if you do either for long periods youll eventualy drop from exhaustion enjoying before that mild to severe dehydration symptoms heat exhaustion and heat stroke and possible mild heart attacks. cardio excersize and steam rooms have been around for centuries inducing fever and not cured any disease other than treat obesity. your heartrate can generate heat and cause a fever by pumping friction wich happens during jogging just like shaking a pop can or rubbing your hands generates warmth. make sure you maintain bodyweight during a fever. if food poisioning is suspect having a person stomach pumped and an enema given may be needed if fatigue sets in. fluid calories are better during a fever its important to maintain heartrate as lowering your heartrate also induces fatigue. if a fever is starting with no fatigue water may be ok. its important to keep dry and keep cool (keeping dry to avoid chills). humans thrive in cool temp climates of - degrees thier is little life in deserts do to heat heat starves an area of water. for children its important that children playing maintain thier bodyweight during excersize/play and eat and drink and take rest breaks and normalize thier heartrate reducing sweating. if people have to loose weight then i recommend simply getting out and walking bringing food fluids before or during thier walk to avoid dehydration with rest breaks. obesity causes fever and dehydration by carrying around - lb weights. you may simulate obesity by carrying a backpack of -+ lb barebell weights and grow it daily and see what affects that has on your health. weather and activie levels can affect weight loss. people eat drink and rest to maintain thier heartrate and energy levels. in a virus or poision a fever is a response to excess blood volume wich causes your heart to pump harder and faster generating heat. you may simulate this by giving an unnecessary blood transfusion wich will likely cause a fever and may cause a mild heart attack so i wouldnt advise it. water causes weight gain at / lb a cup its a myth its zero caloric. overdrinking from dehydrationcan cause excessive urination in addition to lowering your heartrate further so cold water if a fever has started with no fatigue otherwise fluid calories.
a  pound infant is likely a very new baby. for a child of this age and size i would first check with the childs pediatrician. acetaminophen is labeled for over-the-counter use in children  years of age or older. parents trying to treat a child this age should really talk to the pediatrician first. if the pediatrician says it is ok to give the child acetaminophen then we do need to consider the childs weight in order to dose the product appropriately. tylenol infants and childrens products have recently been reformulated so that they now contain the same concentration of acetaminophen  mg/ ml. however if you have an older package of tylenol (acetaminophen) at home then it may have a different strength. it is very important to know the product you are working with so that we give your child the correct amount. talk with your pediatrician or local pharmacist who can tell you the correct dose for your child based on weight and the product you have on hand. you will need to measure the correct amount with the dropper that is packaged with the product. your local pharmacist can help you use the device that you have so that the appropriate amount of medication is given to your child.
most helpful answer there has been a backlash against low fat diets leading people to go in the opposite direction embracing diets high in saturated fat diets. the truth is diets low in saturated fat won't reduce heart disease risk if the saturated fat is being replaced with refined carbs. this decreases hdl (good cholesterol) and can increase triglycerides and the blood sugar response. but as both of the review studies below demonstrate when saturated fat in the diet is replaced with plant and fish sources of fat (omega- fatty acids and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats) it decreases heart disease risk -- hdl increases and ldl (bad cholesterol) decreases. <link> <link> this is basically the mediterranean diet -- low in saturated fat high in fruits and vegetables and healthy fat sources like olive oil and nuts. while the french may have diets higher in saturated fats they also tend to be leaner walk more and eat other heart healthy foods like fruits and vegetables. while the evidence continues to evolve there isn't enough to recommend a diet high in saturated fat to reduce heart disease. yes some propit change to lipid and make your belt bigger. see more here hi for those who have interest in saturated fat have a good read through this one site there is lots on it. <link> just copy link into google to the www. to open and read. should help some of you. good luck our old belief was that saturated fat have the ability to raise cholesterol levels and give us heart attacks but s everal recent review studies that combined data from multiple other studies found that there really is no link between saturated fat consumption and heart disease h owever it's a fact that replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats reduced the risk of cardiac events by %. so it's always better to stay away from a fatty body. i had a very fatty body from my childhood it self but by doing a plastic surgery procedure at montreal omar fouda neel clinic i reduced overall body fat and there by weight. i think the links you have are pretty awesome. sf's are great just really need to have them in moderation i would think.
catastrophic plans are plans under which an individual pays the vast majority of out-of-pocket expenses until he/she reaches the plan's deductible. some pros of catastrophic coverage are: catastrophic plans offer more affordable monthly premiums for an individual who might otherwise not purchase insurance coverage at all coverage under such a plan as suggested by its name will at least protect them in the event of a catastrophic event such as a car accident or serious illness that could result in hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills which would plunge many people into bankruptcy the major con of catastrophic coverage is that it covers very few out-of-pocket expenses before the deductible is met and the deductibles under these plans can be quite high. so these plans may not be ideal for individuals who have substantial out-of-pocket expenses. this would include those who take a significant number of prescription drugs on a regular basis and/or find themselves visiting a physician frequently.
i have no way of accurately making a definitive diagnosis based solely on your description. a medical professional would have to examine you and perhaps run a rapid strep test or a culture. or even a mono test if clinically indicated. while most sore throats are viral and self-limiting you need to remember that mono is a virus too. not all diseases have all of the symptoms such as fever etc. if you want to know. definitively. what you have you will need to see a medical professional.
she will need to see her medical provider for another neurological examination for clearance. recovery from a conclusion varies from person to person so to be on the safe side her doctor needs to make that imporant determination.
that is a very difficult question on answer since i do not know the details of your molestation or if you had any physical injuries as a result. having been a sexual abuse forensic investigator for many years my experience has been that the greatest damage is psychological not permanent physical damage. just guessing i would say that you are most likely capable of getting pregnant. you can certainly see a gynecologist for a thorough examination to be sure.
plenty of ideas. hundreds in fact but an idea is not an accurate diagnosis. a diagnosis or treatment can not be accomplished blindly over the internet. you will need to see a medical provider -- someone who can take a good medical history examine you first-hand order any diagnostic tests and then. provider a treatment plan for you.
hi and you how old now? if you have been on the pill for a long time and was never taking breaks it could take up to two years to get pregnant. its just the way its works the odd women comes off the bc pill and gets pregnant after that the time scale just gets bigger and all could have been on the pill for lets say  years. are your cycles going the way they should? if yes all you can do is wait it out just relax put it to the back of your mind and enjoy your sex life. getting stressed over it will only help stop it happening. ok good luck
financial assistance is available based on income and the size of your family. if you qualify for a tax credit to lower the cost of your insurance premium you have a few choices about how to take advantage of it. first you can have the money sent directly to your insurer so you pay the lowest possible cost for your coverage. the second option is to pay the full amount of your premium throughout the year and take the tax credit at tax time. or you can take some of the cost reduction during the year to lower your premium by a bit and take the rest at tax time. you would just have to specify what you want to your marketplace when you sign up for coverage.

i am a paramedic and have dealt with something like that. it turned out that the patient had changed deodorant and was allergic to a chemical in it. if your son has swapped deodorants it is likely the case so have him stop use and take some benedryl for a couple days and should clear up.
in general medicare part d covers prescription drugs approved by the fda. but whether a specific drug is covered depends on your particular part d or medicare advantage plan. your policy may choose to cover this new medication or decide to cover another drug(s) used to treat diabetes but not afrezza. you'll need to call your insurer to find out if and how much of this medication's cost it will cover. as you know while this drug has been approved by the fda it's not yet available in pharmacies so in addition to asking your insurer if it will ultimately cover the drug you may wish to inquire if the company knows when it might be available.

the most common form of neutropenia in infants and young children is transient neutropenia with or following a viral illness. it resolves itself within  weeks. if it lasts longer than that or the child is very ill then a full workup for neutropenia would be recommended. in infants aged  weeks to  year the lower limit of the normal neutrophil count is /l. after the first year of life the lower limit is /l as in adults. spontaneous recovery in such cases occurs by age  years and the mean duration of neutropenia is approximately  months. the clinical severity and frequency of infections rather than the severity of neutropenia would be used to determine the further management of the condition. hence you should continue to work with the treating doctors for appropriate medical advice. i hope this helps.

harmful? yes even one to two cigarettes a day exposes you to cancer-causing chemicals and tar. they are harmful to your respiratory tract / lungs as well as other body areas. if secondary smoke is known to be harmful than certainly first-hand smoke is worse. why don't you just quit now? what is this six-month crap? the sooner you stop the more likely your body will repair damage and hopefully restore your lungs to the non-smoking level that you had previously.
i'm no physician but i'm familiar with friends and family who have diabetes. even if physically fit people can still have diabetes. it may also be a sign that the level of iron in your blood is significantly low. anemia is a condition associated with low iron where staying warm is a challenge. taking iron pills or daily vitamins may help your blood stay healthy and circulate properly allowing good blood flow through out the body. thus keeping your body temperature normal. probably having your blood sugar and levels checked couldn't hurt. at least that would be two things you could narrow down on the list. <positive_smiley>

some people do notice that their hair can be thicker and fuller when pregnant and this is a hormonal fluctuation. so what happens is that your hair has three cycles of growth: it has a growing phase a resting phase and a falling out phase. sometimes with the hormones and the changes in pregnancy your hair stays in that growing phase longer. so you have more hair in that growing phase so your hair looks thicker and fuller and grows longer and often is more shiny as well. what happens though is three to four months after pregnancy when those cycle shift back all of a sudden that hair starts to shed as you revert back to your normal hair cycles. so if all your hair grew in the growing phase at the same time and then shifted to the resting phase every two to ten years or so you would go bald completely. but fortunately that pattern is not synchronized. so about % of your hair is growing and % is resting or falling out. so if that patterns shifts you might notice that your hair looks fuller for a while but there is a price to pay on the other side and then it will balance back out. yes mine did. and then after i had my baby girl i lost quite a bit of it <positive_smiley>
most helpful answer i'm not sure i fully understand the question but let me try to cover as many bases as possible. certainly you won't be required to undergo any psychological treatments as a result of the law. unless treatment is court ordered you always have the right to refuse it. if what you're asking is whether you can buy a health plan that does not pay for mental health and substance abuse services the answer is no. there are religious exemptions under the law that would allow you -- if you meet criteria -- to avoid having to buy insurance at all. but there is no way for you to buy an insurance policy and pick and choose the specific benefits that come with it based on your personal belief system.

"yellowing of teeth is mainly due to one of the following or a combination of these: ) tartar or plaque deposits (soft yellowish deposits) on the teeth. ) calculus deposits (calcified hard deposits) on the teeth. ) fluorosis - internal discoloration of the teeth due to altered fluorine content in the drinking water. you have given an excellent description of the clinical condition of your oral cavity. from your history it is very clear that the yellowness of your teeth is due to plaque and calculus deposits. plaque as you have mentioned is yellowish and creamy. this gets partially removed with brushing. calculi are hard deposits either yellowish greenish or sometimes blackish in color. they are firmly attached to the teeth and do not go off with brushing or tooth powder. even the abrasiveness of the tooth powder cannot remove the calculi. during childhood due to improper brushing there are chances of plaque and calculus formation over the teeth. because children at this age tend to be playful and do not concentrate on oral hygiene. ""tooth worms"" as people say are nothing but bacteria that affect the teeth. these bacteria act on the teeth and cause demineralization of the teeth and lead to tooth decay and cavities. the lower incisors and canines are more prone to plaque and calculus deposition (v shaped deposition in accordance with the tooth morphology) due to inability of us to reach the inner sides of these teeth while brushing. at this age of yours these deposits may be due to: ) improper brushing technique. ) brushing only once a day. ) malalignment of your teeth. ) crowding of your teeth (due to inadequate spacing in between the teeth). ) if you are having any prosthetic teeth (crown bridge removable appliances). ) if you are undergoing orthodontic treatment (wire braces). dental scaling is the procedure that removes plaque and calculi. but it does not mean that these deposits will not come back again. continuous oral hygiene maintenance after scaling is mandatory to prevent recurrence of plaque and calculi. hence scaling is not a wastage of money it is an investment to prevent one's teeth and gums from infections and thereby increase the life of the teeth. so a permanent solution for your problem is to follow these steps to maintain oral hygiene: ) brush with toothpaste and brush twice daily. the head of the toothbrush should be angulated in such a way that it reaches all the teeth and all the interior and hidden parts of the teeth. ) use an antibacterial mouthwash only for the time period for which the dentist has prescribed. because long term use of mouthwash itself will cause staining of teeth. ) rinse your mouth thoroughly soon after every meal. ) in case you are wearing wire braces or prosthesis use the specific tooth brushes (orthodontic toothbrushes) to clean the teeth thoroughly well. ) use interdental toothbrushes to clean the minute spaces in between the teeth. ) visit a dentist once in every  months and get a scaling done if necessary. as your doctor has told regular use of colgate toothpaste is sufficient. sensodyne toothpaste is not needed for you since it is used for hypersensitive teeth. glodent toothpaste helps in stain removal and it can be used if extrinsic stains are present on the teeth. it does cause teeth whitening. regular use of mouthwash is not essential. you can use hexidine mouthwash for about two weeks and then stop it. bleaching is the procedure used to remove internal or intrinsic staining of the teeth which is not required for you. and finally pearl white color of the teeth indicate that they are unhealthy. teeth which are slightly yellow without any deposits on them are said to be healthy. hope this answer helps you. take care. consult a dentist online for further follow up --> <link>"

my  yr old father lives with my husband and myself. he also has dementia and does as you described in asking same thing over and over. i've learned once we've talked about subject few minutes if i either turn my back or have him turn around he forgets what he asked and immediately i can change subject or draw his attention away and into something else. also i've learned never to talk with him while tv volume is on or he is looking elsewhere. when he looks at me he's more likely to retain something. hope this works somewhat for you as well.
yes. this is a really a infection of skin lining in the ear canal.
hi found you this info below from <link>#tcm:- there are two ways of giving brachytherapy for prostate cancer. small radioactive seeds can be inserted into the tumour and left to release their radioactivity slowly. this is sometimes known as low-dose rate treatment. the seeds are not removed and the radiation gradually fades away over about six months. all the radioactivity is absorbed by the prostate so its safe for you to be around other people. as a precaution youll be advised to avoid long periods of close contact with children and pregnant women. your specialist will give you more information about the precautions you should take. alternatively the seeds can be placed inside special catheters that have been inserted into the prostate gland while youre asleep in an operating theatre. the seeds are put into the catheters for a set period of time and are then taken out. this is known as high-dose rate treatment. after the treatment the catheters are removed and no radioactive material is left in the prostate gland. do hope this is what your looking for in the way of help. good luck
in the u. s. using a deodorant is usually standard (not so much in other countries). it is one thing to smell nice it is another thing to smell offensive to others. as a medical provider i have grown accustomed to all extremes of human odors. i am not a big fan of any human that is overly-perfumed. i would prefer bo over someone that smells like an overpowering rose garden. some offices ban excessive perfume since some people may be chemically-sensitive or allergic. whatever you choose keep it subtle. deodorants can be scent-free and a tiny amount of perfume can be pleasant.
high blood pressure -- in men and women -- is a big problem. one in every three adult americans -- about  million people -- have high blood pressure also known as hypertension. many more are at risk of developing it. over half of all americans  and older have it and over a lifetime the risk of developing high blood pressure is %. typically blood pressure increases with age. the risk of high blood pressure begins to climb when men hit  although it can occur in younger men. african-americans tend to develop it younger and have more severe hypertension. obesity or a family history of high blood pressure also increases risk. high blood pressure is especially dangerous because people can have it for years without knowing. in fact one in three americans with the condition doesnt know it. despite these gloomy statistics however high blood pressure is not inevitable. there is plenty you can do to prevent delay and treat high blood pressure.

i would not recommend that you randomly take an antibiotic that you have at home since utis are caused by many different types of organisms (some that are resistant to amoxicillin) and about half of the people who have classic uti symptoms do not even have one (those symptoms can be caused by other medical conditions). when you take an antibiotic before having a urinalysis and culture your medical provider will not have any idea if (a) you actually have a uti and (b) what is the most appropriate antibiotic to use. in most cases it is not amoxicillin.

i strongly recommend returning to both the eye doctor and a dermatologist. while it isn't common blindness can be caused if the shingles virus infects the eye. if the blisters are anywhere near his eye this can be a concern. it is also possible that the anti-viral they have him on simply isn't effective for him. i was prescribed two different anti-virals to treat my shingles outbreak last fall because the first wasn't giving the results we wanted probably due to an incompatibility with my own body chemistry(that's what the dermatologist told me).
it may but generally not connected. they may co-exist without any relation.
if your kids are experiencing common nasal congestion and mild cough you might consider trying remedies that thin out mucus such as nasal saline drops/spray humidifier steamy bathroom treatments and propping the kids up in bed by putting a pillow under the mattress. of course keep them well hydrated too. these days we no longer use over the counter cough and cold remedies until the kids are much older (- yrs old). .

taking biotin while using zoloft and the nuvaring should not cause any problems. there is always the potential for drug interactions so you should always ask your doctor before starting new medicines or supplements.
yes it is possible but the re-anastomosis (re-attaching the tubes) is a very delicate microsurgical procedure that has a significant failure rate. it is also very expensive and not likely covered by your insurance since you had a voluntary sterilization procedure. you can consider in-vitro but this is expensive and may not be insurance covered either. you can apply to adopt a child if this is an option that you have not considered.
neuritis with fibrosis also seems to be the cause of pain. while sciatica can be managed by aggressive physiotherapy muscle relaxants and laser treatment can also have beneficial effects

hi the symptoms seem to be due to the white matter scattered lesions in the fronto-parietal lobe of the brain. these may have occured due to tiny blockages of the small blood vessels that are meant to supply blood to the brain substance. nothing substantial to worry about. consult a neurologist and you will be fine with medicines.
mosquito bites do not cause high fever or hives. horsefly bites cause high fever and hives. if you get bitten by a mosquito it just leaves a little red itchy bump. horsefly bites are more serious. if you are bitten by a horsefly it leaves a huge red bump about - inches long. and about  days later the bump fades away but then you start to get one itchy bump on a part of your body and if you scratch you break out in the known reaction as hives. the best cure for hives is an oatmeal bath or milk of magnesia. and of course rest. i wish you all good luck and p. s. stay away form horseflies.

teeth grinding or what we call bruxism can have multiple effects. so number one it can increase jaw pain. and we know that pain can affect your ability to fall asleep quite significantly. it can also cause tooth damage. so if you see those or youre concerned about that you should talk with your dentist immediately. what can be done. usually you can use a night guard. theres some pretty fancy night guards out there that cost hundreds and hundreds of dollars. quite honestly if you go to a sporting goods shop and you get one of those boil and bites youll be fine. whats a boil and bite? a boil and bite is a plastic piece that you drop into a pot of boiling water and then you put it into your mouth and it will mold to your teeth and then you can sleep with it. and usually you can see them football players use them soccer players use them and people like that.

i recommend you to do the usual workup routine investigation and pelviabdominal usand i would like to ask the same questions like my colleague dr ahmed has asked you waiting for your reply 🙂
there are limited options due to your planning pregnancy. each medication is assigned a pregnancy category by the fda. speak with your dermatologist about medications that would help you and be safe to be on/continue should you become pregnant. these are typically medications that are in pregnancy category b. there are also in-office treatments that can be helpful. you can try with herbal combination of haridra amalaki shatavari lodhra jeerak ashoka in equal proportion at th dose of - gms twice daily to reduce the hormonal imbalance in pcos. for acne use aloe gel with haridra powder and apply locally on acne site.
no. she is not going to kill cook or hard-boil those ovarian eggs. she is more likely to burn her belly. it would be a good idea to put a pillow or one of those special laptop trays to dissipate the heat from her computer use a table or not say on for so long. when she ovulates (once per month) her eggs will be safe.

"masturbation is actually a normal behavior. but it should not be excessive in frequency which may cause fatigue and back pain. you need not see a doctor right now. just divert your thoughts into much important things in life like studying enjoying outdoor sports finding good friends etc. try to reduce the frequency of the practice to about twice or thrice a week. this is the transient period in everyone's life when urge to explore and also trying to experience new things especially sexual pleasure occurs. as you are physically and mentally mature the problems that you are facing now will resolve spontaneously. apart from this as you said ""proper diet and lifestyle changes"" are to be followed: eat nutritious foods (encourage fruits vegetable salads nuts cereal sprouts). limit processed and deep fried foods. indulge in outdoor sports which you are interested like swimming etc. sleep adequately at least - hours as it is much needed for your normal growth too. avoid smoking and drinking alcoholic beverages. just follow these for a month and let me know how do you feel. get back to a sexologist online for further follow up --> <link>"
dentists are very careful so it is unlikely that you are at risk. the herpes virus that causes cold sores will not jump off of his lip onto you. since you did not have any direct contact you will be fine.
there's a lot going on at puberty that could be contributing to your daughter's weight eating and cholesterol. first off weight gain especially around the middle for girls is normal and to be expected as she is going through the second largest growth spurt of her life. but if she is not being fed well balanced meals at regular intervals excess weight and unhealthy habits can occur. also this is a time when iron deficiency risk increases with the onset of regular periods which can cause low energy. i suggest you visit her doctor and get blood work done including iron levels to check to see if she is deficient. second providing regular balanced meals at the table and involving her in meal preparation should help get her eating on track. regular physical activity is important too. but please avoid dieting and making weight an issue as research shows it backfires. for more on healthy eating during the teen years see this webmd article.
you should allow the dermatologist to treat this subungual (under the nail) wart. this is not something you can do at home because of the location and potential for damaging the sensitive nail bed. one treatment of freezing it with liquid nitrogen may not do it. it may require several treatments or the nail may have to be surgically removed in order to treat it. the problem is getting any medication to the wart itself since the nail may block direct contact. the dermatologist has many more tricks up their clinical sleeves so go back.
dear nohard but as far as i know yeast infection is heavy and tick and just like cheese. but my discharge is yellow and not tick. do you think that it is due to taking yasmin?
your first and most important step it to determine the extent of your nose injury. this may take imaging studies so i would suggest that you see a medical professional like an ent specialist so you can be properly examined and diagnosed first.
there are no particular exercises to avoid if you have fibromyalgia. aerobic exercise (running jogging) weight training water exercise and flexibility exercises can all help. golf tennis hiking and other recreational activities are also healthful. if you have other medical problems or if you're planning more than a moderate-intensity exercise program discuss your plan with your doctor before you start.
i think it is tough in that you want to balance your child's autonomy and also make sure they get the care they need. i would ask your child to sign a release of information where their counselor at college is free to contact you and disclose information. then have a discussion with therapist that you would like to be notified of future appointments (so you can push your kid to attend) and also of missed appointments. some campuses may have a support group -- the student counseling service at college might be able to direct  -- they may even run the groups.

go to the home page and type in the meds you are using read some of the comments for the thyroid med. i started it  weeks ago and feel worse on it then off of it. called my dr. stomache and nausia is the worse. but i was very anxious at first i had to cut out all caffeine which made that part better. looks like there is alot of us not liking this med. just to keep taking more meds is crazy. get one thing fixed at a time or you wont know hat med is causing what.
i have long loved the flavor and versatility of mushrooms in cooking. i was even more thrilled with these fungi (aka fun guy) when i learned of the great nutritional benefits. mushrooms have long been studied as antioxidants — literally books can be written on their nutritional benefits. suffice it to say that when its raining or snowing outside there is something beyond comfort in a bowl of mushroom soup! not only are mushrooms packed with nutrients incredible antioxidants low-cal fat-free and cholesterol-free they are delicious! my go to mushroom is a crimini aka baby bella (small portabellos). they look like the white button varieties but they are brown. they have an earthy flavor and are great in everything from salads to soups to pastas to chicken or meat dishes. you can buy them loose in bulk or already sliced for you. simply slice them thin and sauté them in a bit of extra virgin olive oil and garlic with a splash of soy sauce. the water will start to cook out of the mushrooms and you can add to a grilled chicken breast or a burger or piece of fish. by adding chopped fresh cilantro or basil at the end you can even further expand the flavors. if you are using dried mushrooms look for one that has some porcini in it. the flavor is so intense and can elevate the flavors of a recipe instantly. shiitake mushrooms are another favorite of mine. they have a distinct flavor that goes well with asian dishes. i would use a shiitake in a noodle dish that has veggies ginger garlic and soy. they are also great roasted whole and tossed with just a bit of extra virgin olive oil soy sauce and sesame seeds. then top on a steak or serve with wilted spinach as a side dish. i would not use shiitakes in an italian-style dish that has butter or cream.
yes. atopic dermatitis may affect the skin around the eyes the eyelids the eyebrows and lashes. scratching and rubbing the eye area can cause the skin to change in appearance. some people with atopic dermatitis develop an extra fold of skin under their eyes called an atopic pleat or dennie-morgan fold. other people may have hyperpigmented eyelids meaning that the skin on their eyelids darkens from the inflammation or hay fever (allergic shiners). patchy eyebrows and eyelashes may also result from scratching or rubbing. the face is very commonly affected in babies who may drool excessively and become irritated from skin contact with their flowing saliva.
i think you should get tested for stds. mucus should be tested for organisms. complete blood tests with pcrrna test need to be done to confirm the diagnosis
it is a long time to neglect these symptoms you need to see a gi and make an endoscopy. these could be stomach ulcers or upper git lesion that needs treatment 
your dermatologist will examine your skin and make an assessment for which anti-acne plan works best for you. retinoic acid may be added to your skin plan or an antibiotic. be open-minded and realistic with your expectations. sometimes it takes - different plans before you find the right one for you.
the name of the over-the-counter or prescription cough medicine would have been helpful. there are hundreds of different types. i would suggest that you call your friendly neighborhood pharmacist for advice.
this mostly is systemic disorder related to ra. esr test and rh factor can make you near the right diagnosis. also get a mri for your back if an autoimmune disorder is ruled out.
because you have multiple health problems you should stay in close contact with your health care provider while making changes. keeping your blood sugar in good control will help your triglycerides so that should be a main focus. be sure to check hemoglobin  levels to see what your average blood sugars have been. a diabetes educator can help with your diet if your blood glucose has been high. other things to do (which you may have already been doing) is reducing alcohol lowering your sugar and refined carbohydrate intake participating in regular exercise eating more fish and replacing healthy fats (olive oil/canola oil) for saturated fats (butter high fat meats etc). there is research that shows high-dose omega- supplements with docosahexaenoic acid (dha) and eicosapentaenoic acid (epa) can help lower triglycercides but you will need a doctor's prescription. best of luck to you!

we scientists don't fully understand the process of female ejaculation. it seems that some women sometimes release fluids that range from clear to white-ish during sexual excitement and/or orgasm. some women can consciously do this. others find it beyond their control. some women and their partners enjoy it and others feel bothered by it. because the fluid comes from the urethra (which is the same tube that pee passes though - just as men's ejaculate also passes through their urethra) it may feel like urine. it may even smell just a little bit like it as it does pass through the same tube. .

there is always a chance of condom breakage. you cannot get pregnant via anal sex with or without a condom. however there is a higher chance of std exposure as the walls of the anus are thinner and more fragile than the walls of the vagina and more easily permeable.

yes you most definitely need to see your doctor so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated. it would be impossible to determine the nature and significance of this lump based solely on a brief description.
as you said you have a pre-existing condition and you have recently given birth to a child. only one of these giving birth would be enough to cause this type of depression and anxiety. you however have an additional component of bipolar disorder and together this can be a very difficult time for you as i see it is. please be sure that your husband and your ob know the extent of your current anxiety and possible depression so that they can quickly help you. if you had been receiving some treatment from a psychiatrist prior to your pregnancy consider putting a call immediately in to that person. your body is experiencing a change in hormones because of the birth and we know that this will upset anyone's normal mood and anxiety levels. so it is biological and you do need some help now.
no. treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) is usually reserved for men with significant symptoms. watchful waiting with medical monitoring once a year is appropriate for most men with bph.
claritin and zyrtec are not used to treat the itching associated with a foot rash. without seeing the foot rash it is difficult to help in selecting an over-the-counter medication for treatment. the most common type of foot rash is athletes foot which is caused by a fungus. symptoms include red itching burning areas and sometimes dry white flakes. the burning itch associated with the foot rash is treated with antifungal medication. please note having an itch does not always mean that an allergy medication is going to alleviate your symptoms. medications are intended to work for the cause of a specific condition. you need to use the appropriate medication for the actual condition. seeking medical advice informing another health-care professional and asking a pharmacist about all the symptoms that are involved can help to correctly identify and treat your condition.

the swelling that you have seems to be an abscess or pus due to infection. this infection is most likely due to your tooth decay over a long period of time which has spread to bone and around your soft tissues like muscles. in the face region swelling increases rapidly in size due to multiple natural pathways that connect each other. it is a potentially dangerous situation. the abscess needs to be drained quickly. if allowed to progress then it may lead to infection spreading to brain or even may lead to breathing difficulty. i suggest you antibiotic augmentin  mg twice daily along with analgesics. contact an oral surgeon or a dentist as soon as possible for physical evaluation and take the medicine with consent. follow up and get the tooth treated once infection subsides. do warm salt water rinses and apply ice to the swelling. do not apply heat as it will spread the infection further. the probable causes:tooth infection or abscess spread to vital spaces in the face. probable diagnosis:space infection due to tooth decay. treatment plan:. abscess drainage. . antibiotics. . analgesics. . serratiopeptidase or other proteolytic enzymes. regarding follow up:for further information consult a dentist online. ---> <link>
you should monitor other family members for the signs of the flu but that does not mean that the rest of the family should stay home if they are not sick. make sure that you wash your hands frequently and cover your nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing to help reduce transmission of the virus.
you are to call your doctor. or the clinic that administered the vaccine to you. while these are not signs of an allergic reaction they may indeed be related or due to something else. unfortunately without knowing your medical history or have the ability to examine you it would be impossible for me or any medical provider to make a direct association with the vaccine or determine any other possible cause of your symptoms.
this combination medication is used to treat a variety of skin conditions (e. g. eczema fungal skin infections such as ringworm/athlete's foot/jock itch). this product contains  medications. clioquinol (also known as iodochlorhydroxyquin) is an antibiotic that works by preventing the growth of fungus/bacteria. hydrocortisone is a mild corticosteroid that works by reducing the swelling redness and itching that occurs in the affected skin. this medication should not be used in children younger than  years.

"viruses bacteria or (in rare cases) parasites or other organisms cause pneumonia. in most cases the specific organism (such as bacteria or virus) cannot be identified even with testing. when an organism is identified it is usually the bacteria streptococcus pneumoniae. many types of bacteria may cause pneumonia. pneumonia caused by mycoplasma pneumonia is sometimes mild and called ""walking pneumonia. "" viruses such as influenza a (the flu virus) and respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) can cause pneumonia. in people with impaired immune systems pneumonia may be caused by other organisms including some forms of fungi such as pneumocystis jiroveci (formally called pneumocystis carinii). this fungus frequently causes pneumonia in people who have aids. some doctors may suggest an hiv test if they think that pneumocystis jiroveci is causing the pneumonia. you may get pneumonia: after you breathe infected air particles into your lungs. after you breathe certain bacteria from your nose and throat into your lungs. this generally occurs during sleep. during or after a viral upper respiratory infection such as a cold or influenza (flu). as a complication of a viral illness such as measles or chickenpox. if you breathe large amounts of food gastric juices from the stomach or vomit into the lungs (aspiration pneumonia). this can happen when you have had a medical condition that affects your ability to swallow such as a seizure or stroke. a healthy person's nose and throat often contain bacteria or viruses that cause pneumonia. pneumonia can develop when these organisms spread to your lungs while your lungs are more likely to be infected such as during or soon after a cold or if you have a long-term (chronic) illness such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. you can get pneumonia in your daily life such as at school or work (community-associated pneumonia) or when you are in a hospital or nursing home (healthcare-associated pneumonia). treatment may differ in healthcare-associated pneumonia because bacteria causing the infection in hospitals may be different from those causing it in the community. this topic focuses on community-associated pneumonia. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated."

the right colorectal cancer treatment is based on the degree of spreading or stage: cancer that is self-contained inside a polyp can often be cured with a colonoscopy. a snare on the end of the colonoscope cuts the entire cancer out. if colorectal cancer has spread into the bowel wall surgery is needed. part or all of the colon is removed (hemicolectomy or colectomy). once the cancer has spread into the body treatment becomes more complex. it will usually involve chemotherapy or other targeted colorectal cancer treatments. as you can see the treatments get more aggressive and invasive as the cancer spreads. so colorectal cancer prevention is the name of the game.

early ejaculation is probably one of the most common sexual problems in men. depending on how you define this condition some studies have found that up to % of men suffer from premature ejaculation at some point in their lives. the exact cause of premature ejaculation is not known and treatments focus on the behavioral psychological and medical aspects. here's a lineup of some of the treatments that are available: antidepressants- some can cause a delay in ejaculation. these medications include paxil or zoloft lidocaine creams and other desensitizing creams prolong the time to ejaculation. desensitizing lubricants are available over the counter. the squeeze method developed by masters and johnsons or the stop and start technique are also employed to help with premature ejaculation and help prolong sexual activity. if premature ejaculation causes you anxiety its important to meet with a mental health counselor. seek medical help for early ejaculation since these treatments may help you but part of the treatment plan should be to have a sustained and satisfying sex life. what is ejaculation? ejaculation is the release of semen from the penis following sexual climax. when a man is sexually stimulated the brain sends signals to the genital area through nerves in the spinal cord to contract the pelvic muscles. at the start of this process waves of muscle contractions transport the sperm with a small amount of fluid from the testes through to the vas deferens. the seminal vesicles and prostate contribute extra fluid to protect the sperm. this mixture of fluid and sperm travels along the urethra to the tip of the penis where it is released (ejaculated) at the time of sexual climax (orgasm). doctormens. com you need to put your focus into your woman instead of constantly thinking and worrying about your penis. muscle programs are often activated by our thoughts so if you worry and imagine yourself ejaculating you will lose control and ejaculate. keep in mind that your conscious mind can only focus on one subject at a time. hi! i am  years old. i tried duramale after i suffered from premature ejaculation for many months. i saw the money refund policy so i decided to buy  bottles on <link> since there were no risks. i was very happy about the results even after  weeks but i followed the treatment very strict. this was my secret i guess. i recommend duramale to everyone who suffer from early orgasm. duramale pills can be purchased only online from website through credit card debit card or paypal. for complete details and best price of duramale visit <link> hi! i am  years old. premature ejaculation is more common than you think. up to % of all males experience this in their life-time. i personally overcame my issues with premature ejaculation by following these very helpful tips. if interested please click here: <link> i hope it helps you as well as it did for me.
many women suffer from ibs -- it's not clear whether it is related to menopausal hormone changes or not but it certainly is also very common as we get older. a couple of thoughts that i've learned from my friends who are gastroenterologists. have you tried a fiber-containing product like metamucil or citrucel? many gi folks recommend it and if you haven't it's probably worth a try. another product that many of them recommend for my patients is a fancy probiotic called align -- it's available over the counter and it is supposed to be an excellent bacteria for the intestines. even if you have tried other probiotics it's probably worth a try. another (and more esoteric) thought is evening primrose oil -- there are a couple of papers in the literature from many years ago touting its use in women with pms -- and i have a few patients who tell me it has helped them -- so it's probably worth a try. again finding a good gastroenterologist is a good idea to try to help get you through these episodes -- and again the local county medical society is a good starting place if you don't feel comfortable with your gi doc.

because treatment may damage healthy cells and tissues unwanted side effects are common. these side effects depend on many factors including the location of the tumor and the type and extent of the treatment. side effects may not be the same for each person and they may even change from one treatment session to the next. before treatment starts the health care team will explain possible side effects and suggest ways to help the patient manage them. surgery patients often have a headache or are uncomfortable for the first few days after surgery. however medicine can usually control their pain. patients should feel free to discuss pain relief with the doctor or nurse. it is also common for patients to feel tired or weak. the length of time it takes to recover from an operation varies for each patient. other less common problems may occur. cerebrospinal fluid or blood may build up in the brain. this swelling is called edema. the health care team monitors the patient for signs of these problems. the patient may receive steroids to help relieve swelling. a second surgery may be needed to drain the fluid. the surgeon may place a long thin tube (shunt) in a ventricle of the brain. the tube is threaded under the skin to another part of the body usually the abdomen. excess fluid is carried from the brain and drained into the abdomen. sometimes the fluid is drained into the heart instead. infection is another problem that may develop after surgery. if this happens the health care team gives the patient an antibiotic. brain surgery may damage normal tissue. brain damage can be a serious problem. the patient may have problems thinking seeing or speaking. the patient also may have personality changes or seizures. most of these problems lessen or disappear with time. but sometimes damage to the brain is permanent. the patient may need physical therapy speech therapy or occupational therapy. radiation therapy some patients have nausea for several hours after treatment. the health care team can suggest ways to help patients cope with this problem. radiation therapy also may cause patients to become very tired as treatment continues. resting is important but doctors usually advise patients to try to stay as active as they can. in addition radiation therapy commonly causes hair loss. hair usually grows back within a few months. radiation therapy also may affect the skin in the treated area. the scalp and ears may become red dry and tender. the health care team can suggest ways to relieve these problems. sometimes radiation therapy causes brain tissue to swell. patients may get a headache or feel pressure. the health care team watches for signs of this problem. they can provide medicine to reduce the discomfort. radiation sometimes kills healthy brain tissue. this side effect is called radiation necrosis. necrosis can cause headaches seizures or even the patient's death. in children radiation may damage the pituitary gland and other areas of the brain. this could cause learning problems or slow down growth and development. in addition radiation during childhood increases the risk of secondary tumors later in life. researchers are studying whether chemotherapy may be used instead of radiation therapy in young children with brain tumors. side effects may be worse if chemotherapy and radiation therapy are given at the same time. the doctor can suggest ways to ease these problems. chemotherapy the side effects of chemotherapy depend mainly on the drugs that are used. the most common side effects include fever and chills nausea and vomiting loss of appetite and weakness. some side effects may be relieved with medicine. patients who receive an implant (a wafer) that contains a drug are monitored by the health care team for signs of infection after surgery. an infection can be treated with an antibiotic.

it can be a sinus tachycardia. a sinus tachycardia is a sinus rhythm with an elevated rate of impulses defined as a rate greater than  beats per minute in an average adult. the normal resting heart rate in an average adult ranges from  to  beats per minute. there are a number of causes for a sinus tachycardia. the most common causes include anemia smoking (increased nicotine acts a stimulant) or elevated anxiety level. drugs like propranolol and clonazepam will be given to you initially for  days depending on your anxiety levels sleep cycle and habits (smoking or alcohol use). for further information consult a cardiologist online --> <link>
the issue of is it safe to have multiple procedures because they add up in length. and that does have to be taken into consideration. you do have to take into consideration the length of the operation but more importantly the nature of the operation. the reason is that liposuction for example and what we call large volume liposuction has had some percentage of significant complications due to the nature of the procedure where there is just a lot of fluid being sucked out of the body and a lot of fluid being put in for the anesthesia and frankly its a little less scientific than wed like it to be and for that reason the time element of the operation comes into play the volume comes in in other words thats a major operation and if you tack that on at the end of  hours previously with a face lift lets say its probably not always a very good idea. so again this is where common sense comes in and this is where the surgeon has to say you know you need a lot of this and maybe heres where we do have to split it up into two trips to the operating room. so all these factors have to come into play the length of the operation and the nature of the operation and the patients own particular lets say underlying their physiology how they are known to heal. if somebody says well im really a slow healer again you become a little more conservative.

keep it dark and quiet and have a routine every evening that consists of quiet time -- maybe a bath reading a book or brushing babys teeth if they have any yet. get them calm and drowsy before putting them in their crib and be consistent -- put them down the same way each time. in the middle of the night shorten your routine. you dont want baby to fall asleep while youre feeding or rocking them though because you want them to figure out how to put themselves to sleep. don't wake them if they do fall asleep especially not in the first month; its impossible to avoid falling asleep during feedings and rockings when theyre that young. but after the first month put them to sleep drowsyif theyre falling asleep when youre nursing for example stop nursing and put them to sleep. if theyre falling asleep too soon try starting your calming quiet routine sooner. also make sure they aren't overtired when you put them to bed. once babies start eating more in the daytime they dont need to wake and eat at night. but dont overfeed to encourage them to sleep through the night. some parents try to push more formula breast milk or baby food on the baby right before sleep and that can backfire. wait until they settle into a pattern where they naturally eat more in the daytime.
hardening of the arteries is a leading cause of sickness and death in the united states. in  roughly   people in this country died of cardiovascular disease largely caused by atherosclerotic problems. atherosclerosis can lead to both heart attacks and stroke. and it can also do damage to the legs kidneys and intestines. when plaque hardens and narrows arteries that supply blood to the legs they may cramp and feel weak when you walk or run. when atherosclerosis affects arteries to the kidney and intestines the inadequate blood flow can damage organ tissues.
depending on how small they are lasers can be very effective in treating spider veins. i don't recommend lasers to the external surface of the skin for treating varicose veins. there are some lasers that are done within the skin by actually cutting into the vein and eliminating it that way and those are done by specialized dermatologist or vascular surgeons. but lasers on the surface can be effective for the very small spider veins. i have found though that for most spider veins sclerotherapy which is in injecting a specific ingredient that helps eliminate those veins works much better than lasers. once you have the smallest vessels left behind laser then works very well. also for varicose veins or the spider veins on the ankles i find laser as a treatment of choice in that area.
hi there i've had that happen to me a couple times before. your period could be just late since you are stressed. do you know if you ovulated those days? if you did there is a high chance you are pregnant. i would wait a week and take a pregnancy test to make sure. good luck!

there is a drug interaction between gabapentin and hydrocodone in which when taken together the bioavailability of hydrocodone is reduced by as much as % but the bioavailability of gabapentin is increased by as much %. to avoid this interaction since you already seem to be having side effects from the gabapentin you should take the hydrocodone at least an hour before you take the gabapentin. this will allow you the pain killing effects while avoiding a major interaction. i'm not a nurse but the other answer from the nurse was incorrect in this case. when in doubt try several drug interaction checkers. they're all over the web. cheers.
yes it can be anal fissures. also you can look for a skin tag around perianal area which occurs in anal fissure. does the child have constipation or tight stools? because if it is an anal fissure then we will have to see the cause of hard stools as the difficulty to pass stool can cause fissures. he should also be checked for hypothyroidism. is there any blood in stools? most likely it is anal fissure. the rest all can be said on examination for which you should see a pediatrician. for further doubts consult a paediatrician online --><link>
"gone are the days of using corn oil. it is high in omega- fatty acids and we just get too much of that type of fat in the american diet and it competes with omega- which are the more anti-inflammatory type of fatty acid. which is where canola oil comes in. it is a made up name but the the oil comes from tiny seeds and it is a real oil that is high in monounsaturated fats and does contribute plant omega- as well. i use canola oil and olive oil in my cooking (usually canola in my baking because it has a neutral flavor). extra virgin olive oil has more of the antioxidants and phytochemicals in olives because it's from the first ""press. "" you might have heard that ""light"" olive oil is used in baking because it has more of a neutral flavor. you want to stick with extra virgin olive oil and use it anywhere the wonderful olive flavor is complimentary. olive oil has a lower ""smoke point"" than say canola oil which means it will start to break down and smoke when heated at higher temperatures. if you are doing some high temperature oven frying or pan frying use canola oil instead."
since food is the major source of infection close attention to diet is of foremost importance in the prevention of travelers' diarrhea. foods should be well-cooked and served warm. raw vegetables uncooked meat or seafood and other foods maintained at room temperature should be avoided. dairy products tap water and ice (including frozen drinks not made from filtered water) are also high-risk foods. carbonated beverages beer and wine hot coffee and tea fruits that can be peeled and canned products generally are safe. the risk for developing diarrhea increases when eating at restaurants and when purchasing food from street vendors. also frequent hand washing with soap and clean water will decrease the likelihood of the bacteria's spread.

many women do not know that over-the-counter medications can be dangerous. in fact many prescription and over-the-counter medications harm the fetus very early in pregnancy at a time that the mother does not even know she is pregnant. even aspirin use by the mother can cause defects in the fetus. for this reason as soon as pregnancy is being contemplated women should avoid all over-the-counter and prescription medications until they are reviewed with the doctor. acne medications such as isotretinoin (accutane) can cause birth defects and should be discontinued before conception. since many medications and substances can affect fetal growth and development pregnancy planning is important so that potentially harmful substances can be stopped before conceiving. unplanned pregnancy during oral contraceptive use is not felt to pose a significant danger to the fetus although deliberate use of oral contraceptives during pregnancy is not advisable. women who become pregnant during oral contraceptive use have the same risk of birth defects in their newborns as the general population of women in the range of %-%.

it is likely that an imbalance in the complex interrelated chemical reactions of the brain involving the neurotransmitters dopamine and glutamate (and possibly others) plays a role in schizophrenia. neurotransmitters are substances that allow brain cells to communicate with one another. basic knowledge about brain chemistry and its link to schizophrenia is expanding rapidly and is a promising area of research.
hi a lot would depend on this you say he touched your hole with his penis was this before oral sex or after did you take him all the way to ejaculation with oral? if he touched your whole then there could have been some transfer of sperm but it would be an outside chance of you getting pregnant. but then you have done the right thing by taken plan b. so with this i think its best you wait till you have your period if you do give a big sigh. but then you get yourself on bc but not depo shot just google depo shot side effects to see why. do hope this helps. good luck

most helpful answer no i don't think you could physically have sex long enough without stopping to occasionally eat to become low in iron (anemia). sexual contact will not adversely affect iron levels so if you are anemic it would be important for you and your medical provider to determine why. is your diet deficient in iron? do you have a familial or genetic form of anemia? are you having problems with excessive bleeding / blood loss?

i'm sorry to hear you have arthritis. it's certainly a very common ailment. i guess i'm going to assume you're referring to osteoarthritis which is the wear-and-tear disease that makes the joints hurt. this type of arthritis frequently comes on as we get older. just to be clear there's another type of arthritis called rheumatoid arthritis that is an autoimmune disease. but based on your question i'm thinking you're referring to plain old arthritis that hurts worse when the weather gets colder. if that's the case moving from connecticut to virginia probably won't help. while it's true coldness can make the pain of osteoarthritis feel worse virginia probably isn't sufficiently warmer than connecticut in the winter to make much of a difference. now if you were talking about becoming a snowbird and flying down to florida to spend your winters then i'd probably say that's a fine idea. it's also important to take into consideration where your support system resides. when your arthritis symptoms become so severe you need help with daily or periodic tasks you need to be living where your family and friends are close enough to help you. if that's in new england then that's probably not a bad place for you to stay. i hope this helps! i've lived in va all my life and have osteo lupus and fibro. while it is warmer here in the winter than ct we do get some winters that are fairly cold - it does vary considerably and it varies a lot depending on where you live in va. another thing to weigh in is the heat and humidity - most of va especially the central and eastern half - is quite humid and is very hot in the summer. it's not unusual for it to start going into the 's in late april and stay in that range until well into october. this summer we had long stretches of days in the high 's - low 's with humidity in the -% range - and the combination of heat and humidity is particularly brutal especially if your arthritis causes compression of your c-spine nerves and you have a problem with sweating and body temp regulation because of it and/or if you are prone to migraines and sinus issues. the hot humid weather makes me far more miserable than the coldest days ever do and the older i get the less i seem able to tolerate it. so that's something to bear in mind when you consider moving here. (and please don't get me wrong i love my home state and am proud to be a virginian! )

those little bumps may be absolutely nothing. it is not unusual for men to have these tiny innocent papules. keep in mind that this is just a guess since i have no way of examining you. to be sure you can see a medical provider for an examination. these are called fordyce spots. most men have them and they are absolutely nothing to worry about. however dry skin is very common down there so you might want to think about using a penis skin moisturizer. i use one called  man oil and it keeps my skin in great shape. my girlfriend loves it. hope this helps and good luck.

while serious complications do not occur frequently it is possible for sinus infection to cause a direct extension of infection into the brain through a sinus wall creating a life-threatening emergency (for example meningitis or brain abscess). in addition other adjacent structures can become infected and develop problems such as osteomyelitis of bones in the skull and infection around the eye (orbital cellulitis).
if you received your flu vaccine in october then it was this season's vaccine so you are protected for the entire flu season.
no diabetic neuropathy typically affects the toes first then gradually affects the foot ankle then shins etc. it has to do with the nerves in the legs being the longest and therefore receiving the greatest cumulative effect of lost nerve conduction caused by chronically elevated blood sugar levels. the sensitivity in the nerve of the tooth usually indicates a dental problem so a dentist is the one to see about it. people with diabetes are at increased risk for dental problems mostly because of the negative effect of chronically elevated blood sugar levels on the immunity. the white blood cell response to oral bacteria is weakened by the high blood sugar and dental infections become more likely.
sorry your split skin just sea wash it twice a day till it heals use no creams or lotions it will slowly get better. good luck
grapefruit juice contains enzymes that can interact with certain medications like simvastatin by slowing down your bodys ability to metabolize them. this means it will take longer for your body to get rid of the simvastatin when you drink grapefruit juice which can potentially lead to having too much simvastatin in your body. this can lead to more side effects like muscle pains. this interaction does not happen with all the statins. for instance there is no interaction between grapefruit juice and pravastatin found in pravachol.

"you do need to be re-examined but not at the er. you should try and see an ent specialist or at least a primary care provider in their office. the er is really not the right place to properly diagnose and manage these things. while the er is great when you have life-threatening true emergency things like ear infections (or possible ear infections) are often triaged low in priority and quickly ""treated and streeted"". i don't know if you were misdiagnosed or not but have seen numerous misdiagnoses come from those quick er examinations. yes you could have been misdiagnosed or improperly treated. since eardrops are not the treatment for middle ear infections (unless you have an eardrum rupture or have tubes) i am suspicious when i see both an oral and an eardrop prescribed. i call this ""shotgun treatment"". the antibiotic may not have been proper or the correct dose or not needed at all (if you really didn't have a middle ear infection). you could have an eustachian tube problem in which case the antibiotic or ear drop would not help. skip the er. go directly an ent if you can or at least see a primary care medical provider who will spend more time with you and get to the bottom of this ear issue. yes go to ent. sometimes i get what sounds like the same thing. the ent does something with tubes and i drink some water and say kkkkk. sounds like witch dr. stuff eh? but it works and i think it kind of blows fluid out of the inner ear. the e. tube in my ear is very narrow so they say and does block up at times. sometimes chewing hard gum like bubble will clear it temporarily. see the ent it is so worth it. my husband lost the hearing in his right ear over the course of  hours last february. we have since learned that he should have had treatment with prednisone immediately and he might have had the chance to save his hearing. this is a sensorineural loss and it must be treated as a medical emergency. insist on being treated immediately you have your hearing to lose. thanks rod for your reply. at first i did try to contact my primary but earliest i could get an appointment would be february. in order to see a specialist i would need a referral and my insurance does not cover urgent care centers either. that is why i ended up going to the er. i'm going out of state tonight and wouldn't be able to do anything till i get back in over a week. i'm just concerned and the er would be my only option at this point."
yes a person can have more than one viral infection at the same time. true influenza is so miserable that how would you even know if you also had a common cold? diagnosed early and by laboratory confirmation (there is a rapid flu test) the course of influenza can be shortened by using a drug called tamiflu. colds of course have no specific treatment. they will last about a week.

find out whether you need malaria prevention. before you travel talk with your prescriber about your travel plans to determine whether you need to take medicine to prevent malaria. even in countries where malaria is present there may be areas of the country that are free of malaria. in general malaria is more common in rural (country) areas than in big cities and it is more common during rainy seasons when mosquitoes are most common. you can get information about the areas of the world where malaria occurs from the cdc and from local authorities in the countries you visit. if possible plan your travel to reduce the risk of malaria. take medicine to prevent malaria infection. without malaria prevention medicine you have a higher risk of getting malaria. malaria starts with flu-like symptoms such as chills fever muscle pains and headaches. however malaria can make you very sick or cause death if you don't seek medical help immediately. these symptoms may disappear for a while and you may think you are well. but the symptoms return later and then it may be too late for successful treatment. malaria can cause confusion coma and seizures. it can cause kidney failure breathing problems and severe damage to red blood cells. however malaria can be easily diagnosed with a blood test and if caught in time can be effectively treated. if you get flu-like symptoms (chills fever muscle pains or headaches) after you return from a malaria area get medical help right away and tell your health care provider that you may have been exposed to malaria. people who have lived for many years in areas with malaria may have some immunity to malaria (they do not get it as easily) and may not take malaria prevention medicine. this does not mean that you don't need to take malaria prevention medicine. protect against mosquito bites. medicines do not always completely prevent your catching malaria from mosquito bites. so protect yourself very well against mosquitoes. cover your skin with long sleeves and long pants and use mosquito repellent and bednets while in malaria areas. if you are out in the bush you may want to pre-wash your clothes with permethrin. this is a mosquito repellent that may be effective for weeks after use. ask your prescriber for other ways to protect yourself.

hi. rased igg levels suggest you have an ongoing infection somewhere in your body. some infections are not detected by routine blood tests. but you seem to have undergone almost all non invasive tests and seen to be negative. one test that can definitely confirm whats wrong is the muscle biopsy. histopathology of muscle will rule out any muscle specific pathology. thanks

if your partner has hiv then you should be worried. if you have no idea of your partner's hiv status then you need to seriously re-evaluate your risky sexual practices. condoms do protect from hiv if used properly. hiv is more likely to be transmitted anally than orally. if you are having stranger sex it would be best for you to be tested. and tested again on a regular basis.
your doctor will probably prescribe several medicines after you have had a transient ischemic attack (tia). medicines to prevent blood clots are typically used because blood clots can cause tias and strokes. the types of medicines that prevent clotting are: antiplatelet medicines. anticoagulant medicines. cholesterol -lowering and blood pressure -lowering medicines are also used to prevent tias and strokes. antiplatelet medicines antiplatelets (such as aspirin aspirin with extended-release dipyridamole or clopidogrel ) keep platelets in the blood from sticking together. aspirin is most often used to prevent tias and strokes. many studies have shown that aspirin helps prevent strokes and reduces the risk of another tia in people who have had their first tia. other antiplatelet medicines (such as clopidogrel) may be used for people who cannot take aspirin or for whom aspirin has not been effective. aggrenox a medicine that combines aspirin with dipyridamole is a safe and effective alternative to aspirin to prevent tia and stroke for some people.  anticoagulants anticoagulants prevent the production of certain proteins that are needed for blood to clot. if you have atrial fibrillation you will probably take an anticoagulant (such as warfarin ). anticoagulants are more effective than antiplatelets in preventing strokes in people with atrial fibrillation.  both anticoagulants and antiplatelets increase the risk of bleeding. warfarin (such as coumadin ) has the highest risk of bleeding problems but the risk is lower when the dosage is closely monitored. if you take warfarin don't suddenly change your intake of foods that are rich in vitamin k. vitamin k can interfere with the action of anticoagulants making it more likely that your blood will clot. for more information see: anticoagulants: vitamin k and your diet. cholesterol-lowering medicines experts recommend that most people who have had a tia take statins which lower cholesterol. many studies show that statins significantly reduce the risk of stroke in people who have had a tia. statins even protect against stroke in people who do not have heart disease or high cholesterol.  for more information on these medicines see the topic high cholesterol. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

"although ""yeast"" is the name most women think of when they think of vaginal infections bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common type of vaginal infection in women of reproductive age. bv is caused by a combination of several bacteria. these bacteria seem to overgrow in much the same way as do candida when the vaginal balance is upset. the exact reason for this overgrowth is not known."

i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. facial pain can be very uncomfortable. i'd suggest you see a health care provider to get this checked out. a number of conditions can cause the symptoms you describe including temporomandibular joint disorders (tmj or tmd) trigeminal neuralgia (tn) or even an abscessed tooth. i can also think of several other possibilities which is why you need to undergo a physical exam and perhaps some other testing to figure out what's causing this problem. some of these conditions are more prevalent among certain age groups or in women versus men. if the pain doesn't clear up within a few days i'd suggest you call your primary care physician for an appointment. i hope you feel better soon! you have to take pain medication the good medication for you is
in my opinion you either miscarriage uterine fibroids or endometriosis i recommend you see a gynaecologist good luck
maybe so but not likely. if any pregnancy occurs it is very possible that it's caught in the tubes in which case would cause a surgical procedure to occur; if this were to happen it is dangerous to the mother. anyway there have been cases where women in their 's give childbirth but it is one thing to give life and another to nurture it-

i am a cna that works at an independent living apartment complex for age group - (just celebrated a  birthday there) many of my people are not far off from being put on hospice. some get depressed for a bit and others look at it as a blessing. in my experience the persons age has alot to do with how much anxiety is shown. one commonality is they all have such great attitudes about living and seeing what the future holds. the 'anxiety' is most definitely present at the beginning. most of them want to make the most out of the time they have left leaving out any treatments that will cause them to be bed bound or will slow them down in anyway. i think the sooner a person comes to terms with their condition and lives to the fullest of their capabilities anxiety will ease.
"a ct scan  is a technique in which multiple x-rays of the body are taken from different angles in a very short period of time. these images are collected by a computer to give a series of images that look like ""slices"" of the body. in diagnosing dementia ct scans can reveal tumors and small strokes in the brain."
divorce isn't just the end of an official contract; it is a legal surgery that separates two people whose lives have been joined. particularly after long marriages it is painful and traumatic and people need time to heal afterward. moving on in a healthy way — healing from the pain of divorce — requires that you feel the pain. otherwise you are just covering a wound that is likely to fester under the surface demanding attention at some later time. so it is important to allow yourself to feel the hurt anger sadness or whatever other emotional distress that your divorce inflicts upon you. then you can actively take steps forward toward a happier future. at some point you will likely want to date again. hopefully at this point you will have a life filled with many things and people that you enjoy. also if you know what you are looking for in a person (i. e. respectful partner someone to go hiking with) and relationship (i. e. just fun long term commitment) then you are more likely to find it; and feel fulfilled by it. knowing what you want is also very important when you have children. consider your child's age and personality as you decide how to proceed. consider how much you want him or her exposed to your dating life. you will probably want to shelter them a bit from your exploration as each new date might unrealistically be seen as a possible threat (i. e. taking your attention dashing hopes of reconciliation with your ex-spouse) or savior (i. e. joining the family to once again make it complete). where can you meet people? how can you go about this? while it's not easy it's not impossible either. your attitude is critical. being happy hopeful and open to meeting someone can help you. because dating can be a bumpy road a positive attitude can also help you to bounce along without feeling too bruised. here are some concrete suggestions for finding a partner: ) let people know that you are interested in dating; you might be surprised who can set you up with someone and who that someone might be (hopefully the partner of your dreams though you must also be prepared for the date of your nightmares). ) join activities or clubs that interest you; then you will be happy with what you are doing whether or not you meet a special someone. ) find out about singles activities and try some out. ) try online dating services. there are many of them; just a few popular ones are as match. com eharmony. com perfectmatch. com and lavalife. com
i was on depo many years ago and i remember it takeing more than a year and the doctor will also tell you this unlike pills or patches depo is strong stuff the best way to see if your fertile is to try a opk witch will test your ovulation you can get them in the pharmacy also chart down your bbt take your temp every morning before you get out of bed right after you ovulate your temp should go up alittle but a few points of a degree but in the case of depo it may take some time. i would look into going online and buying the bulk sets they have on amazan for example read the reviews and make the choice that best fits your and your budget. if your ttc it may be a good idea for you to buy the set of ovulation and hpt together its a great deal. also the directions are a bit different from the kind you would buy at the pharmacy so do your homework before buying something you dont fully understand. i really hoped this helped you and dont sweat if it takes a while to get normal again i was on depo for more than  years and got prego with my son whos now  a year and  months after stoping <positive_smiley> good luck hope everything turns out good.
it sounds like you have your work cut out for you! but the good news is that there are many good-tasting healthy foods that will fit the bill. you should start with some good basic gluten free recipes-like the ones found in our gluten-free recipes directory. look them over and pick the ones that do not contain meat. and start cooking! there are many types of vegetarian diets—ones that include eggs and dairy –or vegan options that do not include any animal products at all. if you choose ovo-lacto (eggs and dairy) vegetarianism just be sure to use only low-fat dairy in your cooking. eggs can be part of a healthy low fat diet—just dont go overboard. it is the yolk that has the cholesterol. so switch to the egg whites whenever you can. and you can use olive oil as a healthier alternative to the animal fats. if you are changing your diet because of health issues such as heart disease diabetes celiac disease or high cholesterol talk to a dietitian. they are a wealth of information. many insurance companies will even help cover the visit. detailed information about a gluten-free diet is also available at the celiac disease foundation website <link> also make sure you talk to your doctor before starting any new diet. there are several recipes that can be found on the webmd website. i have included links to gluten free recipes and vegetarian recipes. when looking at the ingredients of a recipe feel free to alter to fit within your diet regimen. i have also included a link about the tlc diet (therapeutic lifestyle changes) to help you choose foods that are lower in cholesterol.
hi the bacteria are resistent to clindamycin (this is not a regularly used medicine for oral infections). novaclox augmentin etc are the drugs we generally use. taking wrong antibiotics can help the bacteria grow even more and may land you in trouble. get the abscess drained change the antibiotic. iv antibiotics are better than oral ones. thanks
many pediatricians still recommend waiting until your baby is a bit older --  or  months -- before offering allergenic foods such as milk eggs peanuts tree nuts (such as walnuts or almonds) fish shellfish soy and wheat. even if theres no added risk of causing an allergy they note that an allergic reaction may be easier to manage in an older baby. and some pediatricians concerned about the particular severity of allergic reactions to peanuts and shellfish still suggest staying away from them until your child is up to  years old. whole cow's milk should not be given to babies younger than  year old because the proteins in whole milk can irritate the stomach. yogurt and soft cheeses are fine however because the proteins in these dairy products are broken down and less likely to cause tummy trouble. you should also still wait until at least  – some experts say  -- to introduce honey which can cause a potentially serious disease called infant botulism.
hi you just have to admit that you and alcohol just do not mix as its giving you these problems so you either just keep well away from alcohol and bars or if you must just drink fruit juices and do tell your buddies that its giving you a problem so don't mix my drinks as its not funny. but your not alone when it comes to alcohol problems and what is above is how you have to now live your life going this way gives you a trouble free life. do hope this helps you. good luck
cord blood is the blood thats left in the umbilical cord and placenta after birth. it can be rich in stem cells — cells that have the potential to develop into many different body tissues. in an emerging field of research and therapeutics cord blood has been used successfully to treat a number of diseases including cancer diabetes metabolic disorders and rare genetic syndromes. non-profit and government agencies are organizing public banks similar to blood banks for families to donate the cord blood at no cost so that everyone in need can find cord blood that matches. competing with these public banks are private companies trying to convince parents to pay thousands of dollars to bank the cord blood only for themselves. their web sites often contain misinformation half-truths and marketing pressure thats designed not to help your familys health but to get the money out of your familys wallet. what you wont hear from the private banks: it is very unlikely that your privately banked cord blood will ever be used by anyone. even if your baby ends up needing a cord blood transplant hell may well need someone elses cord blood — not his own. even if by some remarkable chance your baby needs his own cord blood many of the collected samples are not suitable for use. no tests will be done to determine if the cord blood collected is usable until the blood is retrieved. you may have paid thousands up front plus a substantial year fee to store well nothing at all.
this site is a medical site you must be sick if you posting your question here? and keep posting the only people who read these are us who answer them. a very limited audience.
yes
this is an interesting question and i'm glad you asked it. in order to develop an allergy to a substance you have to be exposed to it. in other words it's extremely rare to experience an allergic reaction to something on first exposure. (it's not impossible but it's fairly rare. ) one good example is penicillin. millions of people took penicillin as children and suffered no ill effects. many of those people today have penicillin allergies. that early exposure caused their bodies to mount an extreme immune reaction to penicillin later on. that could be what happened to you too. if a physician confirmed your allergy you need to take it to heart. allergies not only can come on later in life they can get worse over time. so that diarrhea from eating eggs today could turn into anaphylaxis eventually. you also should be aware that people with a documented egg allergy may be discouraged from getting flu shots. i'd suggest you talk with your health care provider to see if this restriction applies to you. sorry you're going through this. it's difficult to give up a well-loved food.
hi any discharge from the vagina you should go see your doctor it would be best for you. good luck
"baby teeth are typically much whiter than the adult teeth. it is typically disheartening for parents when they see the adult teeth come out and they are more yellow. my own son is  years old and he is getting his front adult teeth. they are more yellow than the baby teeth. however they are perfectly fine and there is nothing wrong with them. the best thing to do is to go to the dentist and make sure that everything is developing properly. let all the adult teeth come out and only when your child reaches the age of maturity do we ""do"" anything about it. our society is preoccupied with ""toilet bowl"" white teeth. teeth are naturally ivory in color. ivory is not white! just make sure that your child is developing properly and don't worry about the color."
head lice are really uncomfortable to see. i think most parents go through this at some point with their kids going to school and the only way to find it is to really look very closely at your child's scalp. so in school it's very hard for these children not to have contact with each other share brushes hats scarves and that's really how it's spread. so as much as possible if you can instruct your kid not to share these products with their friends that would be a great start and a great way to prevent it. but beyond that you just have to examine your child's scalp very closely. what you will typically find rather than the active lice is nits. what nits look like they really look like flakes of dandruff except that when you try to remove it it won't come off the hair because what the lice do the nits are the eggs from the lice that will hatch within a week or so so what the lice do is they create this little capsule and they glue it to the hair and that's how it sticks. so it's very hard to take it off. the problem is i have parents come in and they say well but my child would shampoo their scalp everyday. and that makes it worse because when the hair is that clean the glue sticks better. so you are almost better off having a greasy scalp because it's harder for that nit to stick to the scalp. so it's not a matter of cleanliness at all. but once those nits are attached to the scalp you really have to get a prescription treatment to help get rid of it. there is a prescription called ovide that you put on to the scalp leave it on for a few hours and then shampoo it out and repeat it in a week to get rid of any nits that might have hatched by then.
perimenopause is the  to  years prior to menopause. menopause is the cessation of your period for more than a year but perimenopausal women are still bleeding. they are having irregular cycles. they may be bleeding heavily they may be bleeding lightly very irregularly or very frequently but it is before the menopause. so the average age of perimenopause is about  whereas the average age of menopause is about . but women think that it's. i'm going through menopause when i have hot flashes and all that stuff. that's incorrect. you're going through perimenopause when you have that right.  percent of women have hot flashes during perimenopause. and it seems that once you go a full year without a period and you're now entering your post menopausal years your symptoms should improve.
no.
you need to see an orthopedic surgeon.
it sounds like this may have happened when they removed the tape. it should go away after a few days. if it doesn't let your doctor know.
i'm sorry you're experiencing this. i don't know what's causing this situation but i'd have it checked out if i were you especially because you obviously have concerns about it (i would too). it could be something minor but then again you may have injured that delicate tissue somehow. if that's the case a gynecologist can tell you if it needs to be treated. i'd recommend calling today for an appointment with your gyn to find out what's going on. i wish you all the best!
it's starting to come back in vogue to utilize a slow cooker or crock pot. in general i am someone who likes to get great healthy food on the table fast. i dont always do well with things that are slow. however the amount of time it takes to prepare ingredients for the slow cooker is fast and i like that you dont have to think about it again until its time to eat. here are some tips on ways to revitalize flavor reverse bad past crock-pot experiences and have a healthy savory meal that is not an overcooked pile of mush. the first and most important tip to having a delicious crock pot meal is to choose the right type of ingredients. this is where you should utilize ingredients that take longer to cook like traditionally tough cuts of meat. these include brisket pork butt or an entire chicken. (by the way these are traditionally less expensive meats. so if you are trying to budget for meals this is a great way to help with that — or if you are trying to budget for organic ingredients this is where you can upgrade to organic or natural cuts of meat. ). when cooked for so many hours these tougher meats taste great and fall off the bone easily. and you get the added benefit of pulling nutrients from the bone. if youve had a bad experience with a crock pot most likely youve participated in the biggest mistake: do not use canned vegetables in a slow cooker. period. ever. using canned vegetables in a crock pot recipe will simply turn your meal into a vegetable smoothie. canned vegetables are already overcooked when they are put in the can. cooking them for another - hours will disintegrate them. potatoes carrot onions and other firm veggies do well in a slow cooker. using canned tomatoes is fine — mostly because you will probably be using them in a sauce so they hold up well. absolute no-nos: canned green beans canned corn and canned peas. actually let me go ahead and advise you to never use these canned vegetables if you can help it. under-seasoning is another mistake i see people make all the time. since the food is cooking there for so long — the equivalent of a long slow boil — there needs to be a few levels of flavors. there are a couple ways to do this. if you are making a meat or bean dish i suggest sautéing savories like onions shallots or garlic in extra virgin olive oil first before you put in the crock pot. the flavors seep into the oil better if you take this extra step. also add fresh-cut herbs at the very end or a squeeze of lemon or lime to brighten up the dish and give fresh flavor quickly. add ingredients that are high in flavor. for example fire-roasted tomatoes or fire-roasted chilies. another tip is that adding a half piece of bacon cut into small pieces will add tons of flavor without all the fat. a half piece of bacon has about .  grams of fat depending on the size. not bad for adding another dimension of smoky delicious flavor. can you tell im a fan of bacon? here are some easy crock pot tips for the ultimate chicken soup. take an entire chicken quartered and bone in cover with enough water to cover the chicken. for every four cups of water throw in a - inch piece of ginger root and about  whole garlic cloves. then add carrots celery and onions and cook for eight hours on the low setting or four hours on high. at the end add fresh cut parsley and a squeeze of fresh lemon. the slow cooker pulls out the flavor in this traditional soup in ways that you wouldnt experience if it was cooked quickly. and not only do you get the nutrition in the bones but the chicken falling off the bone. you can also use the slow cooker for a healthy delicious breakfast. throw in steel cut oats and water and about a teaspoon of cinnamon and slow cook over night. you can also add dried fruits like apples or apricots — these will rehydrate and add great nutrition and flavor. yes its slow but worth the wait. enjoy the delicious benefits of your crock pot while winter is upon us. i want to see crock pot what it looks like most foods that are cooked in hard bottom in covered pot can be cooked fast with high heat according the type of food

based on what you have shared as being the whole truth and nothing but the truth you are not at risk other than the fact that your current sexual practice has a way of escalating over time. be very very careful. dry humping as you call it has a way of progressing to riskier sexual play.
we are used to thinking about the telltale signs of heart attacks based upon many years of research and clinical observation of what men have experienced -- chest discomfort arm and back pain and shortness of breath top the list. but more recently doctors and their patients are recognizing that women may experience heart attacks differently. women may certainly experience chest pain but they should also be on the lookout for less obvious symptoms like nausea indigestion and palpitations in addition to shortness of breath and back pain. in fact nearly half of the women in one study had no chest pain at all during their heart attack. fatigue and shortness of breath were the most common symptoms. whereas chest pain shortness of breath and fatigue are the most typical symptoms for men these heart attack warning signs for women should be considered carefully.
yes you could have a sinus infection. symptoms can vary from person to person but some of the symptoms that you mentioned in your question are often seen in sinus infection. many sinus infections are viral and will be self-limiting in a weeks or so but some can be bacterial and require medical intervention like antibiotics. in order for you to be properly diagnosed and treated you will need to see a health care professional for a examination first
mania? i think that would be a stretch to call anger outbursts a mania at this point. there are many reasons why someone would be edgy. anger easily over little things. but unfortunately it may take a bit of investigation to be able to determine any underlying reason(s). seeing a counselor may be the best place to start.
yes this is a classic example of how a vitamin or supplement can effect a prescription medication. the calcium citrate inhibits the absorption of the levothroid which means your body will not get the dose of the thyroid medication it needs. this can lead to hypothyroidism. i suggest taking your levothroid in the morning and the calcium citrate in the afternoon to avoid this interaction. if you have any questions about medications talk to your pharmacist we are happy to help.
i to am bipolar  my dr. said that bipolar  jusst means that i am more on the deppressive side on the upper side for the most part. i don't think that anything a friend does brings it on its just something that we batte. medication is the only thing that helps. and maybe a friend to be there for you to just listen. cougar
she most likely has a second-degree burn (i can't see it of course). a third degree burn is so deep the skin become black and it tends to be painless. a second-degree burn is most likely from a scald. a prescription burn ointment called silvadene is definitely superior to petroleum jelly and she may need some pain medication. she could call her regular doctor.
aging spots or solar lentigos primarily result from sun damage. age spots have also been mislabeled as liver spots. (they do not have any correlation with liver disease. ) the majority of age spots are benign (noncancerous). if you notice any changes in the border color or diameter of any lesions on your skin you should be evaluated by your dermatologist.
it would depend on which cold medicine you were taking and if it also contained an antihistamine. you would not want to take two antihistamines. i would need to know the name of the medications you are referring to in order to give you proper advice. i suggest you check with your pharmacist.

sure you can quit taking premarin (estrogen replacement) if you'd like. be prepared for a potential onslaught of menopause symptoms if you do so. among the symptoms you might experience if you stop taking estrogen are: hot flashes (sometimes called hot flushes) irritability vaginal dryness night sweats i don't list those to try to sway you against going off the estrogen. i only list them so you don't get caught off-guard. i'd recommend talking to your doctor about ways to taper off the estrogen gradually in order to minimize possible side effects. your doctor also will be a valuable source of information regarding both the benefits and the risks of hormone replacement therapy (hrt ) for you given your unique medical history. best wishes to you!
"self-diagnosis is often wrong and self-treatment can be iffy. since i have no way of determining if this is indeed a wart i cannot endorse home treatment. besides over the counter wart medications cannot be use inside the mouth and should be used cautiously on the face. my advise would be for you to see a medical provider and have this ""wart"" professionally treated."
if your baby is gaining weight (usually by age two weeks they should be the same since they tend to lose a bit right after delivery or a bit higher than their birth weight) you may be making more milk than you realize. if your baby is pooping and peeing gaining weight chances are that you are producing enough. if your baby seems hungry after breast feeding on both sides and is not gaining weight contact a lactation consultant (often at the hospital where you may have delivered) or via your baby's pediatrician.
"this will be a temporary phase. she is just craving extra attention and longs for the attention afforded to babies. relapses in using a potty is not uncommon but make her change her own diapers! buy some very cute panties with her favorite movie characters but don't let her wear them until she is using the toilet again. girls love clothes and this will allow her to make choices. get her a newborn doll and a good supply of accessories so she can be a little mother and care for this baby. keep reminding her that she is a big girl now and not a baby. when going to the store ask if any ""big girls"" would like to go? babies are not allowed; just big girls. she will stop this play so just hang in there."
yes. you need a medical evaluation. you may have had trauma to your kidney or bladder. save money some other ways but do not avoid seeking a proper medical evaluationj for abdominal discomfort and hematuria.
very little still see a doctor though because if you aren't pregnant you may still have another health concern.
hi you are under lot of anxiety. you need adequate counselling and psychiatry consultation. to rule out any organic pathology you should get your detailed blood investigations done. thanks
we hear in the news and in commercials that plant sterols are good for us and lower cholesterol levels. we are even fortifying certain foods and some baby aspirin with these phytosterols. yet these phytosterols may be more atherogenic (have the ability to initiate or accelerate atherogenesis — formation of fat deposits on the inner lining of blood vessels) than cholesterol in certain groups of people. stanols on the other hand are good for everyone and do lower cholesterol levels. lets start with some definitions: * cholesterol is a sterol. a sterol is a steroid with an alcohol group attached to it. * stanols are saturated or reduced sterols that are similar to cholesterol but have a methyl or an ethyl group attached to them. this difference minimizes stanol absorption in the intestines. * cholestanol is a stanol. cholesterol can be broken down by the liver into cholestanol and thus is a by-product of cholesterol metabolism. if sterols or stanols are esterified (combined with fatty acids) then they can be incorporated into margarine. we consume many sterols from plant sources (sitosterol campesterol and stigmasterol) shellfish (desmosterol and fucosterol) and animal sources (cholesterol). all of these sterols with the exception of cholesterol are collectively referred to as noncholesterol sterols. collectively these sterols can be called phytosterols. sitosterol represents about % of all noncholesterol sterols in the diet and is the most well known noncholesterol sterol in the diet. when fats (triglycerides) enter the intestine in our food they are broken down into their basic building blocks. the main breakdown products are called fatty acids. these fatty acids and sterols from dietary sources are packaged into what is called a micelle. these micelles ferry these fatty acids and sterols to the intestinal lining (epithelium). they are then absorbed by passive diffusion into the intestinal cells. passive diffusion is a biological principle that substances flow through a semi-permeable tissue from an area of higher concentration to an area of lesser concentration. there is no pump required to get them out of the intestine and ultimately into the bloodstream. most humans absorb about % of sterols in the intestines. however there are some people who are what is termed hyperabsorbers (they absorb -%) and some are hypoabsorbers (they absorb less than %). noncholesterol sterols are not esterified as humans do not have the enzymes necessary for that. when these unesterified sterols get into an arterial wall they are more atherogenic than cholesterol (an esterified sterol). this means they have a greater artery clogging potential than does cholesterol. if one lacks these transporters (homozygote) all sterols are absorbed and none are pumped back out: this is a very rare homozygous condition leading to the disease called sitosterolemia or phytosterolemia. it is associated with severe atherosclerosis as noncholesterol sterols (which cannot be esterified) are more atherogenic than cholesterol. heterozygotes people who have some transporter function eliminate some but not all of these phytosterols. stanols do not require these transporters to get back into these intestines. this is the reason that they are safe and effective to reduce cholesterol. stanols are commercially available in the supermarket in a product called benecol. in summary noncholesterol sterols serve no physiologic function in man. all sterols are atherogenic if they accumulate in the arterial wall. stanols are saturated sterols. they are not absorbed and can be used therapeutically to reduce cholesterol absorption from the intestine.
"this is an issue that only your urologist can (or should answer). anytime that you see blood in the toilet it can only be from about two sources: the urine or the bowels. since you recently had surgery for kidney stones you are likely to form more so another ct scan of the kidney may be in your future especially since you are in pain. even tiny kidneys stones can cause severe pain if they are lodge in the ureter so it would be best not to ignore these symptoms and consult your urologist. if you cannot see your urologist quickly then an emergency room visit is appropriate. they will most likely order an immediate ct scan of the kidney with your history and symptoms. i have ""been there and done that"" (stent and all) so my heart goes out to you. it feels as if it is trying to pass my stone in the last  "" in my ureter. when attempting to squeeze out the last amount of urine it hurt a bit and some blood came out. is this normal during the passing process?"
fnac is fine needl aspiration cytology in which usually a tumor or growth is punctured with a syringe and obtained material is spread on slide to see under microscope the histology or cells of the tumor. your reault has shown some abnormal cells which is suspected of having cancer in that growth and its advised to confirm it by doing core biopsy in which some of the tissue is taken and then slides are made to study the tissue of the tumor.
arthritis sufferers include men and women children and adults. approximately  million people worldwide have arthritis. nearly  million people in the united states are affected by arthritis including over a quarter million children! more than  million americans have osteoarthritis. approximately .  million americans suffer from rheumatoid arthritis. more than half of those with arthritis are under  years of age. nearly % of americans with arthritis are women.
i just turned  and am now  years post emergency bypass surgery. if you are perfectly comfortable playing squash with your heart rate that high not out of breath not breathing hard or panting no chest pain then you simply have fantastic fitness. its a whole body activity utilizing legs and tush as you move about the floor and back and ab muscles as you lean in all directions to move for the ball and start and stop. just be sure you eat a very healthy diet plenty of anti-oxidant rich foods every day and keep a lid on saturated fats in the diet. with a bad diet your heart can develop an alternative capillary network that feeds it as major arteries become blocked from bad diet with good exercise. this does not happen to every one but i have this and i know of a fellow about  miles away who does also. he also recently had bypass surgery.
"i can see why it might sound logical that calcium supplementation could help broken bones heal faster. after all bones are made of calcium right? so feeding them calcium should speed up healing. unfortunately that's not how it works. unless you have a pre-existing calcium deficiency (not likely in an otherwise healthy -year-old boy) taking calcium will not help your bones heal. the process of bone healing is called ""remodeling. "" your body removes dead bone cells and builds new ones in their place. this process occurs on a pretty predictable schedule. for common fractures like the one you describe the remodeling process normally takes  to  weeks. unfortunately your son will just have to wait this out. what will help the bones heal on schedule is not engaging in activities that put stress on the areas of the fracture. resting the hand (to keep the fractures stable) will allow the body to do its remodeling job and get the bones back to normal. wishing you well! this answer is true. most fractures especially of bigger bones will take  to  weeks. smaller bones like those of the fingers and/or wrist will only take - weeks. just gotta baby them. the body is made to heal itself. just let it"
baby : your baby measures about  inches long from head to toe and weighs about .  pounds. rather than hearing vibrations baby's nerve endings in his ears are connected now so that he can hear distinct sounds like familiar voices and music. mom-to-be : your uterus now fills a large part of your abdomen and you've probably gained between  and  pounds. you're probably feeling increasing excitement and anxiousness about the birth; it won't be long now. tip for the week : practice your breathing and relaxation exercises.

"i have never heard of a medical condition called a ""shocked liver"" so it would be best to get your true diagnosis from your medical provider. since every person is different when it comes to hepatic abnormalities it would be best to get patient-specific recommendations from your medical provider -- someone who knows your lab results and your case."
"personally i think those ""testosterone boosters"" are worthless but you have to make your own decision. herbal and over-the-counter non-drug therapies do not have to prove effacacy in the same way of prescription drugs. hi ask any company selling these and they will all say yes they have to they want you to buy them. but just google this natural testosterone boosters and see how you get on lots of help. so how old are you and are you having ed problems?"
hi i found this piece for you should help her to understand things and you. for those who have taken valproate during pregnancy and would like to breastfeed the news is good. only about % of valproate in the mothers blood passes through breast milk however even less actually enters the babys bloodstream. further how valproate affects the baby is unknown and most babies breastfed on valproate experience no side effects. it is strongly felt by neurologists and epileptologists that the benefits of breastfeeding largely outweigh the risks of exposing the baby to antiepileptic medications including valproate. as a matter of fact the american academy of neurology and the american epilepsy society both recommend breastfeeding in women with epilepsy. its from this site <link> do hope this helps you both. good luck
"the correct and less-vulgar term for the male genitalia is ""penis"" and the answer is a remote possibility of yes since there is viable sperm present in the tiny amount of semen that can leak during sexual excitation. if you were ovulating at the time there is a remote possibility of a pregnancy occurring. needless to say if you and this penis-owner do not plan on having a child at this time you will be wise to cautious with your sex-play."
no. bacterial vaginosis is not transmitted in the pool unless of course you are having sex in the pool. bacterial vaginosis may be transmitted by direct sexual contact.
hi massage session usually wont cause such eye problems. may be refractive error or lens problem. get opthalmoscopy and retinoscopy done. consult a opthalmologist. does not seem to be serious issue and you should definitely get a cure. thanks
"that question is really unanswerable. some women get pregnant on the first attempt; others can take several months. assuming you are ovulating assuming your partner is capable of fathering a child and assuming neither one of you have any medical issues that may make pregnancy more difficult and assuming you are eating well and healthy you will eventually get pregnant. the body is designed to conceive but there is absolutely no way to be sure that this ""first time"" attempt will succeed. if you do not get pregnant. try. try. again."
depending on the context the abbreviation ggt could mean a couple of different things. it could be used for an abbreviation of the latin word guttae which mean drops. when seen on an eye medication prescription like - ggt every four hours it means - drops every four hours. the pharmacist should put it in non-latin on your prescription bottle. the other possibility is the abbreviation for a blood test called gamma-glutamyltransferase one of the many diagnostic medical tests used to evaluate the condition of liver pancreas and biliary tract. this test is usually included in a basic liver function panel.
hi i think part exercise related and part warmth i have found the neoprene supports are really good for warmth and if need be try doubling up or them. but you really need to go back to basics from when you had this done for exercises get back into them daily but if this is not working ice it to get the swelling down  times a day for you its just get a shovel of snow in a carrier bag keep that on your knee for  minutes. hope this helps you. good luck

you will need to see your medical provider so you can be properly examined have your urine tested etc. this is not something that can be blindly solved over the internet without a thorough medical history some lab work and a good examination to search for the reasons.
hi i think a trip to your doctor is called for asap if not get to an er good luck
hi it seems more of als but the history does not confirm it. it needs further investigations like lumbar puncture with csf examination. other possibilities like hormonal imbalances severe vitamin d deficiency etc also should be kept in mind. thanks
most sex addicts live in denial of their addiction and treating an addiction is dependent on the person accepting and admitting that he or she has a problem. in many cases it takes a significant event -- such as the loss of a job the break-up of a marriage an arrest or health crisis -- to force the addict to admit to his or her problem. treatment of sexual addiction focuses on controlling the addictive behavior and helping the person develop a healthy sexuality. treatment includes education about healthy sexuality individual counseling and marital and/or family therapy. support groups and  step recovery programs for people with sexual addictions (like sex addicts anonymous) also are available. in some cases medications used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder may be used to curb the compulsive nature of the sex addiction. these drugs could include prozac and anafranil.
before making any recommendations i would really need some additional information about your daughter and the medications she is using. . it is unlikely that a medication for impetigo or an eye drop medicine would interfere with any over-the-counter fever reducers. so it is likely to be fine. i would suggest you ask your pharmacist to recommend a medication to reduce your daughter's fever based on her age weight and the other medications she's taking.
this is an over-dosage but not a toxic or dangerous over-dosage assuming if just was one isolated incident. one needs to be very careful and not exceed recommended dosages of prescription or non-prescription medications. the most likely side effect would be gastrointestinal.
not an expert here but i'm going to say no because it just means he probably swallowed some of the blood from his nosebleed and depending how much blood he swallowed it may have made him nauseated.
sure. you can even have sex when you are not ovulating. of course having unprotected sex during ovulation is how you get pregnant so if this is not your goal right now or if you are not on an effective method of birth control many women will avoid sex during the only time of the month that conception is highly likely.
yes. if you are truly having outbreaks of genital herpes you should be on daily anti-viral medications. your medical provider will need to call in a prescription.
sometimes you can burn more calories when you are asleep than when you are just lying in bed. and it all has to do with our stages of sleep specifically rem sleep. during rem sleep your brain is more active than any other stage. in fact in some cases it is more active than when you are awake. this activity requires fuel for thought called glucose – the basic building block of most foods. in order to sleep better and lose weight: lose the snooze and set your alarm to tell you when to go to bed. use your alarm to help you know when to go bed to get the right amount of quality sleep. dont use the snooze button to potentially interrupt those final minutes of rem sleep! take a quick nap if you are feeling drowsy in the middle of the day. drink one glass of water for every alcoholic beverage you drink and stop all alcohol  hours before your bed time alarm goes off. alcohol can help you fall asleep but will keep you out of the deep stages of sleep and rem sleep that you need to avoid sleep deprivation stop exercise four hours before bed. work out earlier in the evening and consider yoga deep breathing or stretching before bed. have your breakfast outside in the morning and get plenty of sunlight to help re-set your internal biological clock. sleep loss affects weight loss — from your ability to burn calories to the food choices you make. start with a commitment to sleeping better and you may find yourself a few pounds lighter without changing anything else.
hi it just gets absorbed into your own body and that's it egg no more. good luck
i would recommend evaluation by a dermatologist.
prostatitis should not cause redness/soreness at the tip of the penis so you are correct. there is likely another cause. unfortunately it would not be possible to determine a specific cause blindly over the internet based solely on your very brief description. you will need to see your medical provider again not just because of this redness/soreness but because you apparently have not responded to three weeks of antibiotics for your prostatitis. you may want to consider seeing a urologist.
hi ok i think i see what you mean no he's right you cant get a cold by being cold or working outside without extra clothing and the same for flu. there both virus's and can only be passed on from somebody else. working outside in fresh air is very good for you. do hope this helps you. good luck

hi look i cant see it but did you take the missed pill the next day on both times if you had done this then things will be ok but normally if you miss one pill its not to bad but doing it twice in one month if you did not back them up as above but then you have had your period you may just have come without egg on your face. but you really need to get your act together on bc pill taken same time same place each day so simple. good luck
not only that but while that is one reason paint and other chemicals can cause problems. its not suggested but in the end its up to you
it usually heals spontaneously after the sty ruptures.
the trouble with hiv is it shares symptoms with many many other illnesses. many of those symptoms can be found in yourself with enough hard thought. hiv is also something that's very common to be afraid of understandably. it would be nearly impossible for your girlfriend to have gotten hiv from an abortion. direct blood to blood or sexual activity would have had to happen at the office. her medical professionals were wearing gloves washing hands sterilizing equipment just so she wouldn't have to worry about getting a disease. your anxiety has picked hiv as your own personal 'boogeyman. ' knowing that you can begin to deal with it.
cold flu bronchitis and sinus infections can cause an asthma attack. these respiratory infections that trigger asthma can be viral or bacterial and are a common cause of asthma especially in children under age . this airway sensitivity that causes the airways to more easily narrow can last as long as two months after an upper respiratory infection. it's thought that anywhere from % to % of asthmatic adults have coexisting sinus disease. conversely % to % of those with allergic rhinitis (hay fever) or sinusitis have evidence of asthma.
the best way to clear mucous from your nose is to first liquefy (use saline nasal spray) and then gently blow your nose --- one side at a time by occluding the other nostril. you can do this repeatedly. perhaps the reason your ear is building pressure is because you are blowing too hard and air is going up your eustachian tubes to your middle ear space (the area behind your eardrum). unless you have a medical reason not to take a decongestant it may be okay to do this during the day only but it will increase the nasal drainage (night time decongestants can keep you awake and the post-nasal drainage will annoy you). if you want to dry up your nose an antihistamine can help. remember that colds only last a week so don't over-treat them. just wait it out. and. finally. it is okay to swallow post-nasal mucous. you can spit it out assuming you do that privately or in a tissue. hocking them out grosses out people.
i had poison oak on my face over a month ago. haven't been in contact with it pets or the items i wore and yet it is on my face again (not as serious as the first time but bad). first time i received a cortisone shot which helped over a two week period. this time my doctor put me on methylprednisoone and within  hours the itching has stopped. the swelling appears to be better and i hope my face goes back to normal soon. i believe that it has stayed in my body and returns when you are in a stressful situation. i did find the first time that if you made a paste of baking soda and water and put it on the affected area it does reduce the itching (supposedly draws the toxins out too).
infection will get worse. could do irrepairable damage to kidneys. go to doctor you need antibiotics.
kidneys are fine. this may be a low grade urinary tract infection. taking broad spectrum antibiotics and local creams will be helpful an associated vaginal infection should be considered. take anti fungal tablets
many older anti-epileptic drugs (dilantin tegretol phenobarb) have been identified to cause bone loss. more recently depakote has also been shown to potentially contribute to bone loss. problems with bone health frequently are a concern in an older age person with epilepsy but can ffect younger individuals as well. in this setting you and your doctor could discuss switching to a different anti-epileptic drug that may have less of a problem with bone health. alternatively if this is clearly the best medicine for your son's seizures he could be treated for his bone loss initially with vitamin d and calcium with other meds added if needed. this is not an urgent situation as bone loss occurs slowly over many years but it is something you need to pay attention to and discuss with your doctor.
sharp shooting pains on either side of your stomach may result from the stretching tissue supporting your growing uterus. these pains may also travel down your thigh and into your leg. recommendations: change your position or activity until you are comfortable; avoid sharp turns or movements. if you have a sudden pain in your abdomen bend forward to the point of pain to relieve tension and relax the tissue. apply a hot water bottle heating pad or take a warm bath or shower. try massage. make sure you are getting enough fluids. take tylenol (acetaminophen) occasionally. contact your health care provider if the pain is severe or constant or if you are less than  weeks pregnant and you have signs of labor.

how long have you had the mirena in before it fell out? i don't think your doing anything wrong. every woman's body adjusts different to any and all birth control. i would suggest to you keep having fun in the bed room but stop trying to get pregnant. the more you have sex without the hope of getting pregnant the suprise will come sooner than you think.
call your doctor or poison control center or go to the emergency room.
this area where its being painful do you have blisters? shingles comes with blisters and this you have said anything about? just answer through answer this above.
of course dehydration can aggrevate your problem. i recommend a patch test to determine the chemicals you are allergic to. also wear clothing that is made out of natural fabrics such as cotton and linen wear clothing that is light coloured as these will contain less dye wear loose fitting clothing in hot/humid environments avoid clothing that is labeled non-iron and dirt-repellent as it is likely these have been chemically treated avoid clothing marked wash separately as this implies dyes easily bleed from the fabric

"my advice is for you to see a gynecologist to determine why your menses is delayed. there are hormonal ways of correcting this problem. do not pass go; do not collect $; go directly to your gyn. i agree with the above advice however i would also recommend going to a doctor and checking for any internal damage from your falls. i did cheer also and understand the risks and accidents that happen with the ""sport"". make sure when you took your pregnancy tests that they were taken correctly by this i mean that you waited the proper amount of time. some times extreme weight loss or exercise can throw a wrench in the flow ya know? call your doctor to make sure. <positive_smiley>"

"many women choose to ""skip"" their period by skipping the placebo week of their birth control pill and starting the next pack beginning with the first day of active pills as usual. some people refer to this as ""combining pill packs. "" it is usually a safe practice though as with all medical decisions i would encourage you to speak with your healthcare provider about it before doing so (you can call and ask about it over the phone; if they feel they need to see you for an appointment they should let you know). ."
hi insect bite or allergic reaction seems to be a possibility. apply anti histamine steroid local cream. take anti allergic tablets if needed. thanks
ph is the acid/base balance in the urine. don't confuse it with psa a prostate-cancer screening test. a ph of  is the same as water so your husband has been drinking an adequate amount of fluids. this is good.
typically it's really not enough coverage because you don't get all your face covered with that mineral powder foundation. so i do recommend a moisturizer with spf underneath and then you can use the mineral powder on top.
hi. there have been changes in your body as a whole causing these problems. i suggest you to consult a good endocrinologist who can help you out with these issues. a dermatologist can tell u any recent advances to tackle these problems. thanks
go to your pharmacist to learn about the drugs you are taking not physicians. physicians only receive a few hours of pharmacology education. they get their education from the pharm reps who you see sitting in their offices waiting to see them. pretty scary but true.
call your surgeon or primary care doctor for patient-specific advice. you may need to have a blood count and certainly be examined.
hey well i have a tilted uterus as well. its not as difficult as you think to get pregnant. i did my homework and researched this when i wanted to get pregnant. if you are wanting to get pregnant it just means you need a little extra help. what my research told me was that certain positions are highly recommended for pregnancy. these positions are man on top with a pillow under your pelvis and also doggy style. these positions provide direct access to the uterus! good luck
the penis is covered by skin and skin can itch for hundreds of reasons. a common cause would include yeast (balanitis) or simple dry skin like you described. contact dermatitis (allergy) to soaps or laundry detergent is another possibility. a yeast infection would respond to an over-the-counter antifungal cream; dry skin or allergic rashes will respond favorably to hydrocortisone cream (followed by a moisturizer). some people mix them together and use both so this may be something to try. if it doesn't work see your medical provider or a dermatologist for a consultation and exam.
though gastro intestinal and gynecological issues are both responsible but the menstrual bleeding seems to be causing majority of the symptoms. consult a gynecologist. maintain hydration drink plenty of fruit juices

did you take pregnancy test if not then please first of all go for it. if you took and it is negative then you are having amenorrhea in which a woman experience absence of periods for three to six months or longer. it happens due to imblance of body hormones estrogen and progeterone. due to this hormonal imbalance a woman usually got disturb her normal pattern of periods. and another reason for it in women can be pcos and hypothyroidism. so if you want to regulate your monthly cycle you need to go for ht (hormonal therapy) in which a woman need to go on birth control pills to balance the body hormones. these pills or contraceptive pills contains body hormones estrogen and progestrone and help to control irregular periods. and for this you can opt for depo provera ovral g nexplanon and mirena etc. and you may get these medicines at your doorstep from online pharmacies like  etc.
in my opinion increased wbc in your case can be from the drug treatment it self however it does not explain the body shivering follow a healthy diet for  week ( honey garlic lemon ) if you do not improve then i suggest looking for other possibilities like anemia bacterial infection or leukemia good luck
an spf  blocks about % that means % of the sun's rays are still getting through to your skin. and that if you are using enough product which nobody ever does. so chances are if you are using an spf  the way that most people use it you are probably only getting an spf  out of it. so the higher spf the better. using plenty of product applying it liberally or generously will really help you as well and going to the lower end products you are really just not getting enough protection.
its normal in some kids. usually goes away with age. but if it happens frequently and if the color is more dark then paediatric opinion is recommended. low oxygen content in blood is the most common cause.
if you are sensitized to the rh factor if your blood is rh-negative and you have been sensitized to rh-positive blood you now have antibodies to rh-positive blood. the antibodies kill rh-positive red blood cells. if you become pregnant with an rh-positive baby ( fetus ) the antibodies can destroy your fetus's red blood cells. this can cause anemia. if you are already rh-sensitized and are pregnant your treatment will focus on preventing or minimizing fetal harm and on avoiding early (preterm) delivery. treatment options depend on how well or poorly the fetus is doing. if testing shows that your fetus is rh-positive but is only mildly affected by your rh factor antibodies you will be closely monitored until your pregnancy reaches term. your fetus will be delivered early only if his or her condition worsens. if testing shows that your fetus is moderately affected by your rh antibodies your fetus's condition will be closely monitored until his or her lungs are mature enough for a preterm delivery. a cesarean section may be used to deliver the baby quickly or to avoid the difficulty of inducing labor before term. a moderately affected newborn sometimes requires a blood transfusion immediately after birth. if testing shows that your fetus is severely affected by your rh factor antibodies a blood transfusion may be given before birth ( intrauterine fetal blood transfusion ). this can be done through the fetus's abdomen or directly into the fetus's umbilical cord. a preterm delivery is likely to be needed. multiple blood transfusions are sometimes needed to keep a fetus healthy until the fetal lungs mature enough to function after birth. often a cesarean section is done to deliver the baby quickly. a blood transfusion is sometimes needed immediately after birth. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

sadly yes. you can pass herpes type  or  to your children so it would be wise to hold off on kissing them when you have a lip lesion breakout. when you have genital lesions you should consider taking some suppression medicine (antiviral drugs) to limit your outbreaks and exercise some caution when touching these lesions or sharing towels. herpes can be spread even when you do not have active lesions but this is less common. there is a good chance that your children may get exposed to herpes simplex from one of their classmates at some time in their young lives so if they do get it it may not be from you exclusively.

"no this is not ok. yes you should see a doctor or psychotherapist or psychiatrist. depression is very common and there are many very good medications available these days to treat it. the same is true of anxiety which might be what you're experiencing and which could cause the shortness of breath nausea and stomachache you describe. you are not alone in your feelings. many people experience the same things which i hope brings you comfort. a doctor can help you figure out what's going on and suggest treatment for you. you deserve to live a happy full fulfilled life. you're worth it. personally i do not believe in taking antidepressants without ""talk therapy"" (also called cognitive therapy). i think you might benefit from a combination of both and i encourage you to seek this help. i wish you all the best!"
when you're bitten by a malaria -infected mosquito the parasites that cause malaria are injected into your blood and invade your liver cells. the parasite reproduces in the liver cells which then burst open allowing thousands of new parasites to enter the bloodstream and infect red blood cells. the parasites reproduce again in the blood cells kill the blood cells and then move to other uninfected blood cells. the time from the initial malaria infection until symptoms appear (incubation period) generally ranges from:   to  days for plasmodium (p. ) falciparum.  to  days for p. vivax and p. ovale.  to  days for p. malariae.  to  days for p. knowlesi. symptoms can appear in  days. occasionally the time between exposure and signs of illness may be as long as  to  months with p. vivax and p. ovale because these parasites can survive in the human liver for a long time. the incubation period may be longer if you are taking medicine to prevent infection (chemoprophylaxis) or have developed partial immunity due to previous infections. malaria can begin with flu -like symptoms. in the early stages infection from p. falciparum is similar to infection from p. vivax p. malariae and p. ovale. you may have no symptoms or symptoms that are less severe if you are immune or partially immune to malaria. common malaria symptoms include: fever. chills and a rapidly rising temperature. headaches nausea and extreme sweating. symptoms may appear in cycles. the time between episodes of fever and other symptoms varies with the specific parasite you are infected with. episodes of symptoms may occur: every  hours if you are infected with p. vivax or p. ovale. every  hours if you are infected with p. malariae. p. falciparum does not usually have a regular cyclic fever. after the early stages life-threatening complications develop rapidly with p. falciparum and p. knowlesi and if untreated may result in irreversible complications or death.  if untreated you may recover in a week to a month (or longer) after being infected with p. vivax p. malariae or p. ovale. malaria can be a very serious disease for a pregnant woman and her unborn baby ( fetus ) and for young children. medication choices are limited for a pregnant woman or a child. infection with p. falciparum can lead to death for a pregnant woman and her fetus. for these reasons a pregnant woman should not travel to an area where she could get p. falciparum malaria. visit the cdc web site (www. cdc. gov/malaria/travel/index. htm) to find out whether malaria is a problem in the country where you will be traveling. malaria recurrences malaria caused by p. falciparum may come back (recur) at irregular intervals for up to  years if treatment is not complete. malaria caused by p. vivax and p. ovale may recur at irregular intervals for up to  to  years but medication treatment can prevent relapses. p. malariae can remain in the blood of an infected person for more than  years usually without causing any symptoms. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.
in my opinion you should check your uric acid levels in both urine and blood probiotic have nothing to do with your problems also no virus can explain this
before blindly starting in home remedies it would be good to have your elderly mother properly examined. finding a reason for his bloody ear discharge. this could easily be an infection that requires a prescription antibiotic or just a scratch in the ear canal. without an exam it would be difficult to know how to effectively treat it. the oozing from the navel is likely a skin infection perhaps impetigo (a staph or strep infections). again because of her age this may need more aggressive treatment than what you can provide at home. you can carefully clean this area with betadine and use a topical antibiotic ointment for now. it may or may not help. sometimes an elderly person will get fungal infections in both these areas so an antibiotic would not help. if this is the case anti-fungal treatments are required. again getting a proper diagnosis first would be best.
ok its possible to get a missed period with out worrying it happens. the yeast infection and the antibiotics your have been on there could be a link to the missed period this would depend on your medical history. next time your on antibiotics try taken yogurt each day your on the should stop the yeast infections if you do get a yeast infection try warm sea salt baths and just let the water get inside your vagina for more info just google sea salt and yeast infection. hope this helps you. good luck
hopefully you have seen a doctor about this strain if it seems serious it may be a torn muscle and may cause other problems. mistreating an abdominal strain (either by icing or stretching wrong) could be fatal. speak to a doctor before treating a sprain. if it is mild or you have already spoken to a doctor : rest: rest is recommended for the early recovery phase lasting  to  days depending on the severity of the injury. immobilization is not usually necessary and can be potentially harmful. immobilization in a splint or cast should be carefully supervised by your doctor as this can lead to stiffness of the muscle. ice: ice application helps reduce swelling bleeding and pain. ice application should begin as soon as possible after sustaining a muscle pull. ice applications can be done frequently but should not be done for more than  minutes at a time. anti-inflammatory medications: anti-inflammatory medications can help reduce swelling and alleviate painful symptoms. these medications do have potential side effects and you should check with your doctor prior to starting anti-inflammatory medications. gentle stretching: stretching and strengthening are useful in treatment and prevention of muscle strain injuries. muscles that are stronger and more flexible are less likely to be injured. strengthening: after injuring the muscle it is important to regain strength before returning to athletic activities. both the injury itself and the rest period following the injury can reduce the strength of the muscle. stronger muscles are less likely to sustain a re-injury. heat applications: laboratory studies have shown that temperature can influence the stiffness of a muscle. by keeping the body and muscles warm the muscle is less likely to sustain a strain type of injury. avoid muscle fatigue: muscles help absorb energy and restoring the strength of the muscle will help prevent re-injury. muscles that are fatigued are more likely to be injured. athletes should use caution especially as they become fatigued as the muscle becomes more susceptible to strain injuries. warm-up properly: warming up prior to athletic competition or sports will help loosen the muscle and prevent injuries. jumping into a sport with stiff muscles can lead to a higher chance of straining the muscle.
hi no male sperm is not that magical and you would really notice if there was that amount of sperm on the door knob to get pregnant. sperms good but not that good. so relax and take a long deep breath. good luck
if this is an innocent skin cyst on the shaft of your penis and properly diagnosed by a medical professional (and not self-diagnosed) a cyst would not preclude you from sexual activity as long as its presence did not worry your partner. these tiny cysts (often sebaceous cysts) can be easily removed so if they are concerning you just get the cyst taken off. as long as you are sure it is a cyst and not an std. then it should be no problem. hopefully it won't freak your partner out though. you could try using one of those penis health cremes ( man oil is a good one) to improve upon overall skin texture and hygiene down there. this might counterbalance the issue with the cyst. hope this helps!
not true but breast-feeding is definiely helpful after a delivery not only for the baby (of course) and it does help your uterus. your uterus will be just fine rather you choose to breastfed or not. to be truthful no uterus regains it's pre-pregnancy size again.
less likely to be hsv. seems more of diaper rash. application of anti histaminic ointments can help. see a skin specialist if it does not respond.
your daughter is obese and needs a full assessment. her major weight gain occurred roughly at the time her endocrine system kicked in with her menstrual cycle. i would ask her physician to look into two conditions: cushing's disease and polycystic ovarian syndrome. the evaluations are straightforward and both are amenable to effective therapies. clearly her thyroid function needs to be assessed as well. if the family history is strong for obesity it is common for girls to express the obesity gene at time of pubescence. teens can sneak eat with the best of them so what you see her eat may not at all reflect what she's actually consuming. if the home environment includes lots of junk food sitting around and people who are themselves not practicing healthy nutrition and exercise habits then she'll emulate those habits. finally research shows that in teen girls physical activity plummets by the age of  or so. they literally stop moving. but they don't stop eating. thus the problem. please get the medical assessment done completely and as soon as possible.
it may be best to take them all at once. in the mornings (they can keep you awake).

hi i hope these are not painful. most probably these are ganglion cysts and usually these go away by simple compressive massage maneauvers. get a ultrasound scan done if the size increases. intra-lesional aspiration with steroid injection into the cyst will help. surgery has high chances of recurrence and should be avoided. thanks
hi have you been having unprotected sex? even just putting you penis and not ejaculating she can still get pregnant if you masturbated before sex then sperm would be in your urethra and any sperm would be carried in pre-cum. so all you can do is get her to her doctors and get a test done there best way. good luck
"believe it or not you can actually take too many vitamins and they can build up in your body and possibly cause toxicity. this can happen with the ""fat soluble"" vitamins which are a d e and k. you definitely want to be careful and make sure that your health-care provider (they may run blood work periodically) and pharmacist know everything that you are taking."
was he having any recent infection common cold flu? if yes when and what was the symptoms?

hi there: my two year old also had that. she ended up having to have an inhaler because her airways would inflate when she was active therefore causing her to have trouble breathing. after she used the inhaler for a while it went away and now she is a healthy almost  year old! we only ever used it the one time. i would reccomend it. good luck.
fibromyalgia can cause symptoms similar to arthritis bursitis and tendinitis. consequently some experts group fibromyalgia with arthritis and related disorders. the pain associated with these other conditions is typically localized to a single area while the pain and stiffness of fibromyalgia are very widespread and consists of deep muscle pain morning stiffness and painful tender points making it difficult to exercise or be physically active.
hello -- in the depression community <link> (first and tenth posts) we have a list of resources for finding free/low-cost medical care including counseling. take a look there for some other ideas. i'm so sorry you are suffering such heartache. -- susie margaret
here are some basic steps that you can take to protect yourself from contracting stds: consider that not having sex is the only sure way to prevent stds. use a latex condom every time you have sex particularly if you have more than one sex partner. (if you use a lubricant make sure it is water-based. ) limit your number of sexual partners. the more partners you have the more likely you are to catch a std. practice monogamy. this means having sex with only one person. that person must also have sex with only you to reduce your risk. choose your sex partners with care. don't have sex with someone whom you suspect may have a std or who has many sexual partners. get checked for stds. don't risk giving the infection to someone else or your baby. just because you've been screened for stds early on in your pregnancy does not mean that you can't contract one later during your pregnancy. if you engage in unprotected sex with more than one partner since your last std screen you need another set of screening tests. also you should be concerned if your partner may be having unprotected sex with other people. don't use alcohol or drugs before you have sex. you may be less likely to practice safe sex if you are drunk or high. plus alcohol and drugs can harm your developing baby. know the signs and symptoms of stds. look for them in yourself and your sex partners. learn about stds. the more you know about stds the better you can protect yourself.
that is the nature of this herpetic beast. it does come back often in the exact same spot or in close proximity. this characteristic often helps clinicians make the diagnosis.
"there are many different types of condoms including non-latex ones. i think your boyfriend should use them so find a brand that is compatible. why? condoms prevent stds not just pregnancy. if your boyfriend strays just one time you will be at risk and the same goes for you. you have a fight and break up; both of you may be vulnerable to a one-night stand. if or when you get back to together either one of you could bring back an ""unwanted gift"" of an std. yes you are probably well-covered for pregnancy assuming you take your pills correctly but having that extra margin of safety would seem to be worth it."
you are suffering from anxiety. as a result you are over focusing on one particular condition which are allergies. the more you think of it the more anxiety you develop. if you need to address your allergies consult an allergist. just get your mind off of it. allergies are a very common problem. and not life threatening.
do not use foradil unless your healthcare provider has taught you and you understand everything. ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist if you have any questions. children should use foradil certihaler with an adult's help as instructed by the child's healthcare provider. use foradil certihaler exactly as prescribed. do not use foradil certihaler more often than prescribed. the usual dose is one inhalation through the certihaler inhaler twice a day (morning and evening). the two doses should be about  hours apart. if you miss a dose of foradil certihaler just skip that dose. take your next dose at your usual time. never take two doses at one time. do not use a spacer device with foradil certihaler. do not breathe into foradil certihaler. while you are using foradil certihaler twice a day do not use other medicines that contain a long-acting beta  -agonist (laba) for any reason. other laba medicines include foradil aerolizer (formoterol fumarate inhalation powder) serevent diskus (salmeterol xinofoate inhalation powder) or advair diskus (fluticasone propionate and salmeterol inhalation powder) brovana (arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution) or symbicort (budesonide and formoterol fumarate dehyrdate solution aerosol). do not change or stop any of your medicines to control or treat your breathing problems. your healthcare provider will adjust your medicines as needed. make sure you always have a short-acting beta  -agonist medicine with you. use your short-acting beta  -agonist medicine if you have breathing problems between doses of foradil certihaler. call your healthcare provider or get medical care right away if: your breathing problems worsen with foradil certihaler. you need to use your short-acting beta  -agonist medicine more often than usual. your short-acting beta  -agonist medicine does not work as well for you at relieving symptoms. you need to use four or more inhalations of your short-acting beta  -agonist medicine for two or more days in a row. you use one whole canister of your short-acting beta  -agonist medicine in eight weeks. your peak flow meter results decrease. your healthcare provider will tell you the numbers that are right for you. you have asthma and your symptoms do not improve after using foradil certihaler regularly for one week.
it may be a pilonidal sinus tract but this is just a guess since i do not know anything about you your medical history etc.
this might be a form of a genetic condition called keratosis pilaris. it can also occur on the upper outer arms. some people grow into it over time; others are lucky and grow out of it over time. you can control it but not cure it. products containing lactic acid salicylic acid and glycolic acid alone or in combination can be very helpful.
whether or not health plans available under the affordable care act will cover second opinions will vary according to the individual insurance plan. there is no mandate under the law requiring insurers to cover second opinions. so if that is important to you be sure to check with the individual carrier before you sign up for a plan. and because insurers may distinguish between the kinds of second opinions they cover (e. g. may cover a consultation with another doctor but not necessarily a round of new expensive diagnostic tests) be sure to be specific.
they usually prescribe compression stockings for such a condition.
most helpful answer i have never heard that cholesterol causes stomach pains. just because a cause was not readily apparent does not mean one should blame this type of pain on cholesterol. the fact that he is still in pain (after eating) and going through pepto bismol is proof that he needs to have a higher level evaluation. seeing a pediatric gastroenterologist would be the way to go if his pediatrician or primary care provider is not willing to order further diagnostic tests. there are so many things that could be causing this discomfort for gastritis (inflammation of the stomach) reflux gallbladder disease (especially if your son is overweight) hiatal hernia etc. appendicitis would likely cause pain in his right lower quadrant (down near the right iliac/hip area) and would not really present symptoms like you are describing. if he is under stress at home or school this could be making things worse. get a referral to a gastroenterologist so that he can be properly diagnosed and treated. stomach pains in an  year old could be many things- gastritis (when the stomach lining is irritated) reflux (like heartburn in adults) constipation or something more serious. sometimes anxiety or stress can make kids have abdominal pain. in any case you should be seen by your doctor or a specialist. if its been going on for a while your son needs to be evaluated. i have not heard of cholesterol issues causing stomach pains. talk to your doctor or subspecialist as soon as you can.
in case you didn't know it ringworm isn't caused by a worm at all. ringworm is actually a skin fungus just like athlete's foot or jock itch. you can get ringworm in a variety of ways from sharing a towel with someone who's infected to touching damp surfaces that carry the fungus. the fungus that causes ringworm thrives in warm damp environments which is why it's frequently acquired in places like public pool common areas. to your question: you could catch ringworm from your friend even if you didn't touch the lesion. the reason is because the fungus could be infecting other areas of your friend's skin but not showing the characteristic ring mark yet. if you have thoroughly washed and dried the skin areas that came in contact with your friend you're probably not going to get ringworm. however be careful not to share any sports gear or towels with your friend and be sure to wear flip-flops or other foot protection if you all are bathing in a common shower area or something like that. by the way ringworm will not clear up on its own. it needs to be treated with an anti-fungal preparation. your friend can try using an over-the-counter cream for athlete's foot (the generic name is miconazole) but if that doesn't help or if the ringworm starts spreading your friend should seek medical attention. in rare instances ringworm is best treated with a prescription medication. hope this helps! my daughter caught it from her friend  yrs ago and it was from putting her slippers on. i never caught it tho when i rubbed the ointment on her back where it was. i immediately washed my hands tho too. i guess different people affected differently by things.
a fe puffs of what? i have no idea what your drug test will be checking or the sensitivity of the test but if you had a few puffs of marijuana it may definitely show up. not a wise decision to do before a drug test.
coughing is not a side-effect of this antibiotic so it is more likely the cough is being caused by something else. cleocin doesn't taste very good so gagging may be a problem in a two-year old but not coughing. i don't advise you to stop the antibiotic unless specifically advised to do so by the dentist (you can always call them) or his pediatrician -- professionals that know his case.
"the rule of thumb is that  when you do not have a fever for more than  hours and did not take any medications to help reduce the fever. when you don't have a fever your not contagious according to the u. s. cdc: ""most healthy adults may be able to infect others beginning  day before symptoms develop and up to  to  days after becoming sick. children may pass the virus for longer than  days. symptoms start  to  days after the virus enters the body. that means that you may be able to pass on the flu to someone else before you know you are sick as well as while you are sick. some persons can be infected with the flu virus but have no symptoms. during this time those persons may still spread the virus to others. "" according to the center for disease control you are contagious for - days before you ever become sick with the flu so if you are not running fever but are still contagious before the fever comes then how can you still not be contagious for at least  days after you stop having fever? evidently the flu doesnt need fever to be contagious in the beginning. after fever subsides"
only one sperm is needed to get you pregnant but if you are on the pill and consistently take it. and use condoms every time you are about as safe as you can be without being completely abstinent. if you are engaging in sexual play where your vagina is being exposed to any semen (even before ejaculation) you have a very small risk of pregnancy but remember that your birth control pills are very protective. not % but close.
this drink will not have any effect on your cholesterol. enjoy.
"i'm sorry you're going through this. it sounds uncomfortable and unsettling. keep pursuing this situation with your physician. sometimes swelling of the lower limbs is caused by simple things like too much salt consumption or having a job that requires you to be on your feet all day (like a nurse for example. ) but other times swollen legs and feet can be a symptom of something more serious like congestive heart failure. because you state you feel fatigued you are considered ""symptomatic. "" in other words you're not just experiencing swollen feet with no other complaints (""asymptomatic""). and any time a patient has at least one sign (swelling) plus symptoms fatigue) it deserves to be investigated. if possible go back to your doctor as soon as you can. if nothing else call your doctor's nurse and explain how you're feeling. they will give you guidance on what to do. wishing you well!"
there is no reason to wait to introduce a multivitamin as symptoms of celiac disease usually improve in a few days to weeks and this means absorption of nutrients increases as well. it will take longer for the intestines to completely heal and studies shows this varies from individual to individual (can take - years in adults and some may not experience full regeneration of the intestinal villi). it's also beneficial to get lab work done to see if there any specific nutrient deficiencies such as iron folic acid and vitamin d. in some cases additional supplementation will be needed. always consult your doctor. for more on diet and supplements for celiac disease see this webmd article.
yes and what a great question. both seasonal and   flu shots or nasal spray should be given to breastfeeding mothers. breastfeeding is fully compatible with flu vaccination and preventing the flu in mothers can reduce the chance that the infant will get the flu. also by breastfeeding mothers can pass on to the infant the antibodies that their bodies make in response to the flu shots which can reduce the infants chances of getting sick with the flu. this is especially important for infants less than  months old who have no other way of receiving vaccine antibodies since they are too young to be vaccinated.
"keep talking with your parents. they are the key to you being properly evaluated either by taking you to a counselor or to your regular medical provider. i don't know your age but many schools have ""school psychologists"" that can help you. if you feel that you have a problem that needs to be addressed then it should be addressed. simple as that. show your parents this posting."

how athlete's foot (tinea pedis) develops and how well it responds to treatment depends on the type of athlete's foot you have. toe web infection (interdigital) toe web infections (interdigital) often begin with skin that seems moist and pale white. you may notice itching burning and a slight odor. as the infection gets worse the skin between the toes becomes scaly peels and cracks. if the fungal infection becomes severe a bacterial infection also may develop. this can cause further skin breakdown. the bacterial infection may also infect the lower leg ( cellulitis of the lower leg). toe web infections often result in a sudden vesicular (blister) infection. toe web infections respond well to treatment. moccasin-type infection moccasin-type infections may begin with minor irritation dryness itching burning or scaly skin and progress to thickened cracked skin on the sole or heel. in severe cases the toenails become infected and can thicken crumble and even fall out. if you do not take preventive measures this infection often returns. you may also develop an infection on the palm of the hand (symptoms commonly affect one hand and both feet). moccasin-type infections may be long-lasting (chronic) and are very difficult to treat. vesicular infection vesicular infections ( blisters ) usually begin with a sudden outbreak of blisters that become red and inflamed. blisters occasionally erupt again after the initial infection. a bacterial infection may also be present. a vesicular infection often develops from a long-lasting toe web infection. blisters may also appear on palms the side of the fingers and other areas (dermatophytid or id reaction). vesicular infections usually respond well to treatment. complications if untreated skin blisters and cracks caused by athlete's foot can lead to severe bacterial infections. in some types of athlete's foot the toenails may be infected. for more information see the topic fungal nail infections. all types of athlete's foot can be treated but symptoms often return after treatment. athlete's foot is most likely to return if: you don't take preventive measures and are again exposed to fungi that cause athlete's foot. you don't use antifungal medicine for the prescribed length of time and the fungi are not completely killed. the fungi are not completely killed even after the full course of medicine. severe infections that appear suddenly and keep returning can lead to long-lasting infection. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

that would be up to the endocrinologist but most people by the age of  have reached their adult height. hgh will not help if your growth plates have closed (you need an x-ray to make that determination). this issue is best handled by a specialist -- an endocrinologist.
in general you dont need to eat before exercise unless you tend to run low on energy during your workouts or its been more than a couple hours since your last full meal. the best time to eat is about  minutes before you begin to exercise and the best snack is one that combines carbohydrates and protein (with an emphasis on the carbs). and you dont need a lot of food. protein isnt a fuel for exercise so you dont want to overdo it. for carbs aim for the equivalent of a half bagel or a large banana; for protein consider a couple tablespoons of peanut butter or a small cup of yogurt. to get both if fresh food isnt an option look for energy bars with  to  grams of carbohydrates and about  grams of protein. steer clear of caffeine and warm fluids which tend to speed food through your intestine as well as dairy and high-fat or high-fiber foods all of which can upset your stomach slow down the absorption of carbs and leave you feeling sluggish. you should also stay well hydrated and avoid super high-calorie snacks because you might end up consuming more calories than you burn off.
"there may be a number of reasons why a woman gets depressed. hormone changes or a stressful life event such as a death in the family can cause chemical changes in the brain that lead to depression. depression is also an illness that runs in some families. other times it's not clear what causes depression. during pregnancy during pregnancy these factors may increase a woman's chance of depression: history of depression or substance abuse family history of mental illness little support from family and friends anxiety about the fetus problems with previous pregnancy or birth marital or financial problems young age (of mother) after pregnancy depression after pregnancy is called postpartum depression or peripartum depression. after pregnancy hormonal changes in a woman's body may trigger symptoms of depression. during pregnancy the amount of two female hormones estrogen and progesterone in a woman's body increases greatly. in the first  hours after childbirth the amount of these hormones rapidly drops back down to their normal non-pregnant levels. researchers think the fast change in hormone levels may lead to depression just as smaller changes in hormones can affect a woman's moods before she gets her menstrual period. occasionally levels of thyroid hormones may also drop after giving birth. the thyroid is a small gland in the neck that helps to regulate your metabolism (how your body uses and stores energy from food). low thyroid levels can cause symptoms of depression including depressed mood decreased interest in things irritability fatigue difficulty concentrating sleep problems and weight gain. a simple blood test can tell if this condition is causing a woman's depression. if so thyroid medicine can be prescribed by a doctor. other factors that may contribute to postpartum depression include: feeling tired after delivery broken sleep patterns and not enough rest often keeps a new mother from regaining her full strength for weeks. feeling overwhelmed with a new or another baby to take care of and doubting your ability to be a good mother. feeling stress from changes in work and home routines. sometimes women think they have to be ""super mom"" or perfect which is not realistic and can add stress. having feelings of loss -- loss of identity of who you are or were before having the baby loss of control loss of your pre-pregnancy figure and feeling less attractive. having less free time and less control over time. having to stay home indoors for longer periods of time and having less time to spend with your partner and loved ones."

what you are describing sounds like a seborrheic keratosis which is a benign condition; however this needs to be evaluated by your dermatologist who will be able to either treat the symptoms and reassure you or do a biopsy to send the lesion to the lab for further evaluation and treat it as needed.
this can be a form of ichthyosis which is genetic. your dermatologist can prescribe topical prescription-strength moisturizers to help control the condition and make his skin smoother less dry and more comfortable.
no.
removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) should eliminate all gallstone-related symptoms except in three situations: gallstones were left in the ducts there were problems with the bile ducts in addition to gallstones and the gallstones were and are not the cause of the symptoms. the possibility of gallstones in the ducts can be pursued with mrcp endoscopic ultrasound and ercp. there is only one problem with the ducts that can cause gallstone-like symptoms and that is a rare condition called sphincter of oddi dysfunction discussed below. the common bile duct has a muscular wall. the last several centimeters of the common bile duct's muscle immediately before the duct joins the duodenum comprise the sphincter of oddi. the sphincter of oddi controls the flow of bile. since the pancreatic duct usually joins the common bile duct shortly before it enters the duodenum the sphincter also controls the flow of fluid from the pancreatic duct. when the muscle of the sphincter tightens it shuts off the flow of bile and pancreatic fluid. when it relaxes bile and pancreatic fluid flow into the duodenum for example after a meal. the sphincter may become scarred and the duct is narrowed by the scarring. (the cause of the scarring is unknown). the sphincter also may go into spasm intermittently. in either case the flow of bile and pancreatic fluid may intermittently stop abruptly mimicking the effects of a gallstone particularly causing biliary colic and pancreatitis. the diagnosis of sphincter of oddi dysfunction can be difficult to make. the best diagnostic test requires an endoscopic procedure with the same type of endoscope as ercp. instead of filling the ducts with dye however the pressure within the sphincter is measured. if the pressure is abnormally high scarring or spasm of the sphincter are likely. the treatment for sphincter of oddi dysfunction is sphincterotomy. measurement of liver and pancreatic enzymes in the blood also may be useful for diagnosing sphincter dysfunction.
that would depend on the cause of the vertigo. i have to tell you that there are hundreds of different causes. some will self-resolve over time and some will require medications to control the symptoms. if your vertigo has been persistent you will need to see your primary care medical provider or an ent for a thorough examination to look for a possible cause.
it looks like bone exostosis and not anything fatal. do not need surgical correction to prevent other complications as the area has certain delicate structures as well as there will be scarring that will further be unaesthetic. if still there is some other associated symptoms consult a general surgeon and get evaluated. hope this helps. regards.
it could be your gallbladder. if you still have your gallbladder speak to your physician about your symptoms. he should be able set you up with a hida scan to see if that is what is causing your discomfort.
we need to know the cause because treating the caise most probably will help was it a viral infection trauma or whaty need to do emgmost pf the cases resolves but it takes sometime.
well no that's certainly not a normal reaction to receiving a flu shot. however it's possible the two events are unrelated. regardless if the numbness and twitching don't clear up on their own after a few days this is worth getting checked out by a medical professional. a number of conditions can cause the symptoms you describe. a health care provider can diagnose the problem and get you appropriate treatment. you might consider putting in a call to your primary health care provider for an appointment now because you can always cancel it later if the symptoms go away. unless you're exhibiting signs of a stroke (which would not include muscle twitches) this probably isn't an emergency situation. hope this helps! i had this as well. i had the shot in my left shoulder yesterday and then the left side of my face went numb  hours later.  hours later it still doesn't feel quite right. doc's are stumped and want me to watch it. think it may be a sensation reaction. i get tingly on the left side of my tongue and random parts of my body occasionally. no twitching or drooping of face muscles. no more flu shots for this girl!
i'm sorry you're going through this. many conditions can cause skin lesions like the ones you describe and most of them are benign (non-cancerous). presumably that's what your gp thought or he probably wouldn't have suggested freezing them. since you're concerned i suggest you consult a dermatologist who has more training in skin lesions. he or she can tell you exactly what these lesions are and what treatment (if any) is appropriate. take care and good luck!
hii. there are few possibilities. it can be a enlarged lymph node a tooth infection causing cyst formation in that region. inflammed soft tissues in the region. give anti inflammatory medicines and if needed antibiotics. if this doesnt help consult a doctor thanks

"with what you have shared it is not likely that you are pregnant if that is your underlying concern. since you did not articulate a specific question i am assuming you are concerned about that ""wind"" feeling in your tummy. unfortunantely i do not have enough medical historical information or the ability to examine you in order to specifically address this issue but it may be unrelated to your pregnancy worries. i would suggest that you see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined and diagnosed. i was interesting that you wrote that ""he did not wear protection""? what about your protection? next time no condom; no sex play. period."
unless the particular antibiotic has to be taken at time when your stomach is empty you can take it anytime that you will consistently remember it.

prostate cancer is diagnosed from the results of a biopsy of the prostate gland. if the digital rectal exam of the prostate or the psa blood test is abnormal a prostate cancer is suspected. a biopsy of the prostate is usually then recommended. the biopsy is done from the rectum (trans-rectally) and is guided by ultrasound images of the area. a small piece of prostate tissue is withdrawn through a cutting needle. the trus-guided tru-cut biopsy is currently the standard method to diagnose prostate cancer. although initially a -core set was the standard currently most experts advocate sampling a minimum of  to  pieces of the prostate to improve the chances of detection of the cancer and also to provide a better idea regarding the extent and areas of involvement within the prostate. multiple pieces are taken by sampling the base apex and mid gland on each side of the gland. more cores may be sampled to increase the yield especially in larger glands. a pathologist a specialist physician who analyzes tissue samples under a microscope then examines the pieces under the microscope to assess the type of cancer present in the prostate and the extent of involvement of the prostate with the tumor. one also can get an idea about the areas of the prostate that are involved by the tumor by assessing which of the pieces contain the cancer and which of them do not. another very important assessment that the pathologist makes form the specimen is the grade (gleason's score) of the tumor. this indicates how different the cancer cells are from normal prostate tissue. grade gives an indication of how fast a cancer is likely to grow and has very important implications on the treatment plan and the chances of cure after treatment. a gleason score of six is supposed to indicate low-grade (less aggressive) disease while that of eight to  demonstrates high grade (more aggressive) cancer; seven is regarded as somewhere in between these two.
sorry you're experiencing this. unfortunately it's impossible to diagnose your condition without a physical exam. i suggest you consult a dermatologist. it's true this could be something simple along the lines of cradle cap which is a buildup of skin oils and cells. it also could be dandruff or scalp psoriasis. neither of those is life-threatening but it would be useful to get a true diagnosis because these conditions require different treatment. skin cancers are uncommon in your age group but it still wouldn't hurt to have a dermatologist take a look at your scalp just to be safe. hope this helps!
hi go with the scrape this would give a spring clean to her womb a nice way to make sure she's ok my wife had this says its really good for her. good luck
herpes does not cause or contribute to bacterial vaginosis. vaginal odor could be bv. or trichomonas. or even an impacted tampon so it would be best to see your medical provider so you can be properly examined and diagnosed. bv can be cured with the right medical regime. i am not sure what your doctors are using but this is not a difficult problem to treat. you can keep getting it back however if it is coming from the same (sexual) source.
yes it can especially if the urinary tract infection results in systemic symptoms (like fever) or involves the kidneys.
no thrush is caused by a yeast. buttermilk will not contribute to thrush at all.
"as soon as your surgeon give you the ""okay"". open surgeries require longer healing times than a laparoscopic procedure so your surgeon has the final say-so. i suspect it will not be more than a few weeks."
here are a few suggestions. i suggest anti-inflammatory tablet like voveran  mg (diclofenac) twice a day after meals. consult your doctor discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. for swelling use a compression bandage and ice the area for  minutes at a time. avoid squatting lunges and stairs till the pain subsides. also you need a good manual therapist to assess you for hamstring tightness quad weakness including vmo (vastus medialis oblique - thigh muscle) and gluteal weakness. try the above out for at least  days followed by three to four weeks of physiotherapy to get complete relief. for further information consult an orthopaedician and traumatologist online --> <link>
hi yes plaque can be a problem to clear it you need some cayenne pepper i take this each day i do it this way. but for you do this you mix cayenne with tomato paste and add olive oil to thin you mix this to a heat that suits you take  small spoonful's each morning and wash each one down with cold water with you can add very fine chopped garlic (do a whole head) mixed with dry parsley in olive oil all very good for your blood. you can also have green tea with honey lemon and ginger all very good for your blood and will add erections. if you can afford one try a cock ring i have a hardwear ice from myhardwear com should give you some great boners. but please remember ed jokes us just as things are getting good back it comes. do hope this helps you. good luck
for the present symptoms of pars interarticularis along with medication you should also apply ice for a period of about  minutes - times a day and followed by stretching exercises. a brace can also be used to relieve pain and improve symptoms. take a rest of - weeks time. in case if nothing still works then unfortunately surgery is the only option. hope this helps
many ways. e. coli is a bacteria that lives in the colon so it can be transmitted to another person by contaminated hands toilet seats objects that are contaminated with poorly-washed or unwashed hands or foods that are not washed carefully (like vegetables) or meats that are not cooked thoroughly. it can also come from contaminated water such as streams lakes or wells.
studies of the effects of exercise in preventing heart attacks have yielded conflicting results. this is likely because of the fact that people who exercise regularly generally have healthier lifestyles. many risk factors for heart disease -- weight blood pressure diabetes blood cholesterol and smoking -- can be influenced by exercise. therefore the specific role of exercise itself in heart attack prevention is difficult to isolate.
last days i also have difficulty like this but i made tattoo on my body it didn't create a problem and i also buy bunch of tattoo from <link> here i got a best collection of tattoos so don't be worried try it

migraine-specific medications usually are necessary for moderate-to-severe migraine headaches. the medications for moderate or severe migraine headaches are different than over-the-counter (otc) analgesics. instead of relieving pain they stop headaches by counteracting the cause of the headache dilation of the temporal arteries. in fact they cause narrowing of the arteries. examples of migraine-specific medications are the triptans and ergot preparations. triptans the triptans attach to serotonin receptors on the blood vessels and nerves thereby reducing inflammation and constricting the blood vessels. this stops the headache. the triptan with the longest history of use is sumatriptan (imitrex). sumatriptan is available in the u. s. as an injection oral tablet and nasal spray. zolmitriptan (zomig) and rizatriptan (maxalt) are newer triptans that are available as oral tablets and as tablets that melt in the mouth. naratriptan (amerge) almotriptan (axert) and frovatriptan (frovalan) are available only as oral tablets. traditionally triptans were prescribed for moderate or severe migraines after otc analgesics and other simple measures failed. newer studies suggest that triptans can be used as the first treatment for patients with migraines that are causing disability. (significant disability is defined as more than  days of at least % disability during a three-month period). triptans should be used early after the migraine begins before the onset of pain or when the pain is mild. using a triptan early in an attack increases its effectiveness reduces side effects and decreases the chance of recurrence of another headache during the following  hours. used early triptans can be expected to abort more than % of migraine headaches within two hours. ergots ergots like triptans are medications that abort migraine headaches. examples of ergots include ergotamine preparations (ergomar wigraine and cafergot) and dihydroergotamine preparations (migranal dhe-). ergots like triptans cause constriction of blood vessels but ergots tend to cause more constriction of vessels in the heart and other parts of the body than the triptans and their effects on the heart are more prolonged than the triptans. therefore they are not as safe as the triptans. the ergots also are more prone to cause nausea and vomiting than the triptans. the ergots can cause prolonged contraction of the uterus and miscarriages in pregnant women. midrin midrin is used to abort migraine and tension headaches. it is a combination of isometheptene (a blood vessel constrictor) acetaminophen (a pain reliever) and dichloralphenazone (a mild sedative). it is most effective if used early during a headache; however because of its potent blood vessel constricting effect it should not be used in patients with high blood pressure kidney disease glaucoma atherosclerosis liver disease or who are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors.
hi missing one pill is not so bad did you double up on saturday then? some women do that so that would have helped if not you should have still been covered. perhaps this will help slow down your anxiety's. good luck
it's a bacterial infection so it can be treated with antibiotics usually erythromycin or similar antibiotics. if antibiotics are recommended its important to take all the doses as prescribed. over-the-counter cough medicines are not recommended and don't really help. the prescription medicines that are effective for cough are strong and they're generally avoided in young children and are probably not effective for pertussis. it's commonly recommended to minimize the things that can trigger the cough. with younger kids try to keep them quiet and limit their activity. a humidifier is often used as breathing moist air can soothe the airways. infants with severe disease require hospitalization sometimes in intensive care. it can be serious enough to require intubation and ventilation -- in which a breathing tube is inserted into the throat both to protect the airways and to assist with breathing until they can recover from the infection.
most experts agree it's possible to have some sort of bariatric (weight loss) surgery after having had a fundoplication. as you probably know there are many types of bariatric surgery. some of these include: gastric bypass lap band and sleeve gastrectomy among others. your best bet is to talk to a bariatric surgeon. he or she can explain all the risks involved. depending on the type of bariatric surgery you have you may be at greater risk for certain complications since you have undergone fundoplication. these complications may include injury to the stomach and leakage. again these are potential complications you should discuss with a bariatric surgeon. when thinking about bariatric surgery it's best to find a surgeon who specializes in these procedures. ask what type(s) of bariatric surgery the surgeon performs how many procedures he or she performs each year and how often his or her patients encounter serious complications after the surgery. it's also a good idea to interview several surgeons before making a choice. you can ask for referrals to speak to former patients though health care laws may make it difficult for a doctor to provide such information. but it never hurts to ask!
i completely emphasize with you. the problem of premature ejaculation is quite common and is distressing to a young man but is seldom discussed. see most of the time the problem is secondary to the anxiety attached to your expectations in the bed. it has been wrongly projected by unscientific magazine articles and porn that a man can last for  minutes or more. honestly most of the male ejaculate before  minutes. when you are anxious about not lasting long in bed you actually do not enjoy the act of intercourse and keep on thinking about prolonging the act without enjoying it. the preoccupation and anxiety about not lasting enough in fact cause hyperarousal and lead to premature ejaculation. moreover when the male start to thrust himself into the partner the moment he undress leads to early termination of coital act (the sexual union that takes place between male and female during insertion of penis into the vagina). there are also lots of young man who are suffering from premature ejaculation without any associated anxiety or apprehension. such men as well as you may benefit by taking oral medication like tablet dapoxetine or paroxetine before sexual act. but in your case i would like to suggest relaxation techniques like breathing exercises and progressive muscular relaxation. regarding your problem pertaining to non-retractable foreskin my opinion is that you must consult a surgeon. it is always better to remove foreskin if it is causing inflammation or itchiness. non-retractable foreskin is often associated with problems of genital hygiene that may subsequently lead to chronic infections. so make an appointment with a general surgeon. for further queries consult a sexologist online --> <link>

a low hemoglobin can adversely affect the teeth but i would have no idea if your husband's severe anemia is the sole cause of his dental problems. i certainly home his doctors find the underlying cause soon.
allergies are the result of an overactive immune system. in response to a substance like pollen or pet dander the bodys natural defenses become over-activated to fight the invader.  inflammatory reactions to allergens commonly occur in areas including the eyes nose and throat. an influx of white blood cells and local release of irritating chemicals are the bodys response during an allergic reaction. swelling in the lymph nodes in the area of the neck jaw and throat can sometimes occur. however swollen lymph glands can also be caused by viral and bacterial infections and other causes. like the other symptoms of seasonal allergies swollen lymph nodes eventually go away without causing any problems. if you have lymph nodes that are persistently swollen for several weeks see your doctor for further evaluation.
plant sterols are actually quite natural. they are part of the cell membranes in plants and are structurally similar to cholesterol. in the body they go to work during digestion displacing dietary cholesterol in the cells lining the small intestine (where cholesterol is normally absorbed). what can plant sterols do in the body? according to a recent scientific review a diet enriched with plant sterols can on average reduce ldl cholesterol by approximately  percent. the favorable effect on ldl appears to be at its greatest at a dose of  grams a day. natural plant sources of plant sterols: plant sterols are found in small amounts in many healthful plant foods including grains fruits nuts and vegetables: avocado  ounces ( small) =  mg phytosterols. soybeans  cup =  mg phytosterols. chickpeas / cup =  mg phytosterols. almonds  ounce =  mg phytosterols. olive oil  tablespoon =  mg phytosterols.

"eczema is used as a general term for many types of skin inflammation (dermatitis) and allergic-type skin rashes. there are different types of eczema including allergic contact irritant and nummular eczema. several other forms have very similar symptoms. the diverse types of eczema are listed and briefly described below. atopic dermatitis is typically a more specific set of three associated conditions occurring in the same person including eczema allergies and asthma. not every component has to be present at the same time but usually these patients are prone to all of these three related conditions. types of eczema contact eczema : a localized reaction that includes redness itching and burning where the skin has come into contact with an allergen (an allergy-causing substance) or with an irritant such as an irritating acid a cleaning agent or other chemical allergic contact eczema : a red itchy weepy reaction where the skin has come into contact with a substance that the immune system recognizes as foreign such as poison ivy or certain preservatives in creams and lotions seborrheic eczema (also called seborrheic dermatitis or seborrhea): is a very common form of mild skin inflammation of unknown cause that presents as yellowish oily scaly patches of skin on the scalp face ears and occasionally other parts of the body. often this is also called dandruff in adults or ""cradle cap"" in infants. nummular eczema : coin-shaped (round) isolated patches of irritated skin -- most commonly on the arms back buttocks and lower legs -- that may be crusted scaling and extremely itchy neurodermatitis : a very particular type of dermatitis where the person frequently picks at their skin causing rashes. the underling cause may be a sensitivity or irritation which sets off a cascade of repeated itching and scratching cycles. it may be seen as scratch marks and pick marks on the skin. sometimes scaly patches of skin on the head lower legs wrists or forearms caused by a localized itch (such as an insect bite) may become intensely irritated when scratched. stasis dermatitis : a skin irritation on the lower legs generally related to circulatory problems and congestion of the leg veins. it may have a darker pigmentation light-brown or purplish-red discoloration from the congestion and back up of the blood in the leg veins. it's sometimes seen more in legs with varicose veins. dyshidrotic eczema: irritation of the skin on the palms of hands (mostly) and less commonly soles of the feet characterized by clear very deep-seated blisters that itch and burn. it's sometimes described as a ""tapioca pudding""-like rash on the palms."
sometimes the scale doesnt accurately reflect whats really happening with your body. keep in mind that your weight can fluctuate naturally throughout the course of a day. consider if youve eaten used the restroom or how well hydrated you are; all of which have a physical weight to them that can influence the number on the scale. seeing a change like loss of inches can be a great indicator of progress. see if you notice a more toned appearance or more muscle definition as well. also check to see if your clothes fit differently such as by dropping pants sizes having to take a belt in more notches or shirts being loose or not as tight. these changes in body composition can be viewed as more favorable than actual weight loss recorded on a scale. i wholly encourage you to not just view your progress through solely what the scale shows alone. if you do weigh yourself however it may be best to limit yourself to once per week just so that you can notice any weight loss trends but not enough to where youre obsessing over the numbers. keep the timing of when you weigh yourself the same to establish consistency probably first thing in the morning to help take away confounding variables.
impotence is usually referred to the inability to have an erection. assuming that you can achieve an erection you are not impotent. you may be infertile however since prostatic fluid is required to nurture sperm (from the testes) so i don't really know if this tiny amount of fluid contains sperm or not. the nature of this urethral fluid is really unclear so perhaps you can address this directly with your urologist.
a cast protects and immobilizes a fracture so that it will properly heal. most people are casted for six weeks or so (depending on the type and extent of the fracture) so entire joints are frozen in place for a long time. when the cast is removed and the fracture has sufficiently healed those immobilized tendons and muscles will need to be gradually stretched back and strengthened again. it can take a few days or longer for your range of motion to gradually return to normal. be patient. it can be sore and painful to move that joint for a while.
not enough information. i don't know the extent or location of your laceration how long ago was it stitched how it was repaired (type of sutures) and what the medical professional recommended. this answer will need to come from the person who sutured you or you will need to repost with more information. patient-specific recommendations are best so it would not be wise to rely on what other clinicians may recommend. each case is unique. in general you should not swim in a chlorine pool or natural water of any kind after receiving stiches until the wound is completely healed. many doctors recommend keeping the stitched area completely dry for the first  hours to prevent loosening of the stiches. after  hours showering may be permitted. tub soaking is contraindicated as bacteria may enter the sutured area). due to the possibility of infection from bacteria swimmining in lakes and streams with stiches is totally prohibited. hi as we don't know where it is and how big it is no unless its sea water sea water is very good for wounds helps to heal and clean all a the same time. if you cant get to the sea then a couple of handfuls of sea salt in a warm bath will help twice daily. from personal experience sea water aids healing to wounds very quickly in fact just google sea salt and wounds. do hope this helps you. good luck hi as we don't know where or what for i would stick to sea salt baths ss aids healing and cleans the wound all at the same time. for me if you can get in the sea that would be all you should do sea water. from personal experience sea salt water does help getting in the sea daily will heal things very quickly. just google sea salt and wounds. good luck stiches on end of finger not quite  hr ago had five stiches should i wash with soap and water when i take bantage off later today
"how were you diagnosed? if it was by a rapid strep test then you definitely have strep. the bicillin is really all you need. however if you were clinically diagnosed with strep (no lab test. just an exam) the diagnosis may be incorrect. since mono can mimic strep in its early stages it would not be wise to take any leftover keflex unless you have the specific ""okay"" from your medical provider. there is really only one troublesome strain of strep. and that is group a beta hemolytic strep. you cannot tell an ""unusual strain"" of strep by a rapid test (only a two day culture) so i have no idea why your aunt was told this by the er."

a thorough physical exam and a series of tests may be required to diagnose crohn's disease. blood tests may be done to check for anemia which could indicate bleeding in the intestines. blood tests may also uncover a high white blood cell count which is a sign of inflammation somewhere in the body. by testing a stool sample the doctor can tell if there is bleeding or infection in the intestines. the doctor may do an upper gastrointestinal (gi) series to look at the small intestine. for this test the patient drinks barium a chalky solution that coats the lining of the small intestine before x rays are taken. the barium shows up white on x-ray film revealing inflammation or other abnormalities in the intestine. the doctor may also do a colonoscopy. for this test the doctor inserts an endoscope-a long flexible lighted tube linked to a computer and tv monitor-into the anus to see the inside of the large intestine. the doctor will be able to see any inflammation or bleeding. during the exam the doctor may do a biopsy which involves taking a sample of tissue from the lining of the intestine to view with a microscope. if these tests show crohn's disease more x rays of both the upper and lower digestive tract may be necessary to see how much is affected by the disease.

vitamin d and  aren't linked in the sense that one causes the other but is relatively common for someone to fall short on both of these vitamins. for example people who don't eat any animal products (vegans) typically need supplemental vitamin d and  either from fortified foods or supplements. both of these vitamins are found primarily found in animal foods although plant-based products can be fortified with d such as soy milk. sunlight is another source of vitamin d. another example would be someone who had gastric bypass surgery -- they are at higher risk for vitamin d and  deficiencies. people with excess weight tend to have lower levels of vitamin d and additional  is needed after this type of surgery because absorption occurs in the stomach. a third example is someone who is elderly. they absorb less vitamin  from food and do not make as much vitamin d from the sun. work with your healthcare provider or a registered dietitian to make sure you are getting enough of both of these vitamins. there isn't a direct link between a deficiency in these two vitamins but it likely represents a common denominator. some vitamins require fat to be absorbed in the intestine. these four vitamins a d e and k require fat and a very low intake can produce a deficiency in them. damage to the pancreas or intestine can also interfere with the absorption of these vitamins. vitamin  requires a few additional modifications in the body to be absorbed. it does not require fat but a factor that is produced in the pancreas however its absorption also requires a healthy pancreas and intestinal lining.
hi it seems to be acute on chronic laryngitis. hiv is less likely as the symptoms are of very short duration and hiv takes lots of time to present itself with such complaints. influenza shot is less likely to cause these symptoms. so most probably laryngitis is the cause thanks

those are not typical symptoms of a visual acuity problem so it would be wise to see a good eye doctor for a careful examination. it would not be possible to even guess at the reasons for your array of symptoms without a hands-on evaluation. in this case first you have to consult with your doctor if the problem can solve by any medicine then why u thinking for glasses. in this case first you have to consult with your doctor if the problem can solve by any medicine then why u thinking for glasses.
you bleed from the lining that is shed from your uterus. having a tubal ligation only prevents pregnancy. it does not prevent ovulation or the cyclic changes that create your monthly period. you will continue to have periods just like before (or there could be some spotting changes in your cycle) until you go through menopause. discuss this with your gynecologist -- someone who knows your medical history.
if you fall asleep before your head hits the pillow thats not a good sign. that means youre sleep deprived okay. if you fall asleep in less than  minutes on a regular basis you probably need more sleep. if you fall asleep while driving thats a big danger zone factor a big red flag that youre going to want to understand a little bit more about. driving a car and operating a vehicle and while it may seem very rote and may seem very easy to do if you notice yourself moving over lanes not being able to stay in the lane as you normally would thats going to be a definite sign of sleep deprivation. if youre not thinking as clearly youre not making the decisions that you would normally make as quickly thats going to be a sign of sleep deprivation. and just overall movement your reaction time slows down with sleep deprivation your cognition time slows down. believe it or not even your creativity slows down with sleep deprivation. so if youre at work and youre trying to answer to a big problem or trying to understand whats going on and youre just not clicking youre not finding the words youre not doing the right thing or what you would normally do it could be a sign of sleep deprivation.
i'm sorry your husband's going through this. unfortunately we can't give you an answer here because dwi laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. what applies in your area may not apply in mine. driving under the influence of narcotics (like vicodin) is a crime in many places. however sometimes the judge takes into account whether or not the person had a valid prescription for the medication why the individual was taking that medication and so on. again we're not lawyers here and can't say what might happen in your case. i wish you all the best with this!
no the pinkish color in your mucous is most likely just blood. the nasal area is rich in blood supply so the irritation associated with a cold or allergy can cause some of these tiny blood vessels to briefly bleed. this is quite common and no cause for concern.

hi if it was a week before ok toss a coin time fact some women can get pregnant from any time of the month others it has to right day hour minute and so on. but please remember it takes male sperm  days to reach an egg if one was there but if the condom was hanging out a bit then the chances are very slim. all you can do is wait to see if you miss your next period and if you do then get an hpt or do a test at your doctors but then it could be from stress of waiting that you miss your period. all part of the game. good luck
hi karen with luck you should be ok from doing this. so you are sexual active ever thought of bc like the pill this would save all these worry's your getting and your putting a lot of stress on you. so doctor asap see him/her about the bc pill. just remember safe sex is the best sex no worry's. do hope this helps you. good luck
it's possible you could overcome delayed ejaculation by reducing the number of times you masturbate. masturbation can desensitize the penis resulting in delayed ejaculation during intercourse. please be sure to practice safe sex. using a condom not only helps prevent unwanted pregnancy it helps protect both you and your girlfriend from swapping any sexually transmitted diseases. a condom may not entirely protect you from genital warts or herpes because it doesn't cover all of the skin areas that may come into contact with infected areas. but it's better than no protection at all. if you continue to have problems reaching orgasm during intercourse i'd suggest you consult a psychotherapist who specializes in sex issues. it's possible (though not likely) there's something else going on here besides desensitization of the penis. lastly i should mention that i hope your girlfriend also is at least . otherwise you know your relationship is not exactly ethical (and not legal in many places). and that's no basis for a relationship. wishing you all the best!

medications will work properly when stored in an environment away from light heat and moisture. medications improperly stored can expire before the expiration date. using expired medication is very risky. expired medications are not only less potent but some medications become toxic when used beyond the expiration date. taking expired drugs can cause an unwanted visit to the emergency department as well having an unnecessary medical bill.

"because the teen years are a time of change with many mood swings and behaviors that seem abnormal it can be difficult to pinpoint very early signs of schizophrenia. in general however parents should look for the following in their teens: emotional reactions that are continually out of context including irrational angry or fearful outbursts. inability to sleep or difficulty concentrating in the absence of specific problems. extreme preoccupation with religion a cult or the occult. a change in personal hygiene or a loss of interest in appearance beyond what would be considered a ""fad"" shared by their peers. deterioration of academic work usually accompanied by an oblivious attitude. displaying indifference in otherwise emotionally charged social situations. persistent belief they are being watched or spied on (beyond what is normal rebellion in teens) particularly when shown evidence to the contrary. speaking or writing in a way that does not make sense to parents teachers or peers."
first err on the side of caution. always see a medical professional for any burn thats not obviously minor. that generally includes any burn that: • is large. • involves the hands feet face groin or major joints. • causes severe pain or loss of sensation. • causes skin changes besides simple redness such as blistering. • causes skin redness that does not blanch white when pressed. immediately after a burn run cool tap water over the skin for  minutes. then cool the skin with a moist compress. dont put ice butter or anything else directly on the burned skin. clean the skin gently with mild soap and tap water. take acetaminophen (tylenol) or ibuprofen (motrin aleve) for pain. simple burns involving only the very surface of the skin do not need dressings. a burn may appear minor at first but reveal itself as more severe over hours or days. burns of the hands or feet in particular can lead to disability if not treated properly. always see a doctor to evaluate a burn that looks bad or youre not sure about.
i don't think the  ailmants are related. glad you got some relief for you rib pain keep doing the peppermint thing. now go to the doctor for the urinary issue. you have the classic symptoms of a urinary tract infection. only antibiotics can help with that. you don't need to go to the er unless it is your only option. your regular physician or an urgent care facility can treat that easily. you will need to give a urine sample so make sure you drink lots of water before going.

what is going on is that you are spending too much money on pregnancy tests. call your medical provider and ask them to order a more sensitive blood pregnancy test and then make an appointment.
"first the vast majority of people who think they have ""the flu"" (influenza) do not and not all viral infections are the same. non-medical people often call any illness associated with fever or body aches as the flu. children can spread influenza (true lab diagnosed influenza) for about a week. several days longer than adults. adults and children can also be contagious a day before they develop influenza. tamiflu does reduce viral shedding if taking early. in the first  days. schools and day-care facilities tend to make up their own rules often without any medical consultation. allowing a child to return to school  hours after a fever has resolved is not a valid parameter for all illnesses including the flu. children should return to school when they are well not just fever-free. <link>"
it depends on the location of the shingles but skin-to-skin contact can definitely spread this herpes viruses. a person with active shingles is usually in pain and may not be particularly interested in sexual activity anyway.
dont pick at pimples. this only makes them worse increases the risk of scarring and makes the pimple more likely to recur in that spot. dont apply rubbing alcohol to the skin -- it has no effect on the bacteria/oils that cause acne and only dries out the skin without making the acne better. dont think that just because its not hot or sunny you dont need sunscreen. you need to apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen every day all year round even if youre not at the beach and even if its cloudy.
hmm depends on the level of cramps. it might not be what you stopped at all. strong stomach cramps can be caused by various things i don't eat sugar carbs or caffeine. the caffeine could be the number one there on the cramps. i eat vegetable's and meat mainly no coffee no sugar unless its from fruit. depending on how much caffeine you have been ingesting could be a cause / stomach is angry cause caffeine mainly stimulated it and now the muscle contractions aren't as easy as before. caffeine is a stimulant.
the income you say your son earns would make him eligible for tax credits that would lower the cost of his insurance well below the $ you cite. i suggest you shop for coverage on the marketplace. go to healthcare. gov to find the information in your state. you'll be able to plug in some of his personal information including his income and get a sense of what a policy will cost. he could pay as little as $ per month for coverage under the law.

hi.  heart with palpitations is definitly an issue that needs to be concerned about. it may be a body reaction to the energy drinks or may be due to its excessive dose that your body may not be used to. you should get a ecg and if required a  d echo of heart to see if everything is ok. drink plenty of fluids. consult a physician immediately. avoid drinking the energy drink again. thanks

the fever is harmless and will help her fight this viral infection. most patients with influenza start improving on day four so just make her comfortable. it is okay to use ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the body aches headaches etc. that go along with the flu but you really should not let the thermometer determine when you use it. her temperature does not need to be .  in order for her to get well. it's okay to treat the fever to make her feel better but it is not medically necessary. make sure you are giving the proper dose of ibuprofen for her weight. many parents under-dose their teenagers.

a bulging eardrum can cause vertigo due to the pressure. this usually means a middle ear infection but cephalexin would not be my drug of choice to treat this in an adult although i don't know your dosage or medication history. the medicine probably is not your culprit but rather your ear disorder. vertigo is also common in inner ear infections and these are often viral. viral infections do not respond to any antibiotic therapy. since i have no way of knowing your diagnosis or severity of symptoms you will need to consult your medical provider if you are not getting better.

"sexual excitation leading to an ejaculation is controlled in the brain not the penis. the fact that you can continue to have sexual activity after ejaculation is really good so that first ""fast one"" is really not that problematic (other than changing condoms). yes there are some special techniques you can employ to postpone ejaculation if you have a cooperative partner. a little research on the internet for ""premature ejaculation techniques"" would likely provide you will ample information. no there are not special foods that will increase your sexual stimina but if you eat a lot of garlic your partner is unlikely to have sex with you at all! hi there is a little exercise called edging very good for you problem. for info on this just google prgym look under exercises this is not a quick fix once you get this working you may just need to do it a couple of times a week to keep it working. good luck"

there are many types of stds so it would be impossible to make that important determination based solely on your symptoms. you are the one who agreed to the unprotected sex so you are the one responsible to get examined and properly tested. it would be so much simplier (and less expensive) to just insist on a partner using a condom. no condom. no sex. no exceptions.
you will need to see a medical provider or a psychiatrist so that you can be properly assessed. there are many prescription medications that can help you. if i was you i would go to a good dr & have a checkup & talk there are some  medications out there today i know as i am on  lots of antidepressants &  is going to be the best year ever after  bad relationships  councillors & a physic lady & a new dr i am doing wonderful it took me  & a half mths before my new drug kicked in there is hope out there as my neice told me it is easier to stay up than get up one of the things even if you don't feel like doing it is getting up & being normal you will get there i had to do this & it was hard work i tell you but it gets easier & going to bed @ normal hours & plan your day & do everything you normally do ask you dr for a mild anti anxiety drug too until the other anti depressants kick in good luck
"i'm sorry to hear you're experiencing this. if by ""feels like it will explode"" you mean you feel increased pressure in your head whenever you bend or cough this is a cause for concern. as you know plavix (generic name: clopidogrel ) is a blood thinner. obviously when taking a blood thinner you don't want to break a blood vessel -- especially one in your head. i'd advise you to see your doctor as soon as possible about this. he or she will be able to determine if you should continue using the clopidogrel (plavix) or whether a different medication (or none at all) may be more appropriate for you. in the meantime exercise caution when bending lifting or coughing. if you need to use throat lozenges for example to calm a dry throat please do so. i wish you all the best!"

this would be highly unlikely. first don't use someone else'sbath towel and you won't have to worry. remember what they wipe first and wipe last! if you are talking about a hand towel then sometimes it is best to shake dry rather than use someone's wet towel. stds are almost always transmitted the ol' fashioned way: by sexual activity. as long as you are very careful and diligent in safe-sex practices you should avoid any std.

hi found this on this site<link> its about all i can find doing research on it. theres more on site just copy into google to the www. to open and read. our data show that a combination of metformin and contraceptive pill may be more effective in suppressing the hyperandrogenemia of obese and non-obese pcos patients than metformin alone and may reduce insulin levels more than contraceptive pill alone. hence combined treatment may become a more effective therapeutic option for pcos. so what its saying isit would not harm the bc pills is this for weight loss? hope it helps you. good luck

"because you only spray on a thin layer cooking sprays are great for sautéing vegetables and lean meats with a small amount of oil. if you check the ingredients label you will see the primary ingredient is vegetable oil. while some are flavored to taste like butter others are flavored to taste like olive oil and may even contain some olive oil. here is an example list of ingredients in one brand of butter-flavored pan spray: soybean oil (adds a very small amount of fat) soy lecithin natural flavors dimethyl silicone (for anti-foaming) beta-carotene (for color) propellant. keep in mind that even cooking sprays labeled as ""zero calories"" can actually contain less than  calorie per serving. so they're not completely calorie free. you can actually make your own cooking spray by buying a spray bottle and filling it with healthy oil such as canola or olive oil."

"you should consult the medical provider who examined you. the one who knows that type of ear infection you have (i am guessing a ""middle"" ear infection) the severity and the type of antibiotics you are taking. not all middle ear infections will be problematic after a few days but since i do not know the details of your case you need to get patient-specific advice from someone who has examined you. or have someone examine your ears just prior to your journey."
hi if she has no symptoms then i do not feel there is need to take her to doctor. anyway her eyesight has been lost so no point in examination until she has any other associated symptoms. thanks
cataracts occur when the natural clear lens inside the eye located behind the iris becomes cloudy over time. this lens is important for focusing light on the back of the eye (the retina) so that images appear clear and without distortion and the clouding of this lens during cataract formation distorts vision. cataracts are usually a very gradual process of normal aging but can occasionally develop rapidly. they commonly affect both eyes but it is not uncommon for a cataract in one eye to advance more rapidly. cataracts are very common affecting roughly % of people over the age of  and over .  million cataract surgeries are performed in the united states each year. precisely why cataracts occur is unknown; however most cataracts appear to be caused by changes in the protein structures within the lens that occur over many years and cause the lens to become cloudy. rarely cataracts can be present at birth or in early childhood as a result of hereditary enzyme defects. severe trauma to the eye eye surgery or intraocular inflammation can also cause cataracts to develop more rapidly. other factors that may lead to the development of cataracts at an earlier age include excessive ultraviolet light exposure diabetes smoking or the use of certain medications such as oral topical or inhaled steroids. other medications that are more weakly associated with cataracts include the long-term use of statins and phenothiazines. experts have estimated that in the united states visual disability associated with cataracts accounts for over  million physician office visits a year. this number will likely continue to increase as the proportion of people over the age of  rises. when people develop cataracts they begin to have difficulty doing activities they enjoy. some of the most common complaints include difficulty driving at night reading or traveling. these are all activities for which clear vision is essential.
yes your girlfriend can get pregnant from precum. that's why you always use a condom. in this case your girlfriend is probably not pregnant because she took the plan b pill in timely fashion and precum also has lower concentrations of semen than regular ejaculation. if you're going to have unprotected sex be sure to always use some sort of birth control.
shingles is when the chicken pox virus stays dormant in the body and reawaken into a different and more aggressive form of the virus. this is a life long viral condition that can't be transferred to animals. animals can not have the same diseases or conditions as us because the biological composition is not nearly the same. the only way they can get infected is by the virus to evolve into same thing compatible with its immune system. the chemical recognition or better yet lack of will not allow them to become infected with human viruses.
you cannot adequately or accurately determine a specific cause of vaginal itching or irritation over the internet but the most likely cause would be yeast. keep using your vaginal yeast medication including some topical anti-yeast cream on your itchy areas. if this does not help you may need to see your medical provider for a proper examination.
actually tegretol is perfect and definitely it takes time to show results well but you need to be having a better even slow progression with convulsions. if the convulsions are getting worse or not responding completely to that treatment then a modification is going to be needed. concerning the speech a speech therapist should be consulted and he can arrange speech therapy sessions for helping her through it. i recommend a hearing test mri of brain.
cystic fibrosis (cf) is a chronic progressive condition that affects the body's respiratory and digestive systems. it is due to a gene defect. people who have cf produce abnormally thick sticky mucus which clogs the lungs and leads to repeated lung and sinus infections as well as difficulty breathing. the thick mucus also obstructs the ducts of the pancreas preventing digestive enzymes from reaching the intestines. because so little food is absorbed children with cf have difficulty gaining and maintaining weight. cf also affects the reproductive systems of both males and females. females with cf may have difficulty getting pregnant. males with cf are almost always sterile because they produce relatively few or no sperm.
no head lice does not leave bumps or bruising but depending on how often they bite you an area it can become sore. if you are worried about lice there is a place in tigard and beaverton i believe called lice knowing you that check and treat for lice. if it is something you cannot afford at least do buy lice comb from there because their combs are % more effective than drug store combs. you can still buy one from the drug store and if you do not have olive oil or coconut oil buy some and some plastic shower caps. after that go home and apply alive oil to everyone's hair make sure you get it everywhere then put the caps on and either sleep with the olive oil on and wash it off i'm the morning or just put the blow dryer over your head for thirty minutes. before you wash out the olive oil though get everyone's laundry in the laundry room put stuffed animals in large garbage bags for three weeks or just toss them in the dryer for thirty minutes on high and vacuum everything.

com most metals used in surgery are titanium which is used because it causes the least amount of allergic reactions per   patients but it is still possible to be allergic to it. also many pins clips and sutures labeled and marketed as titanium actually have small impurities metals such as nickel which are more likely to cause allergic reaction.
silicone-containing products are excellent at providing a light smooth emollient to repair dry flaky skin. they have also been found to improve the appearance of scars. it is an inert ingredient with a very good safety profile. it should not clog pores because its large molecules actually allow for the passage of gaseous molecules making it very breathable.
"you are correct. levoquin is an antibiotic and antibiotics do not work for viruses. the diagnosis of ""viral bronchitis"" is usually based solely on a clinical assumption since the medical provider probably did not perform a plethora of diagnostic tests that would confirm it. in the outside chance that a viral bronchitis could progress to a secondary bacterial infection a clinician may still empirically prescribe an antibiotic. since i do not know the details of the case or the medical history i cannot comment whether this antibiotic was warranted or not."
well it's certainly not a situation anyone wants to be in. extremely low blood sugar levels can lead to coma -- which isn't a good outcome. the quickest remedy for a very low blood sugar level is. sugar. in the hospital we administer dextrose via iv line. assuming you're awake and alert and realize your blood sugar has dipped you can eat a sugary treat such as a small candy bar to bring your sugar level back up. note: no one should attempt to feed sugar to an unconscious or unresponsive person even if you know low blood sugar is the cause. you should call -- or your local emergency number instead. of course it's not a good idea to ever let your blood sugar level get too low. one goal of diabetes management is to maintain blood sugar within a therapeutic range. for adults that might be between  and  milligrams/deciliter (mg/dl). you should try to avoid peaks and valleys in your blood sugar levels. that said if you go around measuring your blood sugar every hour you're going to find you do indeed have some peaks and valleys throughout the day. that's normal. you should measure your blood sugar at the appropriate times and eat a balanced diet that includes several healthy snacks throughout the day to keep your blood sugar as level as possible. if you have any questions about diabetes management ask your doctor or your diabetes nurse educator. they're the experts who can give you all the specific information you need for your personal health situation. wishing you well!
i have never heard this. i have heard that it's important for seniors and young children to get the flu shot because they are at higher risk of having a severe case of flu or death. i make sure my children get a flu shot every year although they are never happy about it! here's some information from the cdc: <link> <link>

based on what you have shared your condition may be normal for you. seeing a medical professional to make sure everything is fine is a good decision and will give you the reassurance that you need. many men have tight foreskins that require some minor medical intervention (usually a prescription cream) and some are born with shorter foreskins that may not fully cover the entire head of the penis as you mature. since i can't examine you over the internet see a medical professional that can render an opinion.
this is a great question as patients seek alternatives to medications and health care. drug supplements are not regulated by the fda like prescription and over-the-counter medications which have to prove their safety and efficacy. i generally do not recommend supplements because they are risky. if you have a tooth problem and do not have insurance i recommend you check out the health resources and services administration (hrsa) web site for federally funded health centers near you: <link> these health centers exist in urban and rural settings and provide medical care preventative care and dental care and prescription drugs for folks without insurance. payment is based on your income and what you can afford.
they are both antihistamines. the zyrtec is purported to be a non-sedating antihistamine and diphenhydramine (benadryl) is a sedating antihistamine. when used as a sleep aid it can interfere with deep restful dream-like states so personally i am not a big fan of using it. if he wants to use both then just take the zyrtec in the morning (the diphenhydramine wears off in about  hours so it will be gone).
you can test anytime. most home pregnancy tests these days can be used within days after a missed period. i recommend testing first thing in the morning when your urine is the most concentrated. home pregnancy tests detect the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg) in the urine so testing when the urine is most concentrated should give you the most accurate result. also be sure to follow the package instructions to the letter as they all have different timing requirements. not all women experience implantation cramping or bleeding. if you do experience it it usually occurs between  and  days after fertilization of the egg. the cramping and spotting shouldn't last long. i'm wishing you the test result you desire whatever it may be!

i recommend speaking with your health care provider as soon as possible because topamax is not recommended for use in pregnant women because it may cause harm to the fetus. your health care provider needs to re-evaluate your condition and truly talk with you about the risks versus the benefits.
acetaminophen is used more as a fever reducer and for pain. ibuprofen which is also known as motrin or advil can be used for pain that's caused by inflammation. so the theory is is that if the area is inflamed that's really what's causing the pain. acetaminophen or tylenol is also referred to as apap in some formulations. you want to be careful. you want to make sure that you don't exceed more than   milligrams a day for an adult. if you are an elderly person you don't want to exceed   milligrams a day and you would want to avoid things like alcohol. they are noticing that there have been some challenges with acetaminophen in the cases of people taking too much of it. they weren't aware that they were taking prescription medications with acetaminophen in it. so you want to talk to your pharmacist first before you consider choosing these products. on the advil/motrin side once again you don't want to drink alcohol with them. it really helps create nausea. it could upset the stomach. if you have an ulcer it's not recommended. if you have asthma it's not recommended either because ibuprofen is a sister to aspirin and it could trigger an asthma attack. that's really some people are very sensitive to this class and that's why they shouldn't be taking it. so once again you want to come to the pharmacy you want to ask for the pharmacist. you want to come with your medication list show us what you are taking and then tell us what are your symptoms. in some cases if you have had a pain for a while we might refer you to a doctor or a healthcare provider to have it further evaluated.
i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. the fear of having cancer must be very tough for you to cope with. i'm glad to hear you have a mammogram scheduled. that is a good starting point and it sounds like your health care provider is on top of your situation. while you wait try to remember that worrying will only cause you misery and can even have a negative impact on your immune system. look for support from family and friends. try to distract yourself. focus on the many positive things in your life no matter how small they may seem. if you can try to get a massage or otherwise pamper yourself to relieve your excessive stress. even though you have a family history of cancer it's not a sure bet you have cancer too. it's entirely possible your breast lump is benign (non-cancerous) and that your other symptoms can be attributed to a virus or even stress. i know it's hard but try to work on reducing your stress level and staying as healthy as possible as you work through the process of getting a diagnosis. take care of yourself!

hi prenatal are for when you get pregnant. but getting pregnant is all down to timing timing works like this with your cycle day  is the first day of your period around day  is ovulation day or the day your egg drops in to your womb so you need to have unprotected sex around  days before this it takes male sperm  days to reach your womb they can then live in there for up to  days max so by having sex when i said there waiting for your egg if this works you should get impletion spotting around day  if this carries on and you miss your period you then do a test hpt or get a test done at your doctors if positive you can then take your prenatal vit's. do hope this helps you. good luck ps try not having sex to often other wise the sperm will be immature and this will not get you pregnant.

"his pediatrician or pediatric urologist will need to examine him. it is not possible to offer you a definitive answer based solely on your description. yes it could be an inguinal hernia or a hydrocele. a torsion (twisting) is also possible but these are very painful and quite serious. i suspect he would be in obvious pain if this is happening but torsions can occur and quickly ""de-torse"" in some children. either way an examine will be required to make that important determination. if he is in pain due to this swelling or if the swelling is becoming larger an emergency room visit is warranted and an scrotal ultrasound is usually ordered to help make the diagnosis."

i applaud your decision and fortitude in quitting smoking when you got pregnant. it's not easy to quit and you should pat yourself on the back! while i sympathize with (and support) your sentiments the truth is no one person can ethically coerce another person to do their bidding. it probably will be harmful to the baby to be raised in an environment filled with cigarette smoke. studies confirm a link between infant exposure to second-hand smoke and asthma rates. nonetheless you cannot force your husband to quit smoking. each person has to come to that decision on his or her own. can you compromise and convince your husband to smoke outdoors only? this would benefit his child and at the same time allow him to live the lifestyle he chooses. it also might make it easier for you to maintain your personal smoke-free lifestyle. i wish i had more to offer but your husband is going to do what he's going to do. you have to do what you need to do. and i'm glad you chose to quit smoking!
that's a great question and many people in your situation have been wondering about this. the good news is if you are already covered by medicare you are all set. you needn't worry about the new health insurance marketplaces or any changes to your existing coverage.
what an interesting question! urine color can be an important tool in diagnosing illness. for example red or pink urine can be caused by blood but it also can be caused by eating beets or rhubarb. interesting right? ! green urine frequently is caused by dyes such as those found in vitamins. however green urine also can indicate a urinary tract infection caused by a specific bug called pseudomonas bacteria. while the cause of green urine generally isn't harmful if you have any of these additional symptoms you should see a doctor: frequent urge to urinate (pee) bladder pain pain with urination (peeing) cloudy urine fever and/or chills nausea and/or vomiting these symptoms can indicate a urinary tract infection which needs to be treated by a health care professional. hope this helps!
ive decided that one of the keys to eating healthy while traveling for work or on vacation is a mini fridge especially when you need energy to compete as an athlete. on a recent week-long road trip with my daughter (who was dancing about eight hours a day) we stocked the hotel mini fridge with water chocolate milk apples protein bars and string cheese. on top of the mini fridge we stashed some bananas and nuts. this made it that much easier for my daughter to grab a few things on her way out in the morning. plus it was much more convenient to fuel up on a nutrient-rich snack or beverage in the evening when she had some downtime from dancing. the same would hold true for any athlete health-minded vacationer or time-crunched businessman or woman.

that would be a difficult question to answer without the ability to examine you. cold and influenza are viruses and tend to cause similar symptoms. influenza tends to be worse usually with a fever response (not just hot or cold flashes). influenza is a respiratory viruses some abdominal symptoms are not typical in adults (kids with flu can get them though). if i had to take a guess i would say that you most likely have a nasty viral infection but not necessarily influenza. the only way to be sure is to have a rapid flu test. if you have been ill for less than two days antiviral medications like tamiflu can be used. there is really nothing that can be done for a cold other than symptom control. treating the symptoms of colds and flu is often the only thing that can be done; trying to feel better while nature orchestrates the cure. both colds and flu last about a week with the first - days being the worst.
hi you are almost having like bronchitis symptoms which is turned on with cool air and temperature changes if you are having a dry cough this will cause irritation and scratching of the throat causing some blood to come out if so then you can just take an anti histamine once daily to avoid the symptoms if your cough is productive of sputum then you will need to get an expectorant and drink plenty of warm fluids
i would not advise the use of epson salts on the eyes. this is likely to burn like crazy; perhaps making the condition worse. a boric acid solution or other eye washes available at the pharmacy would be better. there are over-the-counter eye drops that can help itching as well. red itchy eyes can be conjunctivitis which may be viral or allergic so if this does not resolve he will need to seek medical care.

"hi this first piece of info is from the uks nhs its a bit like your abama scheme but has been running since the end of . what if i didnt have sex? its possible for you to get pregnant without having sexual intercourse (penetration) if for example: sperm get into your vagina – for example if you or your partner have semen or pre-ejaculate on your fingers and touch your vagina your partner ejaculates near your vagina your partners erect penis comes into contact with your body near your vagina the risk of getting pregnant in this way is very low because sperm can only live for a short time outside of the body. however if youre not planning a pregnancy its important to know that its possible to get pregnant in this way. by the way are you natural with pubic hair or shaved? dr. hector chapa answered: if sperm gets around the outside of the vagina how likely is it to get pregnant? not likely for conception to occur several finely tuned processes must occur all in perfect order. first of which is cervical bathing/coating by sperm. the reason this is needed is because of all the volume deposited at the cervix some will leak out some will never enter the cervix some will die in the uterine cavity. sperm deposited on the exterior of the vagina can't ""migrate"" into the vaginal canal. dr. tony t. ho answered: my semen came into contact outside of her vagina by my penis i didn't release sperm there. she also has sist in her overy. could she get pregnant? always possible any time there is contact of semen to a woman's genital vault there is the possibility of pregnancy. it doesn't sound like it's very likely in this situation but you won't get a ""no it's not possible"" here. have her do a pregnancy test in  weeks to be sure. dr. ravi d. chauhan answered: if sperm gets on or around my vagina can i get pregnant? yes in a fertile woman any contact of sperm with the vaginal tissues can result in conception."
it is extremely unlikely that bacteria would grow on a toilet seat then get into a persons vagina or urethra. i guess the chances of this happening maybe one in  
nearly all naturally occurring water sources contain fluoride a mineral that has been proven to prevent and even reverse tooth decay. tooth decay is caused by certain bacteria in the mouth. when a person eats sugar and other refined carbohydrates these bacteria produce acid that removes minerals from the surface of the tooth. fluoride helps to remineralize tooth surfaces and prevents cavities from continuing to form.

hi yes this rash can be due to sjorgens syndrome and is quite common to happen. like your earlier rash even this will go away in a few days. if it doesnt then you can consult a skin specialist to rule out other causes. thanks.
why are you going to the emergency room. about once a week? you need to find a good internist for on-going comprehensive continuity care. not treat 'em and street 'em care. when you go to the er you often see different medical providers. none of which will follow your case and they will devote their time and efforts to the life-threating problems they may encounter. it is not the anemia that is troubling. it is the reason you are anemic that is the underlying issue.
 weeks after surgery and having such symptoms should be investigated well do cbc is the operated part is inflammed or something do u see any strange vaginal discharge?
hi apart from the discharge the rest of your problems could relate to early menopause the only way you can sort that bit out would be to get a blood test done this would show were your hormones are its were your hormones are that will tell you whole you doing. the discharge may just be from your last period. do hope this helps you. good luck
i would buy a real aloe vera plant. cut off a leaf slicing open one side and pealing it open to expose the center scrape the jelly off apply to wound and only if you have to cover it like you would any other wound. since the aloe dries and is absorbed quickly you should apply frequently using as much of one leaf as possible before using another leaf. it helps with the stinging/burning sensation and helps the wound heal quickly.
what you're describing sounds like typical positioning for the laparascopic oopherectomy. as a former surgical nurse i helped position plenty of patients as you describe. i can't think of any reason why this positioning would aggravate your cervical spine or cause back spasms because the downward gravitational force on the spine while in the lithotomy position with trendelenburg (with the feet elevated - degrees) is lower than the force on the spine when walking for example. certainly if your surgeon anesthesiologist or circulating rn thought the positioning would aggravate your spine issues they would not have done it. in the operating room we take positioning extremely seriously are very careful regarding these issues. so sorry to hear you're dealing with the back issues and hope you can get yourself fixed up soon!
a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) is based on your symptoms medical history and a physical examination. your doctor may also want a mental health assessment which is an evaluation of your emotional functioning and your ability to think reason and remember (cognitive functioning). a mental health assessment may include an examination of your nervous system written or verbal tests and laboratory tests (such as blood and urine tests) as well as a review of your appearance mood behavior thinking reasoning memory and ability to express yourself. many people with ocd live with the condition for years before being diagnosed or they go without treatment because they are afraid or embarrassed to talk about their symptoms. answers to three initial questions may help your health professional diagnose whether you have ocd:  do you have repeated thoughts that cause anxiety and that you cannot get rid of no matter how hard you try? do you wash your hands frequently or keep things extremely clean and neat? do you excessively check things? if your health professional suspects you have ocd he or she will look for a full range of symptoms that will confirm the diagnosis including:  recurrent and persistent thoughts impulses or images that are intrusive and inappropriate cause anxiety or distress and are not simply excessive worries about real-life issues. attempts to suppress or ignore the thoughts or get rid of them with other thoughts or actions. a recognition that the obsessions are created in your own mind and don't make sense. repetitive behaviors such as hand-washing ordering praying or checking that you're driven to do in response to the obsession. the behaviors are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing a dreaded event. for a diagnosis of ocd the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (more than  hour a day) or greatly interfere with your normal routine at work or school and affect social activities and relationships. early detection early detection and proper treatment is very important in improving the course of ocd. this disorder is often a long-lasting (chronic) condition that will need to be monitored throughout your life. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

the only potential for interaction on your list of medications is that taking verapamil with zocor can increase the levels of zocor and make a patient more likely to experience side effects from the zocor like muscle pain. if you are worried about drug interactions it is important that you only use one pharmacy to fill all of your prescriptions so that the pharmacist can properly screen for interactions. and talk to your pharmacist. they can provide you all the information you need to take your medications safely.

i think they generally do and unfortunately men handle it in a way that is counter productive. we have noticed that more men will begin to drink alcohol excessively and that is probably because they want to be seen as strong and if they go to a doctor for any kind of help with this it will mean that they are not men so better to drink and try to drink your troubles away than to try and get some help. women on the other hand will say look if im this stressed ive got to go get some help. we know that more women enter therapy than man. that has always been as long as i can remember and theyve been keeping statistics that women are willing to talk to others and to try to come to terms with how do i cope with this how can i change this what am i missing they will talk about their problems. men will talk about the baseball scores. they wont talk about their problems. thats why the statistics are skewed probably that they say that women have more anxiety and depression than men. no its because more women show up at the office and get counted and men dont get counted. if we went into bars and started doing some kind of research i would wonder before they took their first drink how would they register on stress measures on anxiety depression measures and i think we would find a rather dramatic shift. you know what is stopping them what is so unmanly about getting help when you need it. if you have hypertension and you are a man you go and get help. is that unmanly? no. if you have anxiety and stress that is causing you serious problems and can end up in a heart attack is that unmanly or should you go and get some help just the way you got with your hypertension. remember these kinds of illnesses are just as important and can have as catastrophic results as the medical illnesses that youve accepted all these years.
no. only u. s. citizens and legal immigrants can apply.
you have had bloody stools for five years? and tears? and a nickle-sized growth for three years? you are either very tolerant of these symptom or very reluctant to see a medical provider about them. either way my advice is for you to be properly examined. the nature of these things cannot be blindly determined by a vague description. one possibility comes to mind (there are many) and that would be pilonidal sinus tracts. these occur in the gluteal fold (butt crack) and can last a long long time. they become infected quite often resuting in drainage and pain. the cause of your bloody stools can be related to this or it could be an entirely different problem. and any of these problems could be serious. you must see a medical provider or better yet a proctologist.

"there is nothing wrong. you are completely normal. this phenomenon is quite common and is often referred to as a ""wet dream"". in most cases you were having an erotic or sex-related dream (perhaps one you did not remember when you awoke) and your excited brain (which controls erections and ejaculation) went into full mode just like you are having sex for real. in a way this is among the safest sex of all. no risk of a sexually transmitted disease or unintended pregnancies. you may have to do some laundry however."

ringworm of the scalp or beard is treated with antifungal pills in combination with antifungal shampoo or lotion. topical antifungal medicines such as shampoos or lotions that you apply directly to the infected area do not work when used alone because they cannot get deep enough into the infected hair shaft to kill fungi there. but antifungal shampoo helps prevent spreading the fungus to other people because it decreases fungal shedding from the scalp or beard area. doctors also recommend occasional use of antifungal shampoos for ringworm carriers people who can spread the fungus but do not have ringworm symptoms. often an adult becomes a carrier after exposure to an infected child. what to think about ringworm of the scalp or beard can come back after treatment has cleared the infection. ringworm of the scalp or beard can cause scarring and permanent hair loss. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.
"because there are different types of ""ablation surgery "" it's not possible to accurately answer your question but here is some general information. your surgeon's office or the hospital should give you some written instructions about what medications you may and may not take prior to your procedure. if you did not receive any pre-operative teaching you should call your surgeon's office and ask when you will receive this information. if your procedure is scheduled for tomorrow then i would advise not taking any advil (ibuprofen) within  hours of your surgery. in general you should avoid taking any non-prescription medication before surgery. again you should receive written instructions before any type of surgical procedure. each surgery and surgeon have different restrictions on what medications you may take when you need to stop eating and drinking and other pre-operative procedures. best wishes on your procedure. i hope it goes well!"
i understand your concern. actually there is no treatment or medicine to prevent ectopic pregnancy. only thing to look for is to avoid using copper-t for contraception as this may increase the chance of ectopic pregnancy in case you conceive. take care to get an early ultrasound as soon as you discover pregnancy next time. also there is high chance of around %-% to get your next pregnancy too as ectopic. no process or medicine is available presently to prevent this condition. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>
"little ""eye boogers"" are just fine. this is just thickened tears. many babies have narrow nasolacrimal ducts -- the tiny drainage ducts from the corner of the eyes to the nose. if the tears can't drain down the ducts for whatever reason they will accumulate in the mornings or after naps. most (not all) tear drainage ducts will open up fully after about a year old. if the conjunctiva is red or irriated then a mild infection could also do this."

seventy percent of teens diagnosed when they are younger continue to have symptoms of their adhd that affect their functioning as adolescents. once your son stops taking his medication (concerta) his symptoms will return relatively quickly. unless he has learned other compensatory techniques or has outside help his symptoms will affect both his academic performance in school and his relationships with others. if he is driving he may have more difficulty focusing and with distractibility. teens with untreated adhd tend to have more car accidents and get more speeding tickets. all of this should be explained to him and i would suggest that he go in for a visit to discuss this and his decision to stop his medication with his health care provider. i often use this situation as an opportunity for the teen to learn more about how his adhd affects him and why or whether he need to continue his medication to treat his symptoms.
hi if your white count is up then something somewhere is doing it would not like to speculate on what. good luck
"no canker sores (aphthous ulcers) resolve on their own over time. lidocaine will not cure them but it takes away some of the discomfort during the natural healing process. try using listerine and gargle with it for as long as you can stand. it will burn but it will also heal any sores in your mouth or throat. repeat  or  times a day the sores will be gone in no time. can be followed by cold  to cool painful sores. lidocaine is a topical analgesic it is a pain killer and really has no properties to ""cure"" anything it just makes it feel better while it heals."

folic acid can reduce your risk of having a baby with a serious birth defect of the brain and spinal cord called the neural tube. a baby with spina bifida the most common neural tube defect is born with a spine that is not closed. the exposed nerves are damaged leaving the child with varying degrees of paralysis incontinence and sometimes mental retardation. neural tube defects develop in the first  days after conception before many women realize they are pregnant. because about half of all pregnancies are unplanned the department of health recommends that you take  micrograms of folic acid each day while you are trying to conceive and should continue taking this dose for the first  weeks of pregnancy. a woman who has had a prior child with a neural tube defect should discuss the appropriate dose of folic acid with her doctor before her next pregnancy. studies have shown that taking a larger dose (up to   micrograms) at least one month before and during the first trimester may be beneficial. there are natural sources of folic acid: green leafy vegetables nuts beans and citrus fruits. it is also found in many fortified breakfast cereals and some vitamin supplements. calcium during pregnancy can prevent a new mother from losing her own bone density as the fetus uses the mineral for bone growth. iron helps both the mother and baby's blood carry oxygen. while a daily vitamin supplement is no substitute for a healthy diet most women need supplements to make sure they get adequate levels of these minerals.

"that is typical. there can be hundreds of causes of tinnitus (ringing) and it is actually rare that a specific cause is found. i know. i have had tinnitus myself for well over a decade. all of my tests were blind alleys like i expected. the ent is really obligated to search for a cause (like an acoustic neuroma) but these are rarely found. most of the time the ent just throws in the towel and essentially tells you to just ""live with it"". and so we must. there are treatments that help you cope with tinnitus but it is unlikely that you will find a miraculous cure. it can just go away (which is nice) but it has a good chance of staying with you for a long long time. i wish i had better new for you but tinnitus is perhaps one of the most difficult medical problems to investigate and one of the most difficult to treat."
hi do try seeing your doctor there really good at telling if your pregnant. would be a good place to start. hope this helps you. good luck
your health care costs may go up -- they tend to every year -- but not much of the higher costs are likely to be because of health reform. employers continue to shift more health care costs onto employees as a way of keeping their own costs under control. and despite the high cost because employers tend to cover a big portion of your premium and because your employer-sponsored health insurance is a tax-free benefit it's often the best deal in town. still you may want to consider other plan options if your employer gives you a choice. there may be another alternative that will cost you less money but still cover your medical needs. you can read further about employer vs. marketplace plans at the health reform  blog: <link>.

(please clear any kind of exercise program with your physician and fitness professional especially if you have any physical disability or restrictions. ) . squats: squats are your mainstay for building and strengthening your buns. stand with feet hip-width apart and hold weights at shoulder level or at your sides. bend the knees and lower into a squat keeping the knees behind the toes. imagine that youre sticking your butt out behind you but keep the torso upright and contracted. press into the heels to stand up. repeat for - sets of - reps. . wall sit: stand about  feet in front of a wall and lean against it. slide down until your knees are at about -degree angles and hold keeping the abs contracted for - seconds. come back to start and repeat holding the squat at different angles to work the lower body in different ways. to add intensity hold weights or squeeze a ball between the knees. . leg press: here youll be pushing a weight or resistance away from yourself using your legs. this can be done with gym equipment or bands. . lunges: these exercises come in a variety of forms. the traditional lunge goes forward with weights and a bent knee or there is the assisted lunge with no weight and you can hold onto a wall or chair. or you can try a lunge that requires a much smaller range of motion lowering your body only part way. . dead lift: this exercise is not meant for everyone. it targets the lower back glutes and hamstrings. if you have any problems with these muscles dont do a dead lift. this exercise simulates what we do all day long as we bend over and pick things up. . hip extension: this is one of my favorite exercises to strengthen the glutes. stand facing a wall placing both palms on the wall and with a straight back simply push one leg out behind you as high as you can go keeping the back and leg straight. do this  times switching legs each time. or you can get on the floor on all fours and take one leg and simply stretch it straight behind you. do this  times switching legs each time. if you use ankle weights you can add more intensity for a real glute challenge.
"at  years of age the ""normal"" blood pressure range is close to the same as it is for an adult. generally speaking the normal blood pressure range for an  year old boy or girl is around / to / or thereabouts. however this range can vary depending on many factors such as the fitness level of the child. a skinny kid who plays a lot of soccer probably will have a lower blood pressure than a larger kid who isn't very active. in that respect blood pressure in children isn't much different from blood pressure in adults. if you have concerns about your child's blood pressure you should consult your pediatrician. hope this helps!"

bactrim may not work after the first pill. your doctor could have given you some pyridium to help the urinary pain but since he/she did not keep drinking tons of water and take that bactrim as prescribed. unless you had a urine culture there is really no way to know if bactrim was the appropriate antibiotic for this particular uti but if you do not improve or getting worse there is a very good chance that the antibiotic may need to be changed or other causes investigated that can cause uti-like symptoms.

i'm sorry you're dealing with an abnormal pap smear result. before i get to your questions about hpv let's back up for just a moment. an abnormal pap smear does not necessarily indicate you have human papillomavirus (hpv). the pap test specifically screens women for cervical cancer. an abnormal pap result does not mean you have cervical cancer. in fact most abnormal pap test results are not cancer at all. certainly hpv can cause cervical cancer. however you need to receive a special test (not unlike a pap test actually) in which the cells of your cervix are tested for hpv. in answer to your question hpv is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases. the centers for disease control estimate as many as % of sexually active men and women get hpv at some point in their lives. often people who are infected with it have no symptoms. so while it's not exactly true to say hpv can lie dormant in your system it is accurate to say you can be infected with hpv and live with it for many years without knowing it. your gynecologist probably will want to discuss your abnormal pap test result with you. when that happens you will have the opportunity to discuss your concerns about hpv. i hope you find this response helpful!
hi i found this for you it may help in your condition ie i mean getting over your problem. its from the uk nhs. how long it is advisable to wait before you try for another pregnancy will depend on your specific circumstances. your doctor should be able to advise you when (or if) it will be safe to do so. in most cases it is recommended that you wait for at least two full menstrual cycles before trying for another pregnancy as this will allow time for your fallopian tubes to recover. however if you were treated with methotrexate it is usually recommended that you wait at least three months. nevertheless many women are not emotionally ready to try for another pregnancy so soon. your chances of having a successful pregnancy will depend on the underlying health of your fallopian tubes. in general % of women achieve a successful pregnancy  months after having an ectopic pregnancy. good luck

"a new study says the amount of time spent on social networking sites like facebook youtube and linkedin doesn't affect how much sleep college students get each night. i'm very skeptical of this study though i should note that it wasn't done on american students. the very next day i read about another study -- this one done on u. s. soil by the kaiser family foundation -- that states plainly how connected our kids are these days. . a problem? social media is here to stay. but that doesn't mean that parents can't take back the power and instill good habits in their kids when it comes to using social media responsibly. there have been plenty of other studies done to support the idea that all these digital distractions do in fact interfere with a good night's sleep. so with all this in mind i hope that parents increasingly consider establishing better ground rules at home. think about setting ""curfews"" for electronic usage in the power down hour before bedtime. this includes television computer cell phones ipods and portable players like dvds. your teenager might not like it but his or her mind and body (and bed! ) will."

lorcet contains a different pain medication than percocet so there could be a possibility that you are allergic to the lorcet. stomach upset is common in pain medications so you can also try taking the medication with some food (more of a meal rather than some crackers). i would suggest that you talk to your health care provider about your reaction to lorcet and also let your pharmacist know. they can put a note in your profile about this reaction.

travel insurance operates under different regulations than other health insurance. however a pre-existing health condition is a condition that you previously had and were treated for. the fact that it's now healed is irrelevant in the insurer's eyes. from your description it sounds like you did fracture your  vertebrae prior to applying for coverage. if that's accurate then you do in fact have a pre-existing condition and assuming travel insurers are allowed to consider that when you apply for coverage (insurers of major medical health plans cannot) the insurer could use that to deny you coverage or charge you more for a policy.
don't try and diagnose yourself. you do not have to be sexually-active to get balanitis; children can get it. it is very common in uncircumcised men and boys. hydrocortisone only handles inflammation. it is the cause of the inflammation that needs to be specifically addressed. you could have a yeast infection (monilial balanitis) or even a bacterial secondary infection. this may self-resolve or you may need to see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated.

"i'm sorry to hear you've lost a contact lens in your eye. it's not as uncommon as you might think! the good news is it's impossible for a contact lens to actually get behind your eye. usually what happens when a soft contact lens magically disappears is it gets dislodged from the cornea and stuck under the upper eyelid. sometimes a soft lens can get folded in half so when you eventually find it it may look distorted. you can usually get the lens unstuck by put some wetting solution into your eye and blinking rapidly several time to bring the lens into view. if that doesn't work try adding more wetting solution and gently turning your upper eyelid inside-out. this can ""pop"" the lens away from the upper lid. if none of these solutions work you can always call your eye care professional for more advice or even an exam to find that darn contact lens and get it out! hope this helps!"

in all probability what you're experiencing is simply irritation and dryness of the nipple which can be fixed by applying moisturizer. that said the full answer is a bit more complicated. the fact you're having pain throughout the whole breast presents something of a red flag. i'd suggest you see your primary care provider to have this more fully evaluated. obviously you don't want to take any chances that this is something more serious that just dry skin. even if you've had normal mammograms in the past tenderness in the breast is something to get evaluated. with luck it will turn out to be something simple but you'll get some peace of mind by having your health care provider evaluate this. good luck to you! regardless of your age clothes rubbing on your nipples can cause irritation. my wife was having the same problem. i suggested clear double sided tape. as crazy as it sounds it worked.
children can get hpv from their mother during a vaginal birth if the mother is infected. hpv on the outside of the skin can be transmitted to others by direct contact during skin-to-skin sexual play. hpv can be contracted from oral sex if one partner has the virus orally. most of the times however hpv that is detected on a woman's cervix has gotten there just one way. through sexual contact.
the allergic symptoms usually aggravate during winter season. it continues from november till february based on the climate in your place. you have not mentioned about the allergic site (nose or lung or skin). if it is nose or lung the dryness due to winter can trigger the allergic response in nose. in this situation you need to maintain moisture by just applying a drop of coconut oil in each nostril before going to bed. on the other hand you can apply a drop of anu thailam (an ayurvedic nasal drops for allergy) in each nostril before going to bed. during evenings and nights when it is too cold you need to protect your ears (by keeping cotton plug) nose (by applying oil drops) head (by covering head with a woolen cap) and hands and feet (by wearing gloves and socks). the external cold stimulus triggers the allergic response. so prevent yourself from the cold stimulus to avoid allergy. if you have allergic asthma then it is better to practice pranayama and yoga. breathing exercises will help you. if you have allergic skin disorder then you can use vaseline or vegetable oils to gently apply on the skin. this helps in overcoming the dryness due to the cold climate. the skin manifestation should also be examined by a physician to decide the proper medication. revert back to an ayurveda specialist online for further follow up --> <link>

it may not be arthritis at all. if it is on the bottom of your feet it could be plantar fascitis. see a podiatrist for a proper examination and treatment which could be as simple as getting different shoes to special orthotics (shoe inserts). arthritis can also be improved by using nsaids (a class of drugs that includes ibuprofen and naproxyn).
the diagnosis of inguinal hernia is usually based on your medical history and a physical exam. tests such as ultrasound and ct scans are not usually needed to diagnose an inguinal hernia. in most cases a doctor can identify an inguinal hernia during a physical exam. an examination of urine ( urinalysis ) may be done to rule out a urinary tract infection. a urinary tract infection or kidney stone may cause pain in the groin that can be mistaken for hernia pain. further tests may be done to rule out other conditions that could be contributing to the hernia such as colon or prostate cancer or lung diseases that cause chronic coughing. if surgery is planned other tests may be needed to evaluate the status of any current health problems such as lung heart or bleeding problems. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.
"first let me say i'm sorry to hear you or someone you love is suffering from lung cancer. that's a difficult diagnosis to cope with. it's not uncommon to suffer from back pain due to lung cancer. please talk to your cancer doctor about the medication options available to you to relieve this pain. narcotic medications ranging from pills to patches may be prescribed for severe pain related to cancer. on your own you might try a heating pad set to ""low"" for about  minutes at a time. do not place the heating pad directly against the skin because you could get burned. instead place a towel between the heating pad and your skin. if that doesn't work you also may try an icepack. again no more than  minutes at a time and never directly touching the skin. sometimes the combination of heat and ice helps relieve pain. the best solution is to speak with your cancer doctor about how to deal with this. if the back pain is a new symptom your health care provider may want to run further tests to determine what's causing it. best wishes to you!"
we don't think it is serious. it may go away within - days if it does not consult a doctor.
hi these symptoms can occur due to oversensitive ears especially the nerves in the internal ear. you should get a thorough examination of the internal ear from a ent spcialist through otoscopy. inflammed nerves in the ear can also cause this. you can take vitamin tablets and see the difference. use cotton ear buds to avoid cold air and high noise. thanks

oily hair is a natural production. if you wash your hair frequently it causes your body to produce more oil. the less you wash it the more the production slows down. ways to absorb body oil is to use baby powder. just use a small amount at the roots and pat the white color out. some hair salons have colored hair powder that can be used if you do not like the white powder. as for the face or skin a light lotion that is less greasy should be applied as a moisturizer. there are also face towelettes that can be used to blot the face and eliminate oil and perspiration.
genital herpes is suspected when multiple painful blisters occur in a sexually exposed area. during the initial outbreak fluid from the blisters may be sent to the laboratory to try and culture the virus but cultures only return a positive result in about % of those infected. in other words a negative test result from a blister is not as helpful as a positive test result because the test may be a false-negative test. however if a sample of a fluid-filled blister (in the early stage before it dries up and crusts) tests positive for herpes the test result is very reliable. cultures taken during an initial outbreak of the condition are more likely to be positive for the presence of hsv than cultures from subsequent outbreaks. there are also blood tests that can detect antibodies to the herpes viruses that can be useful in some situations. these tests are specific for hsv- or hsv- and are able to demonstrate that a person has been infected at some point in time with the virus and they may be useful in identifying infection that does not produce characteristic symptoms. however because false-positive results can occur and because the test results are not always clear-cut they are not recommended for routine use in screening low-risk populations for hsv infection. other diagnostic tests such as polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to identify the genetic material of the virus and rapid fluorescent antibody screening tests are used to identify hsv in some laboratories.
it could be hundreds of different dermatological conditions and it would be impossible to blindly guess what you have over the internet. since this has been going on for two months perhaps it is time for you to see a medical professional / dermatologist so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated.
"no no and no. at one month old your baby is not physically developed enough to ingest cereals yet. when you introduce solid foods too early (and rice cereal constitutes ""solid food"" in baby language) you can increase your baby's risk of developing a food allergy later. it's not uncommon for babies to get gassy when they nurse whether from breast or bottle. if you feel your baby is having problems feeding please call your pediatrician or lactation consultant. they will provide you with all the information you need to make sure your baby gets adequate nutrition that's appropriate for his age. i wish you and your beautiful baby all the best!"

i just read your query. in ayurveda or any other branch of medicine there is no medication that will help you to conceive a baby boy. no medication can do that. moreover the chromosome responsible for baby boy (y chromosome) is inherited by the male partner that means the gender of a baby whether it is a boy or a girl is determined by father and not by mother. some people claim that they give medicine for baby boy and promote them in the name of ayurveda medicine but no medicine can do that. for further doubts consult an ayurveda specialist online --> <link>
three kinds of programs help people learn about osteoarthritis and self-care and improve their good-health attitude: patient education programs arthritis self-management programs arthritis support groups. these programs teach people about osteoarthritis and its treatments. they also have clear and long-lasting benefits. people in these programs learn to: exercise and relax talk with their doctor or other health-care providers solve problems. people with osteoarthritis find that self-management programs help them: understand the disease reduce pain while staying active cope with their body mind and emotions have more control over the disease live an active independent life. people with a good-health attitude: focus on what they can do not what they can't do focus on their strengths not their weaknesses break down activities into small tasks that are easy to manage build fitness and healthy eating into their daily routines develop ways to lower and manage stress balance rest with activity develop a support system of family friends and health-care providers.
the mainstay of treatments are still oral and or topical antibiotics along with benzoyl peroxide washes and topical retinoids. in severe cases a type of surgery called marsupialization can be done to more definitively treat the condition; however there is often scarring from the procedure so it is often reserved for the worst cases. oral isotretinoin is also used with some benefit in getting the condition under control; however topical treatments are needed to maintain clearance over time.

"diagnosing your medical condition will require a through patient interview detailing past medical conditions confirming when symptoms first appeared family history age sex medications being taken pain quality (describing your pain as burning after eating may suggest a gastric type of disturbance) and a physical examination. it can be a time consuming challenge to both you and your medical professional to eventually come-up with an accurate diagnosis. one point to note is that some pain can be characterized as ""referred pain"". that is pain originating from one anatomical location but causing pain in another location. a differential type of diagnosing technique may be employed and require more blood studies cardiac testing c. t. scans x-rays and other testing. some common disturbances were addressed in the emergency room but a boatload of other possible medical conditions still remain. upper right abdominal pain can be caused by many medical conditions including: gastric disturbances - pancreatitis irritable bowel syndrome lactose intolerance crohn's disease intestinal obstruction ulcers and others. liver conditions - gallstones viral hepatitis cholecystitis and others. allergic conditions such as angioedema. renal system conditions - kidney stones pyelonephritis and others. cancer - bowel lesions and others. respiratory conditions such as pneumonia. cardiovascular disease - your symptoms will require the painstaking investigative work by a competent and methodical physician. one- by- one all possible causes must be eliminated until only one remains."
testosterone is the major male hormone. there are three different types of blood tests that can be used to measure testosterone levels. so the first step in understanding your level is to find out which test was used and the normal range for men in your age group. total testosterone is the most common test used. it measures all the testosterone in your blood. a typical range for men over  is - ng/dl but the results vary depending on the lab used. you can also measure free testosterone. free testosterone is a measure of the testosterone that is not bound to proteins in the blood. a typical range for men is - ng/dl. obesity affects the level of sex hormone binding proteins so your doctor may order a free testosterone level if you are obese. historically it was thought that only free testosterone was able to exert hormonal effects. we now know that testosterone bound to the protein albumin can also exert effects. bioavailable testosterone measures this level. bioavailable testosterone varies depending on the age of the man. for a man in his s the normal range of bioavailable testosterone would be - ng/dl but for a man in his s it would be - ng/dl. normal ranges differ depending on the laboratory used so be sure to discuss with your doctor what is the appropriate normal range for the lab where the test was done. if your testosterone level is low it is important to re-test the level to determine if a lab error or just a daily variation has occurred. the amount of testosterone varies at different times of the day so this is a blood test that needs to be repeated before making medical decisions. it is always important to make sure lab tests correlates with your symptoms. low testosterone levels in men causes decreased sexual desire erectile dysfunction and infertility. however testosterone also has other important functions. it affects behavior muscle mass and bone density. therefore a man with low testosterone can develop osteoporosis. finally in understanding testosterone levels your doctor needs to determine whether the root of the problem is a result of a problem in the testicles where testosterone is produced or if there is a problem in the part of the brain that controls the production of testosterone. measuring lh and fsh hormones produced in the pituitary of the brain will help make that distinction. once this information is available your doctor can decide how you need to be treated. testosterone replacement in the form of a patch gel or injection is usually given. but as with all medications there are cautions. testosterone can increase the size of the prostate and may cause worsening symptoms in men with benign prostatic hypertrophy and aggravate prostate cancer. so talk with your doctor to understand your test and his concerns.

you do not have to treat a fever especially one this low. fever is the body's normal response to fighting off an infection or inflammation. it is okay to give her some ibuprofen (much better than acetaminophen/tylenol) to make her feel better but you do not have to treat a fever. fevers are not only harmless they are therapeutic. the cause of a fever can be in the thousands so please see her medical provider if she continues to be ill after two more days or any time that you feel it is needed.

that depends on the degree and location of the curvature(s). since chronic lower back pain is one of the most common adult complaints it may not be related to adolescent scoliosis at all. most scoliosis curves tend to be higher in the thoracic and upper lumbar area.
"it sounds like you're doing a good job caring for your post-surgical wounds. be sure to keep following all the post-surgical instructions you were given. the risk of infection for your procedure is relatively low. the classic signs of infection are: fever loss of appetite feeling like you're coming down with the flu severe pain/swelling/bleeding in the surgical area. if the ""gooey pus"" you're seeing is yellowish in color chances are good this is not an infection. as the skin heals itself it tends to over-produce protein cells. these cells look kind of yellow gooey and sticky. if that's what you're seeing it's probably a normal part of the healing process. don't scrub these cells off. just gently wash with warm soapy water and rinse well. if your surgeon told you to use antibiotic ointment like bacitracin then continue to do so according to the post-surgical instructions you were given. as your wounds heal you also can apply a vitamin a & vitamin d ointment (often used for diaper rash) to help your skin heal. if you develop a fever or any other signs of a true infection contact your healthcare provider immediately."
unless there was some news that i have not heard tetracycline is still safe and readily available by prescription. you would need to ask her or your pharmacist why she apparently can't get it.
most helpful answer it is difficult to say whether or not you have anorexia based on the limited information you provide but what you are doing is problematic and could lead to an eating disorder. the signs and symptoms of anorexia include but are not limited to restricting food fear of gaining weight body weight of % ideal or less and exercising too much. here are more of the signs including physical symptoms. i suggest you get a physical and take care of yourself. if you are asking the question it is likely you could use some support either form a dietitian or psychologist who specializes in eating disorders. while you may not have an eating disorder disordered eating (eating too much or too little/obsessing about food) is very common and can have negative effects. don't delay getting help! your health and well being depend on it.

unfortunately people with low incomes living in states that chose not to expand their medicaid programs like florida are often left without good coverage options just as they were before the affordable care act became law. but you may be misinformed about what you are and are not eligible for. your roommate's income for example doesn't count toward your household income simply because you share a home. you would need to file taxes together in order for your incomes to impact one another for health insurance subsidies. open enrollment is now closed for the year but if you recently lost your job and health insurance you may qualify for a special enrollment period. if you do you might be eligible for private insurance at highly subsidized rates. i suggest you go to healthcare. gov and perhaps pick up the phone to speak with someone to make sure you've explored all of your options.
there is some basic research and data that suggest that the phytosterols -- including beta-sitosterol that is found in pumpkin seeds -- can block the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (dht). less dht theoretically means less hair follicle miniaturization. however no formal clinical trials have been performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of ingesting phytosterols to promote hair health or growth.

i suspect that she does know she is peeing in her pants during the day. she just doesn't care. she is busy playing and it is just easier to pee than interrupt what you are doing. so it back to square one with some remedial training. if she understands money give her a bag of quarters and tell her that she can keep all of the ones that are left at the end of the week. but if she pees in her pants she has to pay you two of the quarters (you can up the price as the training continues). soon she will get the idea. you will need to remind her to pee at least every hour or two so set the timer on the stove to buzz when it is time for her to go pee. if she does give her a quarter for her bag. good luck.
i do not know of any contraindications for exercise restriction while anyone is on cipro or for months after. any restrictions that your doctor recommended has nothing to do with the medication but your other health concerns. since i do not know you full medical history it is best to get patient-specific exercise parameters from your doctor -- someone who does have this information.
if this situation has come on suddenly and is accompanied by any of these symptoms please seek immediate medical attention: symptoms of stroke. i'm not trying to alarm you in any way but time is of the essence when it comes to stroke. do not think your age means it's impossible to have a stroke. strokes are on the rise among younger people especially those with risk factors such as obesity diabetes or hypertension. i hope this turns out to be nothing but it's better to be safe than sorry. best wishes to you!
hi its not safe to inject clexane in a bruise. there seems something wrong in the dosage of clexane that you have been taking. you should stop taking it and consult a doctor before restarting it. thanks
allow me to clearly address all of the points included with your question as follows: yes a  year old can become a victim of hepatitis a; an individual does not always become nauseous with hepatitis a; dark urine and fatigue are only a few of the possible signs seen with hepatitis a. other symptoms may include poor appetite yellowing of the eyes and/or skin known as jaundice muscular pain fever pain in the right abdominal side and clay colored stools; hepatitis a is not always obtained through sexual contact. hepatitis a is contagious and may be passed on through living in close quarters with an infected person through eating at unsanitary restaurants or having sexual contact with an infected person. dark urine may be a result of taking some medications ingesting various foods liver and kidney disease or urinary infections. because your negative symptoms are limited to having dark urine and fatigue i suspect that a urinary track infection is more likely than having contracted hepatitis a. please consider seeing a physician to have diagnostic testing completed.
most helpful answer hi found you a some links that should help you. <link> this next link goes more for enemas so this conflicts with the link above but do love the idea of using a spray in the above one. <link> this does say about using water and vinegar. and last this one lots of info. <link> just copy links one at a time into google to the www. to open and read. do hope this helps you. good luck for what reason? there is no literature that specifically mentions any problems with doing this so it would not be harmful. it is unnecessary and non-therapeutic however.

transmission by bathing would not be very likely although it can be passed in a shower (you stand on the shower floor and the next person stands there and may get exposed). fungus does pass from person to person but not as easily as people believe. transmission requires close and frequent contact and a person who my be particularly susceptible to getting it.

i suggest you visit a dentist and get your teeth cleaned for gum pain and bleeding. for yellow teeth use baking soda salt and lemon juice paste to brush your teeth and then use normal tooth paste. use this paste twice a week only and it will give you good whitening. also you should maintain oral hygiene properly and use mouthwash after brushing. you can use peel of banana to rub on teeth for whitening but that is not applicable everywhere. visit the dentist soon to get relief from gum pain and bleeding. wish you a good dental health and happiness. for further information consult a dentist online --> <link>

we have a patient here who has two very serious medical conditions; diabetes and high blood pressure. most likely too as a pharmacist i am going to ask on what medications they're on and i guarantee they're on quite a few. with acai berry we don't have any data on whether or not it interacts with medications and when you have something like cardiovascular disease and diabetes it's probably better to be safe than sorry. we have patients who end up taking these products because they think that they're natural and they're safe and they're not going to do anything. well most cases end up in the emergency room.
hi look if your that worried why you here you should be outside an std/gum clinic waiting to get in there you will get a test if they think you have something or they will test you just to make sure you are clear this is the help you need they will put you straight. ok good luck

do blood test. to confirm urine test is not conclusive.
vertigo can have hundreds of different causes. it would be impossible to determine a specific cause blindly over the internet. you will need to see your medical provider so you can be properly examined to narrow down the many many possibilities.
only you would really know that possible outcome. if you have been using any type of drug from cannabis to others. and depending on the type and sensitivity of the drug test recent use may be revealed. needless to say the best way to pass a random drug screen is to not use drugs.
"""convince"" a reluctant ""child"" to get a flu shot? who is the adult and who is the child. there's no convincing a child. i've seen bribery done. if it was my situation the child would have learned right from the beginning that sometimes we must do things that aren't the most pleasant but will be over soon. never lie to a child and say it won't hurt. there was one thing i taught and allowed my children to do for a shot: either alone or accompanied by me to sing as loud as possible happy birthday. it always worked and they always wanted me to sing along loud. of course the dr. was warned first."

pneumonia itself is not contagious. in other words exposure to someone with pneumonia will not necessarily cause pneumonia in you. but that doesn't mean you can't get sick. pneumonia can be caused by hundreds of different viruses bacteria and even fungi. it is the organism/pathogen that may be contagious not the end-disease caused by that pathogen like pneumonia.
everyone has a different level of energy so radiation treatment will affect each patient differently. patients frequently experience fatigue after several weeks of treatment. for most patients this fatigue is mild. however a loss of energy may require other patients to change their daily routine. if your doctor thinks it may be necessary for you to limit your activity he or she will discuss it with you. to minimize fatigue while you are receiving radiation treatment: be sure to get enough rest. eat a well-balanced nutritious diet. pace your activities and plan frequent rest periods.
give it a rest my friend. the penis is like any other part of the body. it can become bruised (inside) and become sore with use. if you rubbed one of your fingers like that on a regular basis i suspect you could get a sore finger! as you know i cannot examine your sore penis over the internet so if your symptoms persist you will need to have a visit with a medical provider hopefully an understanding (male) provider who can provide you with some confidential advice. because your penis is sore limit your masturbation a bit until your symptoms improve. you can still achieve self-pleasure by being a bit more gentle with your tender part. you might want to look into using a penis health creme my friend. these cremes are made just for guys who masturbate a lot and it will help with soreness chafing and rough or dry skin. easy to use and totally safe too. you should check it out.
yeast infections when cured should not become recurrent in males. only if one is having constant sex with a partner who does have recurrent infections. now when ever something is wrong. get it looked at. it is not normal to have a rash on your penis. a penis looks a certain way. and any abnormality is just that an abnormality. and if things aren't normal that more often than not means something is wrong. there is a condition not dangerous at all called pearly penile papules. it looks like a rash on ur penis. it can go away and then come back. it does not burn or itch. it just makes it bumpy. that sounds like something u should look into. so don't panic just yet. but get it looked at as soon as you can.
this concerns me too and i want to urge you to make an appointment with your health care provider to have this checked out. it's impossible to say what's going on without doing a physical examination lab work and so on. but the situation you describe doesn't sound normal to me and i think it warrants an investigation. i hope i'm not alarming you. i don't think you need to run to the emergency room or anything like that. there could be a very simple reason why you're experiencing this big belly issue but i don't want you to delay getting checked out by your primary care provider. i wish you all the best! i have the same problem. my doctor order a cat scan but my insurance did not approved it jet. did you find out what was your problem?
yes you could still be pregnant. some women will have period like symptoms at the beginning of their pregnancy. if you do not have any cramping i wouldn't worry. i would retest and go speak with your doctor right away!
research shows that regular exercise reduces symptoms of moderate depression and enhances psychological fitness. exercise can even produce changes in certain chemical levels in the body which can have an effect on the psychological state. endorphins are hormones in the brain associated with a happy positive feeling. a low level of endorphins is associated with depression. during exercise plasma levels of this substance increase. this may help to ease symptoms of depression. a national health and nutrition survey found that physically active people were half as likely to be depressed. exercise also boosts the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain. neurotransmitters are chemicals that send specific messages from one brain cell to another. though only a small percentage of all serotonin is located in the brain this neurotransmitter is thought to play a key role in keeping your mood calm.

"with proper therapy the children with arthritis will usually improve over time. indeed the vast majority of children with arthritis grow up to lead normal lives without significant difficulty. even for severe cases with proper medications proper physical and occupational therapy and proper surgery if necessary virtually no one with arthritis should need a wheelchair. everyone's doctor knows stories of children who looked awful but did very well or looked like it was ""nothing serious "" who became very sick. but these are the rare exceptions. there are many recent significant improvements in treating children with arthritis. for over % of the children with arthritis today we don't need new drugs or miraculous inventions. we just need proper application of the resources we already have. there are three important things for every child or adolescent with arthritis. first is proper recognition and diagnosis of the disease. second is proper treatment by an experienced physician with multidisciplinary support including physical and occupational therapists and orthopedic surgeons. third is proper education of the patient and family. people with arthritis are no different than everyone else in the world. they all need to grow up have jobs get married and have families. some will have some difficulty with mechanical problems. many will have small things they can't do if you watch them carefully. few will go on to be professional athletes or military officers but even fewer will be ""totally disabled"" by their disease. there are far more children who are disabled because they are told they couldn't do things than children who are really disabled by their disease. we should never accept a child with arthritis being told to use a wheelchair. in almost every case it is hoped that we will be able to correct the problem and get them walking again. this is why educating the public and physicians is so important. it must be appreciated that children can develop arthritis and must be properly diagnosed and treated. each child should be able to reach his or her full potential. children with arthritis should be treated just like everyone else. they need the same discipline the same allowance the same grades and the same respect as all the other children. arthritis might affect the body but it must never be allowed to affect the mind."
the u. s. food and drug administration (fda) assigns a category system to classify the possible risks to a fetus when a specific medicine is taken during pregnancy. xanax and its generic (alprazolam) have been assigned pregnancy category d meaning this class of medication have shown clear evidence of risk to the fetus in studies. pregnancy category d is a stronger warning class than pregnancy categories c or b classifications. a pregnancy category d medicine may still be given to a pregnant woman if the health care provider believes that the benefits to the woman outweigh the possible risks to the unborn child. i would not just stop taking the medication if you are concerned that you may be causing harm to your baby. work with your health care provider to decide whether you should be taking the medication. if you reach a decision to not take the medication any longer work with your provider or pharmacist to taper (decrease gradually) the dose to take and to prevent withdrawal symptoms. common withdrawal symptoms consist of but are not limited to nausea vomiting diarrhea increased heart rate palpitations hallucinations memory loss confusion panic attacks seizures dizziness headaches depression and insomnia. it is important to work with your health care provider to make sure you are getting the best care possible. one side effect is clef lip to your unborn child
antibiotic treatment when taken exactly as directed normally cures chlamydia infections. if antibiotics are not taken properly the infection will not be cured. prompt treatment prevents the spread of the infection and reduces the risk of complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease (pid). avoid sexual contact or use condoms until you and your partner have finished the full course of medicine. medication choices antibiotics what to think about call your doctor if symptoms continue or new symptoms develop  to  weeks after treatment. to prevent reinfection your sex partners need to be tested and treated. treatment in a hospital with intravenous (iv) medicines may be needed for women who have pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) and men who have epididymitis. in many cases these conditions can be treated outside of the hospital with oral antibiotics and close follow-up by your doctor. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.
you can also advocate for yourself once you know this. . start at a dose lower than that usually advocated by the fda. do this for a few days to get your body and brain used to  in order to hopefully lower your side effect risks. . increase and take the lowest fda dose for four to six weeks. . if you are not better increase to the middle dose for four to six weeks. . if you are not better increase to the highest fda dose for four to six weeks. if you and your doctor accomplish this then you have had a 'full trial' of the antidepressant. if the full trial has failed ask your doctor for another similar trial ideally of an antidepressant  works on a different set of neurotransmitters. do not stay on the same low dosed antidepressant for several months if it is not helping.
it is not possible to determine the nature of a rash based on a vague description so you will need to see a medical provider so you can have this all-over rash properly examined diagnosed and treated. since you are concerned that this could be a consequence of unprotected sex seeing a medical provider is even more important. if necessary the medical provider can test you for hiv and other sexually-transmitted diseases. you should get tested. but you might just have dry skin. this is very common. as far as the penis is concerned you should use a creme called  man oil. it is the best penis skin moisturizer around and will keep things in good shape down there. i've used it for years and i love it. good luck.
i can help you with advice but unfortunately a brief description is not sufficient to be able to offer you a definite answer as to the nature of your breast lump. you will need to see your medical provider for a careful examination and perhaps some imaging studies. many lumps on younger women are cysts but this important call cannot be made blindly. you must have a proper examination.
doctors can usually identify shingles when they see an area of rash around the left or right side of your body. if a diagnosis of shingles is not clear your doctor may order lab tests most commonly herpes tests on cells taken from a blister. if there is reason to think that shingles is present your doctor may not wait to perform tests before treating you with antiviral medicines. early treatment may help shorten the length of the illness and prevent complications such as postherpetic neuralgia. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.
typically each kind of herpes stays with it's area. so if you have oral herpes it doesn't spread to the genitals and vice versa. however a huge percentage of people get cold sores which is a mild non harmful condition caused by herpes simplex  so it might look like the genital herpes might have spread.
pregnancy is really about numbers: one of your wife's eggs available for fertilization (at the time of ovulation) and a few hundred million of your sperm waiting around for that egg to emerge. the odd are really in favor of fertilization in most cases. having sex everyday is just fine. you don't really have to wait and store up a volume of semen (the bulk of an ejaculation is not sperm but semen from the prostate gland). the more sperm that is ready and waiting the better. the color or consistency is not something you should worry about. the semen really needs to be where you can't see it if you know what i mean. assuming everything is in order the frequency that you have sex the volume of your semen will not be a major factor in achieving a successful pregnancy but you do have to have sex so get off of the computer and go for it.
it is usually not necessary to take two antihistamines on the same day but there are exceptions. claritin is given once per day but depending on the time you took it it could be wearing off around bedtime for instance. since benadryl can be very sedatiing and only lasts for about  hours a person could take it even though the claritin was still on-board.

a parent can take birth control (pills? ) away from an under-age child (if they find them) but the child can just go out to planned parenthood or other clinic and get them again without parental permission. taking away birth control pills does not keep a young woman from having sex so the parent should be very cautious about doing this. as a matter of fact they should be proud that their teenage daughter has taken the initiative in preventing an unwanted pregnancy. it is time for the child and the parent to have a good talk. also remember that not all birth control prescriptions are for contraception. they are also used to help regulate menstrual cycles prevent ovarian cysts and to treat acne.
i can't examine your ear over the internet but i suspect your olive oil-based ear drops have softened/liquefied your ear wax to the point where you now have a complete blockage lying against your eardrum. if you are not having any ear pain or signs of an ear infection you can safely wash out your ear with a gentle stream of warm water (you can use an ear syringe or the shower). this will likely dislodge this waxy mass and your hearing will be miraculously improved. do not use q-tips or you will pack the wax in more tightly.
you can certainly get trichomoniasis from a man (it lives in the urinary tract) but this parasite will not really cause prostate infections. the prostate infection was likely due to another pathogen.
"atopic dermatitis atopic dermatitis is a chronic skin disease characterized by itchy inflamed skin and is the most common cause of eczema. factors that may cause atopic dermatitis (allergens) include environmental factors like molds pollen or pollutants; contact irritants like soaps detergents nickel (in jewelry) or perfumes; food allergies; or other allergies. when the disease starts in infancy it is sometimes termed infantile eczema. atopic dermatitis tends to run in families and people who develop the condition often have a family history of other allergic conditions such as asthma or hay fever. contact eczema contact eczema (contact dermatitis) is a localized reaction that includes redness itching and burning in areas where the skin has come into contact with an allergen (an allergy-causing substance to which an individual is sensitized) or with a general irritant such as an acid a cleaning agent or other chemical. due to the vast number of substances with which individuals have contact it can be difficult to determine the trigger for contact dermatitis. the condition is sometimes referred to as allergic contact eczema. skin reactions to poison ivy and poison sumac are examples of allergic contact eczema. people who have a history of allergies have an increased risk for developing contact eczema. seborrheic eczema seborrheic eczema (seborrheic dermatitis) is a form of skin inflammation of unknown cause. the signs and symptoms of seborrheic eczema include yellowish oily scaly patches of skin on the scalp face and occasionally other parts of the body. dandruff and ""cradle cap"" in infants are examples of seborrheic eczema. this condition tends to run in families. emotional stress oily skin infrequent shampooing and weather conditions may all increase a person's risk of developing seborrheic eczema. nummular eczema nummular eczema (nummular dermatitis) is characterized by coin-shaped patches of irritated skin -- most commonly located on the arms back buttocks and lower legs -- that may be crusted scaling and extremely itchy. this form of eczema is relatively uncommon and occurs most frequently in elderly men. nummular eczema is usually a chronic condition. a personal or family history of atopic dermatitis asthma or allergies increases the risk of developing the condition. neurodermatitis neurodermatitis also known as lichen simplex chronicus is a chronic skin inflammation caused by a scratch-itch cycle that begins with a localized itch (such as an insect bite) that becomes intensely irritated when scratched. women are more commonly affected by neurodermatitis than men and the condition is most frequent in people - years of age. this form of eczema results in scaly patches of skin on the head lower legs wrists or forearms. stasis dermatitis stasis dermatitis is a skin irritation on the lower legs generally related to the circulatory problem known as venous insufficiency in which the function of the valves within the veins has been compromised. stasis dermatitis occurs almost exclusively in middle-aged and elderly people with approximately %-% of the population over  years of age being affected by the condition. symptoms include itching and/or reddish-brown discoloration of the skin on one or both legs. dyshidrotic eczema dyshidrotic eczema (dyshidrotic dermatitis) is an irritation of the skin on the palms of hands and soles of the feet characterized by clear deep blisters that itch and burn. the cause of dyshidrotic eczema is unknown. this form of eczema occurs in up to % of people with hand eczema and is more common during the spring and summer months and in warmer climates."
hi summer is not a good time to get a cold they are real buggers to shake off it will take time just live with and slowly it will go. good luck but try this a good old cheese and onion sandwich could work wonders for you keep the cheese thick and the onion as well eat these  times a day the last one just before going to bed. for that extra kick slice some garlic into them.
most helpful answer how about seeing a medical provider today so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated. you may need a prescription antibiotic.
i don't know. i do not know anything about your daughter; not even her age and more importantly. i have no way of examining her over the internet take a detailed medical history or run any diagnostic tests. you will need to have your daughter examined by a medical professional.
no it is not normal. and three months is long enough to have bleeding while on the birth control pill. basically you may need a higher dose pill to control this breakthrough bleeding. if you primary care medical provider is not experienced in doing these adjustments see a gynecologist to get you started on a different oral contraceptive. this can be fixed.

to diagnose anemia your doctor will likely ask you about your medical history perform a physical exam and order blood tests. you can help by providing detailed answers about your symptoms family medical history diet medications you take alcohol intake and ethnic background. your doctor will look for symptoms of anemia and other physical clues that might point to a cause. there are basically three different causes of anemia: blood loss; decreased or faulty red blood cell production; or destruction of red blood cells. blood tests will not only confirm the diagnosis of anemia but also help point to the underlying condition. tests might include: complete blood count (cbc) which determines the number size volume and hemoglobin content of red blood cells blood iron level and your serum ferritin level the best indicators of your body's total iron stores levels of vitamin  and folate vitamins necessary for red blood cell production special blood tests to detect rare causes of anemia such as an immune attack on your red blood cells red blood cell fragility and defects of enzymes hemoglobin and clotting reticulocyte count bilirubin and other blood and urine tests to determine if you have a hemolytic anemia where your red blood cells have a shortened life span. only in rare cases will a doctor need to remove a sample of bone marrow to determine the cause of your anemia.
"one of the questions i have to ask is ""how long have you had the rash? "" sometimes people break out from foods new laundry detergents or new soap. this could be a possible cause if it not due to the bed bugs. due to the fact you're pregnant i would recommend using a colloidal oatmeal bath like aveeno and if it continues see your health care provider."
no don't worry it could be a normal cough reflex. next time be careful while swallowing or drinking.

bacterial vaginosis often clears up on its own. but in some women it doesn't go away on its own and for many women it comes back after it has cleared up. antibiotic treatment works for some women but not others. about  out of  women find that bacterial vaginosis clears up without medicine after a week.  bacterial vaginosis recurs in about  out of  treated women.  complications your risk of complications from bacterial vaginosis is higher: during pregnancy. compared to pregnant women who don't have it women who have bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy have a higher risk of early (preterm) delivery or uterine infection after pregnancy. also pregnant women may have an increased risk of miscarriage. after gynecological surgery. women with bacterial vaginosis at the time of an invasive vaginal procedure have an increased risk of developing more serious infection or inflammation such as pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) or endometritis. surgical procedures linked to bacterial vaginosis-related infection include endometrial biopsy surgical abortion hysterectomy intrauterine device (iud) placement cesarean section dilation and curettage (d&amp;c) and an x-ray test that examines the inside of the uterus the fallopian tubes and surrounding area ( hysterosalpingography ).  when exposed to hiv or other sexually transmitted diseases. women who have bacterial vaginosis when they are exposed to sexually transmitted diseases (including hiv ) have an increased risk of becoming infected with the sexually transmitted disease.  webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

severe nutritional deficiencies are typically associated with crohn's disease which affects the small intestine where most nutrients are absorbed. because ulcerative colitis affects the large intestine it can cause severe and sometimes bloody diarrhea putting patients at risk for iron deficiency and anemia. you can measure your iron level with a simple blood test. ulcerative colitis can also deplete stores of folate. that's especially dangerous for women of child-bearing age since folate deficiency is linked to birth defects. fluid loss from diarrhea can also cause electrolyte imbalances.
inflammation of the colon causes the muscle layers to go into intermittent spasm and cause cramp-like pain which is pain that comes and goes. the pain usually is in the lower abdomen. since the muscles fail to contract in a normal pattern and the colonic contents move through the colon rapidly there is little opportunity for water to be reabsorbed. this leads to watery diarrhea. if the lining of the colon is inflamed and breaks down bleeding may occur. with colitis particularly colitis involving the distal colon (rectum and sigmoid colon) the pain often crescendos and precedes a diarrheal bowel movement. after the bowel movement the pain may relent but then returns with the next episode. depending upon the cause of the colitis fever and possibly malaise may be present.

one of the first things to do is throw away those q-tips and never use them again. one possible cause of bleeding after a q-tip use would be a ruptured eardrum or an abrasion/scratch in the sensitive ear canal area. pimples can also form in the ear canal. it would take a hands-on otoscopic examination by a medical provider to know the exact source and how to treat it. since your original feeling was that there was something inside your ear canal this would be another reason to be examined. a traumatic rupture of the eardrum should this be the cause can take several weeks to heal (depending on the size of the rupture). ear canal abrasions heal quicker but can become infected. ear pain would be one clinical sign of an infection that you should look for.
no not if you urinated between the time you masturbated and when you had sex. sperm will die as soon as it dries but you want to make sure your pre-cum isn't carrying any live sperm. if you urinate though usually that flushes the urethra. still you are playing with fire and asking for trouble. at the very least invest in some condoms.

screening tests are those that are done at regular intervals to detect a disease such as prostate cancer at an early stage. if the result of a screening test is normal the disease is presumed not to be present. if a screening test is abnormal the disease is then suspected to be present and further tests usually are needed to confirm the suspicion (that is to make the diagnosis definitively). prostate cancer usually is suspected initially because of an abnormality of one or both of the two screening tests that are used to detect prostate cancer. these screening tests are a digital rectal examination and a blood test called the prostate specific antigen (psa). in the digital rectal examination the doctor feels (palpates) the prostate gland with his gloved index finger in the rectum to detect abnormalities of the gland. thus a lump irregularity or hardness felt on the surface of the gland is a finding that is suspicious for prostate cancer. accordingly doctors usually recommend doing a digital rectal examination in men age  and over. the psa test is a simple reproducible and relatively accurate blood test. it is used to detect a protein (the prostate specific antigen) that is released from the prostate gland into the blood. the psa level is usually higher than /ml in people with prostate cancer than in people without the cancer. situations of large prostate size infection and inflammation are other reasons why the psa may be elevated. the psa therefore is valuable as a screening test for prostate cancer. accordingly doctors usually recommend doing a psa in men age  and over. subsequent screening is recommended based on individual preference and assessment of risk for developing prostate cancer. for example patients with a high risk of developing prostate cancer due to a family history or a high initial psa should have more frequent evaluation (usually annually). although still considered controversial most urologists recommend regular screening for prostate cancer in men who are likely to live for more than  years. the american urological association (aua) issued their latest guidelines for prostate cancer in . according to these men at the age of  should be offered a baseline psa test and a prostate exam (digital rectal exam or dre) to ascertain the risk of prostate cancer. subsequent screening and tests may be performed according to the findings on this initial evaluation and an individual's risk of getting the disease on the basis of other factors such as race ethnicity and family history of prostate cancer. as mentioned most urologists currently would advise some form of screening in men with a life expectancy greater than  years. most frequently it would be performed on an annual basis. although there is no definite cutoff age to stop prostate cancer screening most physicians would rarely screen men more than  years of age for this disease. results of the psa test under  nanograms per milliliter of blood are generally considered normal. there is a recent trend however to perform prostate biopsy in all patients with a psa more than .  ng/ml in order to detect prostate cancer at an earlier (and hopefully completely curable) stage. the american urological association guidelines () do not define a definite cutoff point but advise that all the other risk factors for prostate cancer should be taken into account while making a decision on whether to proceed for a biopsy. one of the important factors that needs to be considered is the rate at which the psa value has increased over time on repeated measurements (psa velocity). results between  and  are considered borderline. these borderline values are interpreted in the context of the patient's age symptoms signs family history and changes in the psa levels over time. results higher than  are considered abnormal suggesting the possibility of prostate cancer. it has been shown that the higher the psa value the more likely the diagnosis of prostate cancer. moreover the level of psa tends to increase when the cancer has progressed from organ-confined prostate cancer to local spread to distant (metastatic) spread. very high values such as  or  and over are usually caused by prostate cancer.

baby : your baby measures about .  inches from crown to rump and weighs almost  pounds now. its hearing is fully developed. as the fetus reacts to sounds its pulse increases. your baby will even move in rhythm to music. lungs are still growing but are not yet mature. patterns of your baby's brain waves appear like a full-term newborn. it also has patterns of sleeping and waking. mom-to-be : the baby's constant movements should be reassuring. you'll be putting on weight at the rate of about  pound per week now. you may be feeling some rib pain as your baby grows and pushes upward on your rib cage. the pressure may also be causing indigestion and heartburn. you may even be feeling stitch-like pains down the sides of your abdomen as your uterine muscle stretches. tip of the week : if you're planning to return to work you might want to begin checking out the availability of child care in your area. nannies cost about $ to $ per week. group day care typically ranges from $ to $ per week and home day care runs from about $ to $ per week. but keep in mind that you might change your mind after your baby arrives.

yes you should see a doctor.
"hepatitis c is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis c virus. technically since hepatitis c is an infectious disease one might think that an infectious disease specialist (a subspecialty of internal medicine) would be the appropriate medical specialist to see. hepatitis c is more than a simple infection however. it usually is a chronic infection that often is associated with important damage to the liver. because of this fact patients with hepatitis c are most commonly referred for treatment to a specialist in gastroenterology (also a subspecialty of internal medicine). gastroenterologists specialize in diseases of all of the gastrointestinal organs including the liver. moreover there are gastroenterologists who specialize in diseases of the liver including hepatitis c. these specialists are called hepatologists. (""hepar"" means liver. ) whether patients with hepatitis c are treated by gastroenterologists or hepatologists depends on the expertise (gastroenterology or hepatology) available in the community the severity of any associated liver disease and the complexity of the contemplated treatment."
"usually it is not difficult to diagnose gallstones. problems arise however because of the high prevalence of silent gallstones and the occasional gallstone that is difficult to diagnose. if a patient has symptoms that are typical for gallstones for example biliary colic cholecystitis or pancreatitis and has gallstones on ultrasonography little else usually can or needs to be done to demonstrate that the gallstones are causing the episode unless the patient has complicating medical issues. if episodes are not typical for gallstones however any gallstones found may be silent. these silent gallstones may be innocent bystanders and most importantly removing the gallbladder surgically will not treat the acute problem or prevent further episodes. in addition the real cause of the problem will not be pursued. in such a situation there is a need to have further evidence other than their mere presence that the gallstones are causing the episode. such evidence can be obtained during an episode or shortly thereafter. if ultrasonography can be done during an episode of pain or inflammation caused by gallstones it may be possible to demonstrate an enlarged gallbladder or bile duct caused by obstruction of the ducts by the gallstone. this is likely to require ultrasonography again after the episode has resolved in order to demonstrate that the gallbladder indeed was larger during the episode than before or after the episode. it is easier to obtain the necessary ultrasonography if the episode lasts several hours but it is much more difficult to obtain ultrasonography rapidly enough if the episode lasts only  minutes. another approach is to test the blood for abnormal liver and pancreatic enzymes. the advantage here is that the enzymes though not always elevated can be elevated during and for several hours after an episode of gallstone-related pain or inflammation so they might be abnormal even after the episode has subsided. it is important to remember however that the enzymes are not specific for gallstones and it is necessary to exclude other liver and pancreatic causes for abnormal enzymes. sometimes episodes of pain or inflammation may be more or less typical of gallstones but transabdominal ultrasonography may not demonstrate either gallstones or another cause of the episodes. in this case it is necessary to decide whether suspicion is high or low for gallstones as a cause of the episodes. if suspicion is low because of less-typical symptoms it may be reasonable only to repeat the ultrasonography obtain an ocg and/or test for abnormalities of liver or pancreatic enzymes. if suspicion is high because of more typical symptoms it is reasonable to go even further with endoscopic ultrasonography ercp and duodenal drainage. prior to these ""invasive"" procedures some physicians recommend mrcp; however the exact role of mrcp is not yet clear."
yes it is ok to take adderall with celexa together. both adderall and celexa increase your levels of serotonin a chemical in your brain that affects your mood. taking them together can increase these levels too much and your doctor should be monitoring you for severe changes in your mood heart rate and blood pressure. if monitored properly you should be fine.
some common drugs used to treat infertility in women include: clomiphene citrate (clomid): this drug causes ovulation by acting on the pituitary gland. it is often used in women who have polycystic ovarian syndrome (pcos) or other problems with ovulation. this medicine is taken by mouth. human menopausal gonadotropin or hmg (repronex pergonal): this medicine is often used for women who don't ovulate due to problems with their pituitary gland. it is an injected medicine. follicle-stimulating hormone or fsh (gonal-f follistim): fsh causes the ovaries to begin the process of ovulation. these drugs are usually injected. gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gn-rh) analog: these drugs are often used for women who don't ovulate regularly each month. these drugs are usually injected or given with a nasal spray. metformin (glucophage): doctors use this drug for women who have insulin resistance and/or pcos. this drug is usually taken by mouth. bromocriptine (parlodel): this drug is used for women with ovulation problems due to high levels of prolactin. prolactin is a hormone that causes milk production. many fertility drugs increase a woman's chance of having twins triplets or other multiples. women who are pregnant with multiple fetuses have more problems during pregnancy. multiple fetuses have a high risk of being born too early (prematurely). premature babies are at a higher risk of health and developmental problems.

"the short answer to your question is: no. currently there is no cure for tinnitus unless it's caused by a curable underlying condition (such as taking too much aspirin). tinnitus (or ""ringing in the ears"") can be more than annoying. it can become a debilitating problem in which the ""noise in the ears"" can drown out other sounds including a loved one's talking. if you believe you have tinnitus start with a visit to your primary care provider for an evaluation. you may be referred to a hearing specialist. while medication are available to treat tinnitus many people rely on masking devices that sort of ""counteract"" the interior noise of tinnitus. there's also a new hearing aid available that both amplifies sound and masks the tinnitus noise. wishing you well!"

"most helpful answer this is a great question and one you should ask your health care provider. it's a bit too involved to go into here but i'll briefly outline some (not all) of the options. and luckily webmd offers this handy comparison of some common blood pressure medications. a water pill or diuretic (such as hydrochlorothiazide or furosemide) lowers blood pressure by getting rid of excess water in your system. this essentially lowers your overall blood volume. if you have tinnitus (or ringing in the ears) you should talk to your health care provider about using a ""potassium-sparing"" water pill because the other type can make tinnitus worse. ace (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors have become a popular choice. these medications basically cause your blood vessels to relax which lowers your blood pressure. these medications usually have few side effects. beta blockers work by slowing down the pace of your heartbeat and also reducing the force at which the heart contracts. this combination causes your blood pressure to come down. if your doctor suggests a beta blocker be sure to get specific dosing instructions. some beta blockers shouldn't be taken when your pulse rate is low. again you ask a good question for your doctor. if you go on a blood pressure medication be sure to know what it does (specifically) why it's a good choice for you and what possible side effects you should watch out for. hope this helps!"

"""it depends on the doctor's relationship with the insurance company "" says richard e. ungar a los angeles-based health-care attorney. that relationship can make the difference between balance billing (not allowed) and billing you for a balance you owe (completely kosher). is your doc in or out? a health-care provider who is in-network with your insurance company has negotiated a price for his or her medical services and signed a contract with your insurer agreeing to those rates as payment in-full. with the exception of your co-pay deductible or coinsurance in-network providers generally cannot charge you more for their services. doing so is considered balance billing whether or not you've signed a form stating you'll pay the balance of what your insurer won't. but that's not the end of the story. there are scenarios in which you may be required to pay beyond what your insurance company will even if the doctor is in your carrier's network. duped by details there are details consumers commonly overlook about the rules of their insurance coverage that cause trouble says marty rosen executive vice president and co-founder of health advocate a healthcare advocacy and assistance organization. forgetting the common requirement to pre-certify services before receiving care is a frequent mistake. another is not confirming ahead of time whether you're being treated by doctors in your insurance carrier's network. ""failure to do so may result in denial of coverage by your insurance company and thus large out-of-pocket fees "" rosen says. also watch for certain elements of a doctor's visit that your insurance coverage may not cover ungar warns. for example let's say you see an in-network doctor for a routine colonoscopy. both the doctor visit and the procedure may be fully covered by your insurer. but if your doctor decides to use a newer sedative that requires an anesthesiologist to administer it (as opposed to doing it herself) unger says you could be on the hook for the anesthesiologist's charges. in order to avoid unnecessary health care costs before you get care: * make sure the service you need is covered. * determine exactly what the contracted service includes. * confirm that the doctor is in your network. and don't sign any documents you don't understand or don't feel comfortable with."
yes surgical treatment is necessary if medical treatment fails which should include - weeks of antibiotics nasal steroids and nasal saline irrigations.
when it comes to an insurer's decision to pay for any procedure the main issue is always whether it's considered medically necessary. while breast augmentation for the sake of vanity is not a covered service generally if a procedure is necessary to repair or preserve the healthy functioning of the body it's likely to be medically necessary. having said that the only way to know for certain is to ask your insurance carrier. rules vary from one plan to next. you'll likely need to get your health plan's authorization before having any surgery done. and you should work with your doctor to obtain medical records and other supporting materials that justify the procedure from a medical standpoint.
in most areas of the united states and canada fetal toxoplasmosis infection is rare. in the u. s. about  to  infants per   actually become infected before birth.  this is why screening for toxoplasmosis is not a part of routine prenatal care in this country. but getting tested for toxoplasmosis may be a good idea if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant and: you are worried that you might get toxoplasmosis. you think you may not be able to avoid exposure to the parasite. consider what higher-risk countries recommend as you make your decision about testing: in countries where toxoplasmosis risk is moderate all newborns are screened for toxoplasmosis infection. some states in the u. s. now screen all newborns for toxoplasmosis. in some countries where toxoplasmosis risk is high all pregnant women are screened for toxoplasmosis antibodies. a blood test is used to see whether you have the antibody to the toxoplasma parasite. if you have the antibody that means you have already been infected and your immune system now makes antibodies that can fight toxoplasma. these antibodies protect your fetus and newborn from infection. you may need more than one blood test to make sure the result is accurate. tests for toxoplasmosis toxoplasmosis blood test looks for the antibody to toxoplasma. if test results or symptoms show possible infection another test is done  to  weeks later to confirm the diagnosis. amniocentesis is used to collect amniotic fluid for testing. a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test is used on the fluid to check for signs of toxoplasma dna. this test can detect fetal toxoplasmosis. fetal ultrasound is used to check for signs of toxoplasmosis damage in the fetus. early detection birth defects are most likely to develop when a fetus is infected during weeks  through  of pregnancy.  this is why early detection and treatment of fetal toxoplasmosis is important for preventing severe fetal problems. (if an infection develops later in pregnancy severe fetal problems are less likely but treatment is important to prevent future problems. ) webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.
i have just spent the last  weeks in physical therapy. they always apply heat or have me get on a bike to heat up my muscles for  minutes before i go through any table massage work. next i do all my exercises then they end the session with  minutes of ice.
all these problems of periods are due to overweight. your expected weight is around  kg to  kg. it is easy to say just to reduce. but it is quite impossible to reduce so much. please put some effort to do it for at least  to  kg per month. it is a start. reduce all high calories diet and junk bakery food. but you should not fast. have regular exercise especially for the middle segment of the body like aerobics or brisk walk. all the fat in the body gets converted to hormones. you would have seen big men having breast as their fat is producing the female hormone. this hormone will affect the normal cycle of ovulation and you will not get the periods regularly. your fat distribution will be mainly around mid-segment such as thighs breast back and hip but not below knees and elbows. also there will be black discoloration behind the neck side of breast and inner aspect of thighs. kindly get a scan to check polycystic ovaries. in the meantime also check your empty stomach early morning thyroid profile and serum prolactin. these hormones can also affect your periods and can be corrected. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>
"you may have a condition called folliculitis -- an infection involving the hair follicles or perhaps even a resistant skin infection like mrsa. without a direct examination and a wound culture from of one of those ""zits"" you may not be able to get a definitive diagnosis and treatment. see your regular medical provider or a dermatologist. this problem can be solved but perhaps not just with soap and water."
"in addition to the depth of the burn the total area of the burn is significant. burns are measured as a percentage of total body area affected. the ""rule of nines"" is often used though this measurement is adjusted for infants and children. this calculation is based upon the fact that the surface area of the following parts of an adult body each correspond to approximately % of total (and the total body area of % is achieved): head = %. chest (front) = %. abdomen (front) = %. upper/mid/low back and buttocks = %. each arm = %. each palm = %. groin = %. each leg = % total (front = % back = %). as an example if both legs (% x  = %) the groin (%) and the front chest and abdomen were burned this would involve % of the body. only second and third degree burn areas are added together to measure total body burn area. while first degree burns are painful the skin integrity is intact and it is able to do its job with fluid and temperature maintenance. if more %-% of the body is involved in a burn significant fluid may be lost. shock may occur if inadequate fluid is not provided intravenously. as the percentage of burn surface area increases the risk of death increases as well. patients with burns involving less than % of their body should do well but those with burns involving greater than % have a significant mortality risk depending upon a variety of factors including underlying medical conditions and age."
"prenatal vitamins are fine to take even if you are not pregnant (or wanting to be). vitamins are not a substitute for good nutrition and regular exercise so please do this as well. you didn't mention the name of the ""stomach med"" you were taking so i don't know how to advise you for that part of your question but if you are not going to attempt to conceive until next year you can problem keep taking the stomach medication until that time. ask your doctor for specific advice."
a baby's normal temperature can range from about  up to . . most doctors say a rectal temperature over .  is considered a fever.

hi this indicates passing of renal stones. get a usg abdomen done to confirm whether the calculus has drained out or not. drinking plenty of water will be helpful. thanks
"the short answer to your question is ""yes. "" but that's not the end of the story. a  study published in the american journal of health system pharmacy noted that several categories of medications were linked to various types of false-positive urine drug screen tests (including screens for methadone). among the specific medications that caused false-positives were antihistamines including diphenhydramine (better known as benadryl) and doxylamine -- both of which are ingredients in many over-the-counter cough-and-cold remedies. however these antihistamines were not specifically linked to false-positives for methadone in the study. it's worth noting that employers and others who perform routine drug screenings aren't required to give you a do-over. they can choose to accept the initial test results at face value. i wish you all the best with this."
hi this below is from nuvaring. nuvaring is used in a -week cycle. keep nuvaring in your vagina for  weeks ( days) and then remove it for a  week ( day) break. the ring should be inserted and removed on the same day of the week and at the same time. (for example if you insert your nuvaring on a monday at : a. m. you should remove it on the monday  weeks later at : a. m. ) you will usually get your period during the -week break that you remove nuvaring. insert a new nuvaring after the -week break. the new ring should be inserted on the same day of the week and at the same time that you inserted it the last month even if your period has not stopped. or like some women do is to keep just replacing the ring to get no periods if so then you will never no where you are then perhaps you should start again as above. hope this helps your problem. good luck
my opinion is that the pain may be due to pcos. a possibility of renal calculus should be kept in mind. ultrasound abdomen will help differentiate between the two.

many men face some dribbling at different levels after prostate surgery. using condoms can be helpful for two reasons. it may help prolong erections as well as catch any unwanted leakage. some men find doing the kegal exercises helpful. these are the muscles you use to stop your stream during urination. squeeze and hold these muscles ten times to make a set. perform one set three times a day at least  times a week. this may help reduce some of the leakage. it will take several weeks to strengthen these muscles. if your symptoms do not improve or you are not satisfied using the condoms there are some alternatives that an urologist may be able to offer.
"i learned this trick from a woman i used to work with who at the time just had her  child. she said the secret is wearing a girdle for at least - weeks. your muscles - and everything else that had to get pushed out smashed and repositioned to make room for your little blessing -have all essentially been displaced stretched beyond their limit. you have to ""retrain"" your stomach muscles to hold everything in place - back to their original position and not bulging out making you appear pregnant. i know this works because my sister and her own daughter did not use this trick - both still look pregnant to this day. it worked for me for both of my pregnancies i was back to my original weight and shape. i hope it works for you as well."
parents are relegated to determine if a child has a possible ear infection based solely on symptoms and signs . those of us in the clinical trenches know that symptoms and signs are not necessarily predictive of a definitive diagnosis. a recent two-year study in finland looked at  children ages - months and tested the predictive value of common middle ear infection symptoms: ear-rubbing or pulling irritability less playful excessive crying poor appetite restless sleep runny nose congestion vomiting diarrhea and fever. the diagnosis of a middle ear infection (otitis media) requires a certain diagnostic criteria: middle ear fluid detected by pneumatic otoscopy — this is the little bulb syringe attached to the otoscope that puffs air against the eardrum to check for mobility (the normal in and out movement of the eardrum). abnormal color opacity bulging (shape) of the eardrum. middle ear infections are typically bulging and have a distinct red or yellow color instead of shiny white. in this study not one but three different physicians systematically examined the ears of children strongly suspected by the parents as having a middle ear infection based on symptoms alone. the results: the duration and severity of the symptoms were not predictive of a middle ear infection. ear-rubbing and pulling long thought to be predictive of ear pain was proven to be an invalid sign. it was actually more common in children who did not have a middle ear infection. fever was also not a predictive sign. a prior cold was not a predictive sign in this study although statistically most children who get middle ear infection usually do have a cold. conjunctivitis (pink eye) may be a presumptive sign in some not all cases. the only definitive way to diagnose a child with a middle ear infection is by a careful systematic medical examination by an experienced clinician using a pneumatic otoscope. i see these false alarms nearly every day in my clinical practice. parents believe their children have an ear infection when in reality they do not. many parents will still demand antibiotics just in case  or come up with some compelling stories like going out of town tomorrow a seriously ill grandparent or upcoming air travel in an effort to plead their case. cursory or incomplete examinations by hurried clinicians tend to over-read ear examination findings resulting in inaccurate diagnoses. i find this quite often in emergency room or urgent care visits. here are  facts about ear infection: . not all middle ear infections in children (not including babies under the age of three months) require antibiotics. as a matter of fact over  percent of middle ear infections will self-resolve in a few days on their own without any medical intervention. shocking. it is perfectly fine to wait a few days to see if the bodys immune system orchestrates the cure. . middle ear infections hurt. regardless of the presence of fever (harmless) a child in pain should be treated with acetaminophen (tylenol) or ibuprofen (advil motrin) at an appropriate dose for the pain not the fever. . fever is harmless and does not need to be treated in most cases. . middle ear infections are not emergencies. they really have no place in the emergency room. . not all recurrent ear infection will result in children getting tubes. however if middle ear fluid is present for more than three months and/or children are having hearing loss an ent specialist should be consulted. . children in daycare get more ear infections. the fall and winter months have the highest incidence. . children exposed to any secondary cigarette smoke get more ear infections. (if you smoke around your children you should be arrested. ) . children who are breast-fed for at least six months get less ear infections that bottle-fed babies. . children who have a nighttime bottle in the crib or depend on a pacifier tend to have more ear infections. . children do grow out of ear infections. we see a marked reduction after age six so hang in there. now go buy a home otoscope and start practicing.
hi yes you both need to be treated at the same time other wise it will just keep going back and froth between you. if its just happened don't worry chlamydia hides deep in tissues and could have been a long time ago and you would not even known you had it its a bit of a bugger for doing that. hope this helps you. good luck
there are sites on the net that will give you answers depending on usage duration etc. from what i've read in the past  days from the last use.
i think you mean undescended testicles (ones that are not in the scrotum where they belong but rather in the abdomen). at age four bringing them down now is advisable. it would be highly highly unlikely that future fertility would be adversely impacted since you are doing surgery at this age. i think you will end up with plenty of grandchildren.
the symptoms of prostate enlargement really are manifest by two different factors. one is the actual size. as the gland gets bigger its harder to push the urine through. the other cause for symptoms for men with signs of prostate enlargement isnt really the size of the gland but the fact that the gland and surrounding tissues are involved with smooth muscle. its part of the normal architecture that those muscles squeeze down. so as they squeeze the urethra they block the flow as well and thats another whole category of medications called alpha blockers that relax those muscles. the advantage to the alpha blockers is that they work very quickly men have remarkable improvement in their urinating symptoms almost within days and often avoid the need for any surgical intervention. the problem with the alpha blockers is they might not last as long so maybe after a year or two or three the symptoms might start to come back. thats where the  alpha-reductase inhibitors come into play the avodart and the proscar and that they actually shrink the gland. and sometimes the combination of the two is what has the most success for some men. sl: what are the side effects? the avodart and the proscar have a very low incidence of side effects that are sexual. the main ones are sometimes an increase in sex drive sometimes a decrease in sexual ability and for many men a decrease in volume of ejaculate because youre shrinking the glandular structure. for the alpha blockers their main side effect is that they relax the smooth muscle so depending on whether youre using a new one or an old one some men can have problems with blood pressure and also retrograde ejaculation where because the bladder neck is relaxed when the man ejaculates the semen goes backwards into the bladder. sl: that doesnt sound very good. its retrograde ejaculation is generally its painless. men though become very obsessed with how things should be and when theres changes such as reduced volume they become upset with that and want to restore it.
heartburn is a burning discomfort that is generally felt in the chest just behind the breastbone. the burning sensation results when harsh stomach juices come in contact with and irritate the delicate lining of the esophagus. it is also known as acid indigestion.
currently there are no drug interactions found between synthroid and prevacid. however this does not mean that interactions cannot exist. it is important to work with your pharmacist to see if there is any new information regarding these two products. prevacid should be taken  minutes prior to a meal. synthroid should be taken  minutes to one hour prior to a meal. they can be taken together with water on an empty stomach.
"true ""traveler's diarrhea"" is a bacterial infection often due to enteric e. coli but parasites and viruses can cause diarrhea too (heard about those cruise ships? ). i don't think this had anything to do with your nexium. the advice that you can ""eat anything"" was not intended to say that nexium prevents food-borne pathogen infections."
white spots can be caused by the presence of fluoride in the water known as dental fluorosis. white spots are not necessarily a bad thing. white spots can also be caused by a child having a high fever while their teeth are still developing. if the spots are a cosmetic concern they can be removed. be sure to also have the spots checked to make sure they aren't cavities that are forming.
strep cannot be accurately diagnosed by the severity of the sore throat — it requires both a hands-on medical examination and a lab test for confirmation. medical providers who feel they can just look in the throat and accurately diagnose strep tend to be wrong half of the time; not much better than a coin toss. there are some suspicious signs of strep that one can notice by simply looking at the throat. many people get all excited when they see white stuff on the tonsils. this is not a definite sign of strep and can even be food particles. strep tends to cause petechiae — tiny irregularly-shaped red dots appearing on the back of the palate and on or near the uvula. the back of the throat and palate area is usually an angry-looking fire-engine red. the kids look and act sick. their breath smells like they have never used a toothbrush in their life. for those clinicians who have spent their careers insulted by this strep smell we usually have a pretty good idea that this child probably has strep. i still test them. if the rapid strep test is surprisingly negative (it is not %) i tend to get a throat culture. a culture takes two days but the accuracy approaches  percent. streptococcal infections have a bad historical reputation since it has the potential to cause heart-damaging rheumatic fever kidney disease life-threatening pneumonia and other serious complications. the reason why we treat strep when we diagnosis is to prevent these complications that are relatively rare now. if you have a good immune system our bodies can easily overcome an occasional attack of strep. kids who are excluded from school with strep should have at least  hours of treatment and show improvement before returning to school. treatment with antibiotics usually a penicillin-based one if you are not allergic to them will last about  days. there is really no need to keep children home that long. i always recommend that they change their toothbrush after a day of treatment since strep can colonize on wet toothbrushes. if you have several kids who keep their toothbrushes in the same drawer touching it is the same as sharing toothbrushes. for the teenagers i warn them about taking a clandestine swig out of the milk or orange juice container in the refrigerator when no one is watching. if a sore throat persists more than a week or so accompanied by fatigue a mono test should be considered.
there is a moderate interaction with one of the components found in janumet (metformin/sitagliptin) and zantac (ranitidine). ranitidine is a cationic drug and theoretically could decrease the excretion of metformin. this drug interaction has been observed when using another cationic medication cimetidine. because of this we use caution with similar medications. these interactions can increase the risk of lactic acidosis which included symptoms of malaise myalgia respiratory distress hyperventilation slow or irregular heartbeat somnolence abdominal upset or other unusual symptoms. lactic acidosis is a possible side effect from the metformin. consult your health-care professional if both of these medications are being prescribed together. monitor your reactions for side effects of lactic acidosis and stop medication right away if the symptoms occur.
"good news! here is an article on nail problems and injuries that contains the following statement along with a lot of other great information: "" separation from the nail bed. once your nail separates from its nail bed for whatever reason it will not reattach. nails grow back slowly. it takes about  months for fingernails and up to  months for toenails to grow back attached to the nail bed. "" the webmd answers staff usually but you had quite a crush injury. the body has a remarkable ability to re-grow a lost or damaged nail assuming the matrix (the base of the nail that has the cells needed to regenerate the nail) has not been damaged. a damaged matrix may cause the nail to grow back somewhat deformed or have a ridge. when we lose a finger we do not grow a new one but when we lose a nail the body likes to replace it. time will tell if your nail re-grows again and comes in normally. my son just had the same accident. so i'm curious since its been a little over a year. has your sons nail grown back?"

it should be given a chance to dry while keeping it clean and using antiseptic spray until it heals.
absolutely. it's better to be honest than not especially if it's medications that he doesn't know that you took and if they're medications that he doesn't think that you need prescribe for yourself. this is very common today with people sharing their medications. once again that's why we have doctors and healthcare providers and pharmacists. we study these subjects we study conditions how drugs work drugs are safe when used correctly. but if you're going to actually take a medication that wasn't intended for you there is a good chance you could end up in the emergency room. you don't know what is being treated – what you are being treated for -- you don't know if you're going to have an allergic reaction to it. you might think well it's just -- i have some flu so i'm going to take my friend's water pill. well your blood pressure could drop so low that you can actually pass out and hit your head and it could have been because of that. so it's really important that people don't share their medications. be honest with your physician and say look this is what happened promise that you'll never do it again. and keep a medication list of all your medicines that you should be taking along with your vitamin and otcs and just be honest.

if you are breastfeeding your baby the breast lump that you describe could suggest possibility of presence of cyst infected lobule breast abscess galactocele fibroadenoma lipomas fibrocystic disease mastitis etc. most breast lumps that develop during pregnancy and lactation are benign but occasionally women do develop breast cancer. any lump that develops should be taken seriously whether the woman is pregnant or not. the exact cause can only be made out after careful examination and further evaluation. visit your doctor/gynecologist at the earliest for thorough examination and further evaluation to look for the underlying cause. mammogram or ultrasound scan and tumor marker tests done will help to rule out/predict chances of cancer. you can try with warm compresses use of heating pad gentle massage etc to alleviate the pain. nurse your baby frequently and vary the positions to allow for pressure on different ducts (to help with complete emptying of the ducts). make sure your bra is giving you good support. take care.

i suggest you get this checked out by a medical professional. many conditions can cause the symptoms you describe but one that comes to mind is a staph infection. obviously if that's the case you want to get treatment as soon as possible. itching is not normally a sign of staph infection but it still would be good to rule this out. at any rate you're having abnormal symptoms that are worth getting checked. meanwhile be sure to wash your hands thoroughly and often. in the event you have some sort of communicable infection you want to take every precaution not to transmit it to someone else. i wish you all the best! i had the same symptoms. it started on my hand and went to my feet. after going to various doctors i was diagnosed with a rare fungal infection that can be transferred from dogs to humans in rare cases. i can't find anything about it on webmd or from any of my current drs. i've started to call / ask vets since after my diagnosis the local vet diagnosed the family dog with the skin infection. the tx for mas was a high dose of ingested lamisil  form) which can be bad for your liver as well.
in all cases the implant should be removed as there is no need for it and u r subjected to its complications.
hi so have you seen a gyno yet and take a sample of your urine with you from when you having your period also best if you can arrange an appointment for the same time if need be do a sample then. its about the best advice. good luck
you can hold on to cobra until it expires at which point the loss of insurance will be a qualifying event that allows you to buy another policy even if it's outside the open enrollment period. but you'd be well served to search your state's marketplace this fall for another plan that starts january  . it's quite possible you'll find a less expensive insurance policy especially if you qualify for a subsidy. if you find a better plan you can drop cobra at the start of the year when your new plan kicks into place. if you then get a job that offers coverage you'll drop your marketplace coverage and be covered by your new employer.
i had pigment gallstones which took about  years to be correctly diagnosed. after my gall bladder was removed i occasionally had the same pain and so i had an e. r. c. p which was clear. when the specialist told me it was clear he then asked me if i ever took padenine to which i said yes. he then asked if i had taken panadenine before my last attack to which i again answered yes. he then gave me some interesting news telling me that some people have a reaction to codeine which causes biliary colic and i should try staying away from codeine. that was  years ago and i have not had that pain again in all those years. i thank my lucky stars for meeting that wonderful doctor. i hope this may help some of you as it seems this problem is not so well known.
bee-keeping hoods do not really touch the eyes and they appear to be well-ventilated so i would assume that it would not be very likely for the suit to be a major factor in transmitting microorganisms. most of the time an object of clothing may be blamed but in reality it was most likely unwashed contaminated hands that were the vector for pink eyes. you could try and disinfect the hoods between kids if that is possible or even logistically feasible.
there are problems with the fat burning option on the cardio machines and it really ought to be eliminated. the idea behind the fat-burning option is this: because fat is denser than carbohydrate it requires more oxygen to burn. so to maximize the percentage of fat you burn compared to carbohydrate the fat-burning mode would have you work out at a pace at which your body can deliver lots of oxygen to your muscles. that generally means a slow pace to keep you from getting breathless. the problem is that when you exercise at a slower speed you burn fewer total calories -- from both carbohydrate and fat -- because you simply don't do as much work. further the way to get aerobically fit is to get your heart rate into the training range (usually % to % of your maximum heart rate) which is hard to do at slower speeds. and fitness is ultimately what you're after whether your goals are better health burning calories or improving heart and lung capacity. the bottom line is that the fat-burning mode probably won't be intense enough to maximize total calorie- or fat-burning or to help you increase or maintain optimum fitness levels. use the cardio mode to maximize your exercise benefits.
you can see a rebound weight gain with any of the stimulants but it really happens for a short time and doesn't usually continue indefinitely. on the other hand we have seen compulsive binge eating in those with untreated adhd. eating disorders are common in adhd and are the result of untreated symptoms of impulsivity and distractibility. stimulants not only decrease appetite but also decrease the urge to binge in these cases.
ovaries do not grow back so i suspect it was never removed. only the cyst.
this really depends on what type of infection and how severe it is. typically if you have a small cut you can wash with soap and water and then apply a triple antibiotic ointment. if the infection on the skin appears red warm to the touch painful or oozing you will need to see your health care provider. skin infections can be very difficult to treat and can require prescription antibiotics if not taken seriously.
no this would not be likely. pregnancy tests check for hcg a hormone that is chemically different than the valium.
it is either of these possibilities. h. pylori gastritis celiac or crohns disease. i recommend seeing another dr. and get another gi endoscopy done.
corticosteroid injections commonly are given to relieve pain in the joints such as the elbow or the neck. the medication works by reducing inflammation which in turn can relieve pressure on a nerve and reduce pain. a corticosteroid shot for joint or soft tissue pain should not cause any side effect like indigestion. generally speaking the medication stays in the local area of the injection and does not travel throughout the body. corticosteroids also can be administered by injection into a vein. this type of injection is used to treat an allergic reaction or asthma. while it's unlikely this type of steroid injection would cause indigestion it's not impossible. if you received a cortisone shot for joint pain then your heartburn likely is not related. hope this helps!
i really don't see any harm in it. it's not a drug that you really have to wean off of. you should be fine to stop cold turkey.
baby : your baby measures about  inches from head to toe and weighs about  pounds. baby is growing plumper and beginning to control its own body temperature. eyebrows and eyelashes are fully developed and hair on the head is getting thicker. head and body are now proportioned like a newborn's. hands are now fully formed and fingernails are growing. mom-to-be : your uterus is about four inches above your navel and it's hard to believe you still have about  weeks to go as baby continues to push on your ribs. you may be feeling more discomfort in your pelvis and abdomen. you'll probably be gaining about a pound a week. tip of the week : the membranes around the baby that contain the amniotic fluid are called the bag of waters. they usually do not break until just before the onset of labor but if it does break prematurely your risk of infection increases so call your practitioner immediately.
this is a great question. but of course as a pharmacist i have to ask the patient a few questions too because we need to find out what is the root cause. could this be more of a virus running around and causing that nausea and vomiting because in that case it's really just flat coca-cola syrup over some ice and just letting it pass. if it becomes very violent though and they haven't been able to keep any food or water down you have to go in the emergency room because dehydration could cause more problems down the road. so you want to be really careful about that. if you are pregnant once again you can't really take the over-the-counter products that are available such as meclizine basically known as dramamine or also bonine. bonine is a chewable form of the product. these are not safe in pregnant women so therefore they have to go more the natural route. they could possibly try; there is a wristband that they could wear around their wrist to help prevent that as well. but if it's just for motion sickness because it was on a boat; which is very common for people or a train. the products that are available; dramamine and bonine are quite effective. they may cause a little bit of tiredness because they are actually antihistamines and by causing the drowsiness they are actually calming down the center in your brain that causes the nausea and vomiting. but once again as a pharmacist i am going to ask my patients a few questions first before i can help you find the right choice.
infertility does not cause physical symptoms. infertility is a general term for a couple's inability to get pregnant after  year of having sex  to  times a week without using birth control methods. for women younger than age  with unexplained fertility problems some doctors will diagnose infertility and offer treatment to a couple only after  years of their trying to become pregnant. for women over  some doctors will offer testing and treatment after  months of trying to become pregnant. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.
hydrochlorothiazide can make your skin extra sensitive to the sun which means you will burn more easily or get a rash from sun exposure. while it is ok to spend some time in the sun i recommend you apply a sunscreen of at least spf  before doing so to avoid a reaction.
no one could be shy of what god has created him it is gods will so you need to face everything without fear. be yourself and socialize. you need to see a psychiatrist for some counseling sessions.
"personally i think those ""testosterone boosters"" are worthless but you have to make your own decision. herbal and over-the-counter non-drug therapies do not have to prove effacacy in the same way of prescription drugs."
that's the cost if you use enough services to meet your full deductible. you also need to factor in any other out-of-pocket costs. under the law insurers must cap you total spending at $  per year but that amount does not include your premium which is the amount you pay each month for your health plan.
hi. in my opinion if the mri and xray did not show any abnormality so no need to worry i recommend a uric acid and esr tests also. if you are overweight. lose some. that may also be due to mechanical problem secondary to hyperextension of knee joint. feel better soon
more like a mole or wart trying to start maybe stress related also
no. hair coloring will have no effect on puberty.
you may notice some hair loss but most often only in the treated area. if you do have hair loss it will usually occur suddenly and come out in clumps. in most cases the hair will grow back after therapy stops but it may be thinner or have a different texture. one way to minimize hair loss is to cut your hair short before treatment begins to make less weight on the hair shaft. if the hair loss occurs on top of your head be sure to wear a hat or a scarf to protect your scalp from the sun when you go outside. if you decide to purchase a wig ask the doctor to write a prescription for one and check to see if it's covered by your insurance or is a tax-deductible expense.
there are lot of medical issues which can occur from tattooing like hiv infection tetanus hepatitis b and c and allergic reactions. nowadays tattooists reduced such risks by following universal precautions working with single use items and sterilizing their equipment after each use. as you mentioned your piercing was done only till the epidermis the infection is highly unlikely (very very less chance) that you will contact any infection. even if the needle was infected it requires contact with body fluids like blood. so you can relax. still i would like to make the following points:- in case of an hiv infection the test takes about - months to be positive. hence there is no way to find out if you got infected which is again highly unlikely. there is something called post-exposure prophylaxis (pep) given to individuals who have been exposed to the virus and includes three drugs given only under doctor's supervision. you can discuss this with your doctor. if you frequently get a tattoo done make sure your tetanus and hepatitis b vaccines are up-to-date. always have clear knowledge about the infections spread by tattooing like hiv and hepatitis and their mode of spread. take care and stay safe. for further doubts consult a hiv aids specialist online --> <link>
success and failure are part of life but we should keep trying. when we are down only way is up. i know it is easier said than done but you have to keep trying and persistence is the only key to success. here are a few steps that can help you. do meditation daily for at least half an hour in the morning. follow a routine exercise regularly and take a balanced diet rich in antioxidants and omega fatty acids. you study in small shifts of half an hour followed by  minutes rest. also give at least one hour daily for your hobbies. share your feelings with family or close friends as sharing helps a lot. remember every problem has a solution you just need to try solving it and help is just a step away. for further information consult a psychiatrist online --> <link>
glucose meters are very accurate perhaps not as accurate as a laboratory test but certainly close enough less-expensive and convenient. if it is a new one (there are many different models) they have been well-tested for accuracy. if it is for you many insurance companies will pay for them including the test strips with a medical prescription.
even though you are above age  if you do not qualify for either medicare or medicaid you can apply for coverage in the exchange/marketplace. generally subsidies are only available to people between % and % of the federal poverty level but there is an exception for legal immigrants who do not qualify for medicaid because they have not been in the country for  years. so based on your income and legal residency status you should qualify for a premium subsidy to purchase a private policy on the exchange/marketplace.
of course you need to get it checked out. i am surprised that it took you a year to get to this point. there are many many causes of ear pain including many causes that do not involve the ear itself. it is going to take a thorough systemic diagnostic work-up to get to the bottom of this year-long issue.
i understand your concern. escitalopram may not help you to sleep since it does not have much sedative property. feliz plus has clonazepam in it which will aid in sleep but is not recommended long term. since you have not mentioned any other symptoms regarding the prescription of stalopam i am assuming that you do not have any other symptoms except sleep disturbance. for a beginning start practising sleep hygiene do a bit of exercise in the evening and avoid drinking coffee after  pm. if you are still unable to get sleep then i suggest you tablet ramelteon  mg known by brand name rametax which is very physiological and devoid of side effects. consult your specialist doctor discuss with him or her and take medicine with consent. but i will advise you to try the non-medical approach. if you have symptoms of anxiety or depression then it is better to continue stalopam. for further information consult a psychiatrist online --> <link>

it has been proven that cannabis use can lead to neurocognitive impairment. the damage may not be apparent immediately but as the brain develops the impairment would become obvious. equally important are the legal ramifications of cannabis use during pregnancy. in most states child protective services (cps) would be immediately notified of the presence of illicit drugs. findings could very well lead to the child becoming a ward of the court upon birth.

yes. motion sickness can be an inner ear disorder but the can be many different causes of vertigo.
yes vomiting is a side effect of the medication. it is important that you give your child this medication with some food or milk because it can be harsh on the stomach. if she continues to vomit after the second or third dose of the medication contact your doctor or health-care provider; it may be necessary to switch her to a different antibiotic.
hi i don't think so. as its just a black and white print.
not knowing anything about you your medical history state of health nutritional habits etc. it would be impossible for me to guess the reason(s) you may be losing hair but i can tell you that hair occurs in two stages: active growing and the resting stage. hair in the resting state tends to break off. like other mammals we tend to shed certain times of the year. see a dermatologist for a first-hand evaluation and a patient-specific answer.
hi those symptoms are not enough to diagnose ms lot of disorders ranging from lumbar disc lesion and general weakness to ms could result in these symptoms looking to history of optic neuritis and recently thinking disorder numbness weakness may be giving a possibility of ms in early stages but as i said not the only diagnosisso the development of further related symptoms or signs would be informative but this can not be confirmed or denied unless you do mri again and check for any changes i recommend being examined by a neurologist again and mriregards
water therapy (hydrotherapy or aqua therapy) is a program of exercises performed in a large pool. water therapy may be easier on painful joints from psoriatic arthritis because the water takes some of the weight off the affected areas. appropriate recreational exercise also may be beneficial but only if it is preceded by a program of range-of-motion strength and aerobic exercises to reduce the chance of injury. regardless of the exercise program you select it's important to choose one you enjoy so that you maintain it. before beginning any new exercise program discuss exercise options with your doctor. also begin new exercise programs under the supervision of a physical therapist or qualified professional preferably one who has experience working with psoriatic arthritis patients. furthermore it's important to know that improper exercise programs may worsen psoriatic arthritis. check with your doctor or therapist before starting an exercise program and adjust your program if you experience any of the following: unusual or persistent fatigue. increased weakness. decreased range of motion. increased joint swelling. continuing pain (lasting more than an hour after exercising).
"it is unlikely that telogen effluvium. the loss of hair that is in the ""resting stage"" would result in progressive loss of % of your scalp hair. have you seen a high-level dermatologist. one that is associated with a large university-based medical center. dear dr moser i have only been to my gp and gyno about this. both say they have 'no answer'. my thyroid and kidney function is 'normal'. i have not been referred to a dermatologist because neither dr think it is a dermatological 'issue' as the quality of my hair has not changed (still soft fine shinny silky) and my scalp appears healthy. i still believe there must be a cause for this sudden and dramatic hair loss. should i still pursue a second opinion?"
i would not be possible to determine a patient-specific reason for your lack of orgasm so i would strongly suggest that you make an appointment to see a urologist.
hi this seems to be a lymph node enlargement (pre and peri auricular). this may be secondary to a surrounding underlying infection. only paracetamol wont help. broad spectrum antibiotics will help. inner ear infection needs to be ruled out. thanks
calm down. you are getting a good treatment. you have a throat infection. keep on your antibiotic course till the end of course and continue if needed. get paracetamol  every  - if you have fever. try salt water gargling (warm). to soothe your pain. strepsils can also help you swallow better.
some plans are being cancelled because they don't comply with the new requirements of the law. but there are new plans available so they'll need to switch plans. they won't lose insurance coverage.

"you cannot be accurately diagnosed over the internet so you will need to see your medical provider for that all-important hands-on evaluation. when one mentions ""painful clusters of blisters"" the first consideration would be herpes simplex or herpes zoster (shingles). please get it checked out and properly treated."
these are vague and non-specific symptoms. unfortunately it would be impossible to blindly diagnose your friend based on such little information. this person should be seen by a medical provider so he/she can be properly examined diagnosed and treated -- three things that cannot be accomplished over the internet.

"liposuction is generally considered safe but people should understand there are now several different ""flavors"" of liposuction. these include traditional ""tumescent"" liposuction non-invasive cryoliposuction (cool lipo) and laser liposuction. the answer to your question depends a bit on what type of liposuction you had done. if you had traditional (tumescent) liposuction in which fluid was injected under your skin before the fat being sucked out with a metal wand called a cannula then pinkness around the cannula sites may not be unusual. if the pink spots are near the incision sites this also may simply be normal bruising. with traditional liposuction there is always some level of bruising to the treated areas afterwards. because you have questions about these pink patches i'd suggest you call the surgeon who performed your liposuction procedure to find out what's going on. he or she is in the best position to tell you if you're experiencing normal healing or if something else is going on. wishing you all the best! hello this is really a good question here we have some of the most common side effects of liposuction: scars swelling bruises pain reduced mobility just to make it clear side effects differ from complications in the fact that the side effects always take place after an invasive liposuction surgery while complication may never appear! as for the pink patches can you please tell me which liposuction technique did you opt for (tumescent ultrasonic laser etc) for more info on the side effects have a look here: <link>#side_effects"
"whether it is used by patients or doctors the word ""rash"" does not have an exact meaning or refer to a specific disease or kind of disorder. it's a general term that means an outbreak of bumps on the body that changes the way the skin looks and feels. rashes can be localized to one area or be widespread. the way people use this term a rash can refer to many different skin conditions. common categories of rash are: scaly patches of skin not caused by infection. scaly patches of skin produced by fungal or bacterial infection. red itchy bumps or patches all over the body. although rashes are seldom dangerous self-diagnosis is not usually a good idea. proper evaluation of a skin rash requires a visit to a doctor or other health care professional."
a few problems with your story. . fever is harmless; both the  and the . it is unlikely that an experienced physician would do anything. fever is more beneficial and does not need to be treated at all. . mono is a virus and it is not treatable either
"maybe. if the herpes virus was active at the time that virus may (not always) transmit to another person. based on what you have shared that ""peck"" on the lips is not very likely to transmit the virus to you. unfortunately only time will provide the definitive answer. if you end up getting a similar herpetic lesion on your lip then the answer will be obvious. there is really no need to stress out over this and there is nothing that you can do. exposure does not insure that you will get herpes simplex (the name for the lip lesion)."
what does your diet consist of? if it is high in processed sugar you are going to burn that quickly and become tired. if you eat more foods that have complex carbohydrates such as grains rather than simple carbohydrates such as sugar. also make sure you don't skip meals and always eat breakfast. that will make sure you have a constant energy supply. also rome wasn't built in a day. exercise if good for the body; remember you only have one body so make the best of it. start with light exercise and work your way up. you are going to feel tired at first because you are not use to it. but once it becomes a habit you should start feeling better.

it does sound to me that you very well may be suffering from hypothyroidism or at least a sluggish thyroid but it cannot be known for sure without more test results. what tests did your doctor run exactly? if he suspects it may by a thyroid issue he definitely should have ran a tsh free  and free  test at very least as well as some other tests that may will greatly improve the chances of diagnosing this correctly. without them it is hard to say because hypothyroidism can have overlapping symptoms with other disorders many of which can also be discovered through a comprehensive hormone test. i strongly recommend you getting one done if your doctor has not already.
there is a whole set of postoperative instructions for bleaching treatment. these include avoiding red colored drinks and foods for  days and avoiding coffee and tobacco. brushing and flossing are essential to keep up your oral health and your whitening result. in my office we give patients a post-op instruction sheet to follow. ask your dentist for one.

"get off the pills! i was taking ortho-tricycline for years  yrs old ended up in hospital with ""cardiac event"" got to choose a cardiologist chewed me out royally for taking birth control pills @ my age (and my gyno had recommended them to help me sail through menopause). little did i know they could have killed me. cause high blood pressure blood clots--i was a heart attack waiting to happen and dr. said i definitely was headed for a stroke! get the blood test to show if you are in menopause to know for sure. use condoms get a hysterectomy whatever but don't kill yourself! when young the pill is great; no place for the over  crowd."

this is a good question. most people associate botulinum toxin (one common brand is botox) with celebrities and cosmetic wrinkle reduction. however botulinum toxin serves real medical purposes too and one of them is pain relief. (here is an article about botulinum toxin injections to relieve lower back pain. ) botulinum toxin is a powerful muscle relaxant. in general it takes five to seven days for botulinum toxin to fully take effect. it's definitely not a product that takes effect instantly. since you only received your injections two days ago i'd advise you wait at least another week to allow the medication to work. you don't say what type of pain you got botox injections for. you need to know that botulinum toxin for pain relief doesn't work in all people. and in some people it only works after receiving several rounds of injections (usually about three months apart). hope this helps!
the tingling idk about. but the coldness in hands and feet can be normal. ? for years now my feet are always cold even if i have socks on. it cold.

it is normal to feel sick for a day or two when you have acute pharyngitis. the nausea could be caused by the antibiotic or just by being sick. try to eat something if you can -- anything. but if you can't keep water or liquids down you need to let your doctor know. you don't want to become dehydrated. also if you're not starting to feel better after a couple of days give your doctor a call. several of the symptoms you describe such as diarrhea chest pains and stomach pains are not symptoms of pharyngitis so that's something you need to discuss with your doctor to see if something else is going on.
i would definitely encourage you to contact your doctor. . finding blood in the stool can have many causes including infectious milk allergy/intolerance and intestinal bleeding.

pre-existing conditions will no longer prevent you from being sold a health plan. insurers are now prohibited from taking a person's health into consideration. you also cannot be charged more for your plan because of the state of your health. given your situation you may qualify for medicaid because many states are expanding the program's eligibility. otherwise you can look to your state's health insurance marketplace for a private insurance policy. you're likely to qualify for financial assistance that will lower the cost of your plan.
"first off whenever someone makes strong claims like that always ask them for the research they use to support those claims. because what happens is a complicated scientific manner gets translated into simple terms and a lot of the key information is lost. it's like a bad game of telephone. there is a theory called the ""opioid excess theory"" that certain people do not fully breakdown proteins such as gluten or casein and they remain as peptides that have an opioid-like effect. it has been hypothesized that long-term exposure to opiate peptides can affect the brain. it is thought that these peptides bind to opioid receptors in the brain which is similar to morphine-like substances. this is why gluten free diets are sometimes recommended for children with autism or attention deficit disorder. unfortunately there is not clear evidence that this diet works for every child suffering with such problems although there is quite a bit of antidotal evidence. i don't know of any research showing this occurs with gluten insensitive individuals. this is more of a theory focused on children with behavioral issues that may be applicable for teh general population but that is a big may. we need more research! always check with your healthcare provider before making chagnes in your diet such as giving up gluten."

"you ask a good question. shaky hands are actually not that uncommon and there are several possible causes. involuntary shaking is called "" tremor. "" tremor can affect the hands head and even the voice. several medical conditions can cause tremor including parkinson's disease liver failure alcoholism side effects from medications certain antidepressants and even certain types of poisoning. perhaps the most common cause of tremor is a condition called ""essential tremor. "" it is not dangerous. it tends to run in families. it can be annoying -- and it will never get better -- but at least it's not life-threatening or anything like that. if your hands have recently begun shaking you should see a doctor to rule out any underlying medical issue like parkinson's disease. if your tremor is caused by a medical condition chances are it can be treated. your doctor can also tell you if you have essential tremor. wishing you well! we get hand shaking while we start new activity which we never face before. its a common problem. this problem more effect in student when they start their writing. even master degree students we can see that they get suffering from thesis writing. i had also face this problem. it was when i doing my pg. but i could avoid my handshaking by coming of thesis writing service. thesis writing service is one of best and cheapest writing service which is more useful to outlining structuring and formatting essays document for students. thesis writing service provide writing tips for students."
"yes this can be common as it can take up to two years after the first period for the ovaries to completely mature and produce regular ovulations every month. in the early years of menstruation estrogen production is more than adequate to build up a thickened lining in the uterus. but without regular ovulations not enough progesterone is made. as you may know in a normal cycle estrogen is produced all month. estrogen is responsible for building up the lining of your uterus so you have something to shed each month. in a normal cycle progesterone production increases following ovulation. progesterone ""stabilizes"" the uterine lining in preparation for a possible implantation of a new pregnancy. if you are not pregnant that month the levels of estrogen and progesterone fall triggering the release of the uterine lining—your period. so if you do not ovulate the estrogen build up of the lining continues but without the usual ovulation associated progesterone. thus the hormone levels don't decline and the lining stays up inside the uterus as a missed/late period. alternatively the lining can begin to shed under its own weight producing prolonged and erratic bleeding--this is likely what has happened to her. another way inadequate progesterone production from missed ovulations can create too heavy a flow is as follows. simply stated if the uterine lining is like grass or lawn estrogen is like the fertilizer (causes proliferation and a thickening of the lining ) and progesterone is like the lawnmower (keeps the lining thin by three different mechanisms). this is why depoprovera (high dose synthetic progesterone) brings about a thin lining and why birth control pills (relatively progesterone dominant) bring about shorter lighter periods. it is also why women who miss ovulations (no progesterone produced) are at a greater risk for too thick lining. lastly less than % of adolescent women with heavy menstrual bleeding have an undiagnosed blood clotting disorder. this would be more likely if she had a family history of von willebrand's syndrome. given the duration of her bleeding i would urge you to have her see either your gyn a pediatrician or your family md. a short course of hormones may be helpful in stopping this distressing bleeding pattern yes it is nothing to worry about. this could mean instead of one egg a month she produces . i get mine every  das alsoand always have and i am . my mom had the same thing."

many in the medical field consider otc sleeping aids to be a controversial treatment for insomnia. caution should be exercised before taking of these medications even by individuals who do not possess a comorbid conditions such as glaucoma. these otc sleeping aids typically contain antihistamines such as diphenhydramine. this active ingredient may provide a sedative effect. it may also produce an anticholinergic effect on the body. one of those anticholinergic effects can cause the pupil to dilate and obstruct eye drainage. it could possibly increase eye pressure to unsafe levels. this phenomenon occurs more often with closed angle than open angle glaucoma. it is suggested to discuss the type of glaucoma that was diagnosed and to determine if otc sleeping aids will precipitate a closed angle glaucoma emergency.

it is okay to use pull-ups in day-care. for now otherwise you may be looking for another place for him to be during the day. many day-care facilities require that he be completely potty-trained. he is going through a very rough time with the divorce so this may take time and understanding. if need be you can consult a child psychologist to help him but things should improve. absolutely no punishment if he soils or wets a pull-ups but positive reinforcement is important when he does use the potty. do not talk about the divorce in front of him or allow him to overhear you on the phone when you are talking to your friends. reassure him that his parents love him and that this will not change. he may be very worried about moving. or living in two different houses. so you need to help him. the divorce was not his fault but he is suffering too.
most helpful answer the easy answer would be any exercise. find an activity that you like. it can be as simple as walking (aerobic) or even taking up a sport like tennis. the best exercise program is really one that you will do on a regular consistent basis at least three or more times per week. find a partner - it is easier to exercise with a friend.
as women reach their thirties they experience a decline in fertility. furthermore complications during pregnancy are more common when women reach age . age-related decline in fertility may be due in part to the following: a decrease in the number and health of the eggs to be ovulated. changes in the hormones resulting in altered ovulation. fewer number of eggs. a decrease in sperm counts. a decrease in the frequency of intercourse. the presence of other medical and gynecologic conditions such as endometriosis which may interfere with conception.
herpes simplex virus can be spread in that manner if this person had herpes and you were susceptible to getting it. since many people have antibodies for herpes already from a past infection (even from a child) you may not be susceptible. if you are then keep in mind that not all exposed people will get it. if you were exposed only time will tell. herpes can take several weeks to a few months after exposure before you may see an herpetic break out. sadly brushing your teeth using listerine and wiping off that pipe beforehand did not lower your risk.

hi. it seems that you still have epididymo orchitis. its been chronic and long standing now and some amount of inflammation still seems to have remained inside. at such young age you should not neglect it. get a usg scan done to see whats wrong. consult a general surgeon. anti inflammatory medicines will help. thanks
it's possible yes. if you get your insurance at work the affordable care act does require that young adults up to the age of  remain covered. however your company may not be required to cover maternity. though maternity coverage is part of the essential health benefits that individual and small business plans must cover many large employers are exempt from having to comply with this part of the law for dependents.
"you're smart to think about potential drug interactions. whenever you have questions about prescription medications you can check with a pharmacist. pharmacists represent a great resource for all types of drug-related questions including potential interactions. in fact it's a good idea to get all of your prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy. that way the pharmacist is more likely to catch potential drug interactions before you even receive the pills. i'm not a pharmacist myself but i don't believe there's any interaction between minocycline and terbinafine oral. one is an antibiotic and the other an antifungal. generally i believe these two drug classes ""play nice"" together. however you should ask your healthcare provider. if your provider knew you were taking minocycline he or she would not prescribe terbinafine unless it was safe to do so. wishing you well!"
the ma healthconnector is the ma insurance exchange -- an online tool where you can compare and shop for health plans. it is not an insurance company. do you recall signing up for a plan through a particular health insurance company such as tufts or ma blue cross blue shield? if so i suggest you call them directly to see if your application is in process.

there's actually been no studies done in pregnant women in the use of protonix. so at this point it is not recommended. now there are some situations where a physician may deem it completely fine for them to take but once again that doctor is going to monitor that pregnant patient pretty closely to make sure it's okay. but once again we don't have any study data available to find out if it's safe or not. so right now it is not recommended.
the effective and safe medication to abort migraine attack is ginger. one can take dry ginger powder in a dose of  to  gm twice a day as a preventive measure for migraine.
hydrocodone is a potent pain medication that is highly-addictive. it would not be likely that a medical professional would prescribe this opiate as an antidepressant or so that you can feel euphoric and more energetic any more than a medical provider would give you an amphetamine to speed you up. even people with chronic pain should be wary of addicting themselves to opiates. never is this used as an anti-depressant. narcotics are quite the opposite they cause deptession. however getting rid of your pain would be enough to make you feel better. but you may find over time you will need to increase your dosage. is the addiction to narcotics a fair trade off? depends on the pain and you need to follow your physicians instruction to the letter don't increase your dose without talking it over with your physician.
there is no specific treatment for this typically self-limited disease (the symptoms resolve without specific antiviral treatment in about two to  days). however symptomatic treatment (acetaminophen ) that reduces fever and discomfort is currently recommended. mouthwashes and sprays may lessen the oral discomfort. fluids are also suggested to prevent dehydration however acidic juices may irritate the mouth ulcers. cold milk may sooth the oral discomfort. some physicians use topical diphenhydramine (benadryl) containing gel or liquids to treat the hand and foot discomfort. the relatively rare complications of coxsackie virus infections (for example heart or brain infection) require special individualized treatments usually administered by an infectious disease consultant.

it's not a good idea to drink if you have barrett's esophagus. in this disorder the lining of the esophagus (the tube food passes through on its way from the mouth to the stomach) slowly changes at the cellular level until it resembles tissue of the intestine. these changes also can cause cancer to arise in a small percentage of people with barrett's esophagus. because barrett's esophagus is closely related to gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) treatment for barrett's typically includes lifestyle changes to reduce stomach acid. avoiding alcohol and spicy foods are among these changes. hope this helps!
the father's drug habit is adversely affecting everyone including him. his drug use is not causing the colic or crying spells so the baby should be examined by the pediatrician. incidentally colic -- if this is what is causing the crying -- improves at age three months so there may be brighter days soon. the drug use is a more serious problem. it is difficult enough to care for a baby but when one parent is impaired it can be next to impossible. the three month old will most likely get better but with drug use it can only get worse; perhaps to the point where the baby no longer has a father.
if youre wearing pajamas changing sheets once a week is fine. if youre not wearing pajamas or sleeping in the nude then youll probably want to be changing them at least twice a week. a lot of people when they change their sheets they dont wash their mattress pad and so thats another thing that people do. you need to have a couple of mattress pads that you can rotate in and out and change more often.
"to start an aerobic exercise program just put on your running shoes and start walking. it's fun -- and free. you can walk in your neighborhood at a local mall at school on the track. if walking is not your thing grab your bike and start riding. or swim laps. or do all of these! there are enough choices to let you do a different one each day for a month -- or longer. find your best time of day for exercise as you start an aerobic exercise program it's important to find the right time to exercise -- a time when you feel alert and energetic. this helps to make the exercise more fun and even easier. you may be a morning person and enjoy using a stationary bike before school. or if you're barely awake at  a. m. hit the track running at lunchtime during pe or after school. maybe swimming is what you love. so enjoy de-stressing while swimming laps on your school's team. exercise with a friend if you get bored easily and like to talk with someone invite a friend to be part of your aerobic exercise program. your friend can act as a coach motivator and conscience as well as give you someone to laugh with during exercise. some studies have found that exercising with someone increases the chance that you'll stick with the program. join an aerobic exercise class if you are social or need further instruction you might prefer being part of a fitness class. try an aerobics or gymnastics class at the local ""y "" an indoor cycling class at a fitness center or a school sports team: volleyball basketball football swimming. the options for aerobic exercise are numerous. just find what you like and make it your daily habit -- your gift to yourself! build your own gym at home if you like privacy and would rather exercise in the comfort of your own home set up a personal home gym. exercising at home allows you to choose the time of day you work out and exercise at your own pace."

what is the usual time to be developed? lack of any breast development by age thirteen merits some monitoring. the small firm breast buds usually appear about age eleven. by age thirteen a majority of girls have the beginnings of a mound-shape of breast tissue. unless there is an overt reason for lack of development such as illness radiation exposure or hormonal problems there is evidence that breast development can continue until ones early s. while most all of us have at least some difference in size between our two breasts there are situations where the size difference is very apparent. size differences which onset in teen years will likely equalize for about % of women. yours jane h-h

no. your access to insurance coverage will not be affected by how many people sign up.
at least call them - c. diff can be a really nasty disease so you will need expert advice. i'm including this answer in case anyone else has the same question.
"it's perfectly normal for a person's pulse and blood pressure to rise when they walk or run. this happens because the heart must pump more blood -- faster -- to serve oxygen to the body's tissues. in fact the whole purpose of ""aerobic"" activity like walking is to increase the heart rate. and if a person is ""out of shape"" (that is they are moving from a very sedentary lifestyle to a more active one) the rise in pulse rate and blood pressure is likely to occur more quickly than it would in someone whose body is used to physical activity. that said it's always a good idea to consult your doctor before starting any exercise program. i suspect your mother's primary care provider will clear her for an easy exercise program such as walking but it's better to check with the doctor first. i hate to dissuade anyone from walking because it's normally a harmless activity and a pulse of  isn't necessarily ""bad"" (in fact a pulse of  is lower than my own target heart rate ) but i cannot give medical advice. and so my suggestion is for your mother to check with her doctor to make sure walking is ok for exercise purposes. in general walking is among the safest and most effective ways to lose weight and get the heart (cardiovascular) system into shape. walking even for short periods of time or for short distances (to start) can be a good way to build up to more exertion such as jogging. wishing you well!"
"i don't know why but over the + years i've had it - i've noticed as soon as i change out of my clothing from the day i have this problem. i just figured it must have something to do with the area suddenly being exposed to oxygen. i've learned to not wear tight jeans during a breakout to avoid agitation. i have found it comforting to gently wash the area before bed with just water and a clean washcloth. another thing i've done for relief if it's unbearable which my husband came up with is: get chamomile tea bags; steep  in a bowl of hot water. lie on a folded towel you don't mind staining (or you'll ""make tea"" on your sheets); place the tea bag on the sore; re-steep and continue until the water's cold. it will help and relax you so you can sleep. but if the sore is already burst open and the chamomile agitates the skin - discontinue. then wear fresh all cotton white briefs underwear to bed (during a breakout even if you normally don't). and finally the zovirax cream is wonderful - just a little bit a few times a day / or of course following your dr's. instructions for dosing / right where the sore is -- and don't scratch! i don't take the zovirax pills as a preventative anymore. they make me feel a bit cruddy so with a mild breakout i just use the cream. but if i have swollen glands in my groin and/or have that ""just kicked in the crotch and hit by a truck"" feeling -- i take the pills for  days plus the cream. of course during a breakout we abstain from sex due to pain anyway. but for a while after healed use condoms! in  years i have not infected my husband. best wishes i know life with this illness is a drag but it is manageable & after a while doesn't seem like the end of the world. over time you should go long periods without breakouts. stress and lack of rest can bring them on so take good care of you. k"

there is really no set amount but a pre-teen girl does need plenty of calcium phosphorous protein and all of those nutrients found in milk and milk products. these minerals vitamins and protein can be found in many other food sources if she eats them. if she was allergic to milk she wouldn't be drinking any so these other non-milk sources would be essential to her. if she eats cheese yogurt or even ice cream she is getting milk in another form so the bottom line is: milk is a good healthy source of many nutrients but an exact amount cannot be determined unless we knew what she was eating. personally i like milk but humans are the only mammals on this planet that continue to drink milk after we have been weaned. we like it but we don't necessarily need it if we have a good diet.
a lot of seniors who have medicare coverage have questions about the impact of the affordable care act. the new law does not make major changes to the traditional medicare program. it does add some new coverage for preventive benefits and make some other changes - but nothing that should affect your medicare coverage. in addition nothing in the law will require you to change your secondary insurance from usaa. so you should not have to change coverage or change doctors.

i have always felt that redheads were special. anyone can have blonde brown or black hair but only a select few have red hair. i only knew two redheads as a child — sam and of course linda. i had serious thing for redheaded linda when i was in sixth grade. throughout history redheads were either revered or burned at the stake as witches. warts moles and freckles (common in redheads) were also considered signs of the devil by  century when they murdered about   of those afflicted solving the mystery why redheads were becoming scarce in those days. an old medical colleague rick had a real thing for redheads. we could be in a crowded conference room with a few hundred people. should a redhead walk-in his red-dar would start beeping and he would swoop over and make his move. it is apparently lucky to rub your hand on a redheads hair but dont try this on a strange woman at the mall or you may end up in jail. your amorous cellmate could have red hair. this would not be considered lucky. we now have four grandchildren with one on the way. two are redheads and not that subtle red that only parents can see. i am talking about real red (orange actually). my eldest stepson the father of these two redheads was not pleased. for most of his childhood he made it his mission to make fun of redheads mostly his carrot-topped friend bryan. it was a bit of poetic justice that he now has two of his own. red hair is one of lifes most pleasant genetic mutations. of the zillions of genes carried by humans only one — melanocortin  receptor — can cause red hair. in order to have a child born with red hair both parents must carry this gene mutation. in countries swimming with redheads this is going to happen more often. we were absolutely surprised and even questioned paternity when our two grandchildren emerged both from different mothers. working in pediatrics now i see a fair share of cute little redheads in my office. there are some redhead mothers too but one can never be sure these are natural redheads. i have learned not to ask. parents are particularly proud of their redheaded kids and like it when someone comments on how special it is. i keep hearing about a redhead personality  like mischievousness temperamental or feisty but i cant say i buy into that theory. for some unknown reason redheads require more general anesthesia (up to % more) than people with other hair colors. bees tend to sting redheads more and of course redheads (due to their fair skin) have a higher incidence of sunburns and skin cancers. less than % of the population is redheads with the highest percentage in scotland followed by ireland. about ten years ago my wife and i traveled to the british isles — england scotland wales and ireland — and saw this firsthand. redheads are quite prominent in australia too. these geographic areas are redhead central so i was puzzled when i heard that the future of human redheads may be genetically threatened in the next century. we cant have that.  incidentally there are no redheads in red china. of course a world without redheads is unlikely. the future may allow people to know the genetic make-up of their intended spouse thereby increasing the chance of having redheads in reducing the chance of say; having a child with big ugly feet like dad. i grew up with the humor of lucille ball a famous redhead who was enhanced by a bottle of henna. other famous redheads range from wilma flintstone the little mermaid little orphan annie ronald mcdonald bozo the clown raggedy ann (and andy) red (of course) skelton and carol burnett to such contemporary redheads as sarah ferguson and nicole kidman. if you were lucky enough to be born a redhead you have my admiration and respect. consider yourself special but not an endangered species. i would not want to live in a world without redheads so redheads of the worldunite! (if you know what i mean. ) the first person really sumed up everything but i wanted to add that new studies also show that people with red are less tolerance for pain whatever causes red hair also cause this i found that to be very interresting and thought youd like to know <positive_smiley>

you can prevent iron-deficiency anemia by eating a well-balanced diet that includes good sources of iron vitamin b- and folate. steps to take include the following: * if you are a vegetarian or vegan talk to your doctor or a nutritionist about your diet and any possible need for supplements. * ask your doctor or nutritionist if you should take vitamin c. vitamin c makes the stomach more acidic and can improve the absorption of iron in your diet. * decrease your consumption of caffeinated products and tea. these substances can decrease iron absorption. other offenders include the preservative edta fiber large amounts of calcium and the phytates found in some vegetables. * select iron-fortified cereals and breads. * carefully follow safety guidelines if your occupation involves work with lead-containing materials such as batteries petroleum and paint. * ask your doctor or local public-health authorities about getting your dishes and other eating utensils tested for lead.

most helpful answer i have a similar life. i'm a full time employee studying at grad school part time with a family. have you checked to see if your blood pressure is low or if you're anaemic? depression also could be causing your exhaustion. with little free time and many goals you could be mildly depressed. my doctor was very helpful in identifying issues for me. i hope this helps.
i'm sorry you're going through this. navigating the health care system can be very frustrating indeed! let me start by saying osteoporosis in and of itself can be quite painful. therefore it is possible there's nothing else wrong with your husband's shoulder. still i can understand your concern and desire to get further testing done. try not to be too hard on your husband's physicians. part of the problem may be his insurance carrier. if nothing showed up on x-ray your husband's insurance may not cover an mri. that's not the doctor's fault; that's just the rules set forth by the insurance company. that said if you want to push for further imaging studies ask to be referred to an orthopedic surgeon. a shoulder fracture may require surgical repair so it's not necessarily an unreasonable request. i wish you and your husband all the best in getting this sorted out. if the doctor said to go to the er and you did. let the doctor know this and therefore you've done what he told you to do. he should order the mri. my step mother had extreme pain in her shoulder and because of insurance purposes it took a minute or two before the doctor ordered the mri. finally she's doing great after he gave her a shot in her shoulder. sometimes you have to keep at him!
in a six-month clinical study a new three-product skin care regimen containing a deep wrinkle treatment with retinyl propionate was professionally tested and clinically proven to be as effective as the leading antiaging prescription brand indicated for reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles (. % tretinoin in an emollient base). others studies have shown that retinyl propionate may be less irritating to skin than the prescription retinoic acid retinaldehyde and retinol. it could provide a good alternative for women who cannot tolerate these retinoids.
"the biggest thing. is that the pathology is non-malignant. the main questions to ask your physician if you have not already would be whether he feels as though he got it all. additionally it might be worth asking if there was any dysplasia in the specimen. (dysplasia just means that the cells look ""funny"" like they are changing in some way. ) asking these questions might allow you to have a bit more of a discussion with your physician so that you could feel better about the plan. ."
treatment for chickenpox (varicella) depends on a person's age health and severity of the illness. healthy children with chickenpox may need only home treatment. this includes taking acetaminophen (such as tylenol ) or ibuprofen (such as advil) to reduce fever and discomfort. if you are not sure about the amount of medicine to give your child talk to your doctor or pharmacist. ( do not give aspirin to people younger than  because of the risk of reye syndrome ). over-the counter oral antihistamines may help reduce itching. but check with your child's doctor before giving them to your child. oatmeal baths and soothing lotions that don't contain antihistamines may also help. examples of lotions to use include calamine lotion or aveeno. healthy teens and adults with chickenpox usually have more severe symptoms than children and are at higher risk for complications than children. still most need only home treatment. all teens and adults with chickenpox should be seen by a health professional; some may need hospital care. pregnant women and people with immune system problems are also at increased risk for complications. they should see a health professional immediately if they suspect they have chickenpox. getting a shot of chickenpox antibodies may help delay or prevent a person from having chickenpox. and sometimes antiviral medicines are given to shorten the length of the illness. if you have not had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine and you think you've been exposed to the virus you may be able to get the chickenpox vaccine (what is a pdf document? ). this may prevent you from having the illness or make the illness milder. it is recommended that the vaccine be given within  days after exposure to chickenpox. if you can't get the shot within  days getting it up to  hours ( days) after exposure may still help.  webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

a pregnancy test only reacts to the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg). however if you are pregnant this hormone will not be present in your urine or blood until  to  days after ovulation (the release of an egg) which is around the time that you would normally get your period. until this time has passed it will not be possible to see a positive result in a pregnancy test. urine tests require a certain level of hcg to be present in order to indicate a positive pregnancy result. blood tests are more sensitive because they can detect a smaller amount of hcg which means that pregnancies can be picked up earlier usually between six to eight days after ovulation. you can have a blood test at your gp surgery but it is recommended that you take a home urine test before booking an appointment. source :- pharmacysell.

if you always experience a lack of periods (amenorrhea) when your weight drops below a certain point then that is a sign that your lower weight is not enough to sustain normal periods. while estrogen often decreases when body fat and weight dips too low that may not always be the case. the female body needs a certain percentage of body fat to allow the hormones to work properly. this mixed with strenuous exercise and perhaps a diet lacking in key nutrients and calories is enough to keep your body from having periods. my suggestion to you is to see a registered dietitian who specializes in sports nutrition. they can look at your diet activity level and weight and provide recommendations to stay healthy which includes regular periods. you can find a dietitian near you at eatright. org. good luck and take care of yourself!
at the beach not only do i tend to sleep even better than normal many of the people i meet tend to tell me about how well they are sleeping here. sitting in the cool breeze listening to the ocean and watching my kids surf and build sand castles i thought about why everyone seems to sleep better at the beach. here are my thoughts on the phenomenon: . the environment. remember you are on vacation. this in and of itself is a time for relaxation (hopefully) and a change of sleep environment (one which lacks the reminders of your daily stress) certainly helps set the tone for more relaxation and usually better sleep. . the schedule. many of my patients tell me that they have a tendency to sleep in on vacation thus catching up on their much-needed rest and reducing their sleep deprivation. . the heat. being out in the sun all day always makes people sleepy. why? well it may be because of the slight rise in core body temperature. remember an increase in body temp will cause a subsequent fall and that can be a signal to the brain to release melatonin — the key that starts the engine for sleep. . the sounds. remember ocean sounds are the only documented sounds that have been shown to help with sleep. try sleeping with the window slightly open to hear the ocean. . the activity. most people at the beach are doing one of many activities of a physical nature. i was inspired to go for an early morning run not to mention lugging all the beach paraphernalia setting up the umbrella swimming tennis you name it. there are so many activities to choose from. and it is great to be able to exercise which we know can help promote better sleep. . the weather. not only may the heat help with sleep but the barometric pressure could be helpful as well. while there is little data yet (one or two studies) my theory is that the changes to sea level affect the body and in fact help with sleep onset and sleep continuity. . the light. lets face it being out in the sun during the day is one of the best ways to reset your internal biological clock which helps regulate your sleep cycle. so there you have it my seven reasons for better sleep at the beach. whatever the reason my prescription is for anyone if they can get out to the beach and get some great sleep.

many cases of epilepsy can be prevented by wearing seatbelts and bicycle helmets putting children in car seats and other measures that prevent head injury and other trauma. prescribing medication after first or second seizures or febrile seizures also may help prevent epilepsy in some cases. good prenatal care including treatment of high blood pressure and infections during pregnancy can prevent brain damage in the developing baby that may lead to epilepsy and other neurological problems later. treating cardiovascular disease high blood pressure infections and other disorders that can affect the brain during adulthood and aging also may prevent many cases of epilepsy. finally identifying the genes for many neurological disorders can provide opportunities for genetic screening and prenatal diagnosis that may ultimately prevent many cases of epilepsy.
yes you can be overweight and in good shape at the same time. in fact physiologists now believe that being overweight and fit is far healthier than being skinny and out of shape. how much healthier? one recent study of   people shows that subjects who were unfit were four times more likely to die than those who were very fit —whether those fit people were normal weight overweight or obese. thats because exercise — no matter how much you weigh — reduces your risk of a broad range of ailments including cardiovascular disease cancer and diabetes.

warm water lavage (irrigation) is safe at virtually any age but unless you plan on getting very very wet the child should be old enough to cooperate and sit still while you do it. you need to do it properly and with the right equipment and you need to have a good home otoscope (a home medical device to look in the ear canal. about $) to check your progress. don't use any instrumentation inside a child's ear unless you have been trained to do so and are experienced.

yes it is silly. an eclipse cannot hurt you or your unborn baby. you are completely safe even without red underwear (do they even come in maternity sizes? ) or a safety pin. i wouldn't recommend staring into the sun during a solar eclipse however. i love to hear about these folk tales and their origins. i bet this one goes back a hundred years perhaps started by a crafty clothing merchant trying to sell off some excess red underwear inventory.
this is something you should definitely talk to your doctor about. some doctors do recommend that their patients not drink alcohol after gastric bypass surgery. that's because it appears your body may metabolize alcohol differently and that alcohol may actually get into your system more quickly. in addition a recent study showed a link between gastric bypass surgery and alcohol problems after surgery. that doesn't mean the surgery will make you an alcoholic. we don't fully understand the link at this point but it's something to be aware of. here's more information about that study <link>

"everyone is a little different in terms of how they feel in the morning. if you eat light at night you will tend to wake up relatively hungry. whereas if you tend to snack a lot at night and/or eat a large or heavy meal for dinner. it might take a while for your body to experience hunger in the morning. it takes my body and my daughter's body a couple of hours to ""wake up "" so i eat my breakfast when i feel hungry (usually around  a. m. instead of when i wake up around : a. m. ) and my daughter in high school packs a snack for mid-morning (since she isn't ready to eat first thing in the morning)."

"hi: i think i'm in the same boat as you. i'm the most active healthiest person i currently know but i am also the most overweight too ( pounds but a size -). i eat a very healthy diet. gluten-free no junk food lots of fish no dairy. no added sugars. lots of fresh fruits and veggies. i drink  to  litres of water a day. i keep my calorie count to between  to  a day. i try to get  hours of sleep every night. i supplement my nutrition with  complex vitamins an iron supplment a raw multivitamin amino acid supplement msm and chondroitin joint supplements and omega  supplements. i workout like it's my part time job. i try to run  days a week for at least  to  miles. i walk my dog every day for at least  miles. i do weight training  times a week with a personal trainer. i do muay thai kickboxing on saturdays for an hour and a half and kung fu on tuesdays and thursdays for two hours each. sounds like a lot right? what can i say? i enjoy it. even with all of that i struggle to lose the weight. i am lucky if i drop one to two pounds a week. for most two pounds a week is great but they don't exert themselves half as much as i do. i just don't get it. i got my thyroids checked and it all came back normal. my brother and i are the two most obese ones in our family. everyone else didn't grow up fat ( kids in all). i wonder if it does have something to do with genetics. it's so frustrating. it's taken me  years to lose about  pounds and then wham! in a matter of  months i gained back  pounds. i was still exercising regularly although not at the same intensity level (did just karate twice a week and cardio kickboxing  times a week) and i only slightly laxed on my clean eating habits and boom!  pounds. i didn't eat junk food just went to ""regular"" food and the pounds piled back on so quickly. so frustrated."

a carbohydrate is the chemical name for sugars and grains. carbohydrates always contain the elements carbon hydrogen and oxygen. fruits breads pasta potatoes beans cereal and rice are high in carbohydrates or carbs.  many vegetables are also rich in carbohydrates. soft drinks candy and most other sweet junk foods also contain highly processed carbohydrates. natural carbohydrates are an important part of a healthy diet. the healthiest carbs are in whole grains vegetables fruits and beans. these foods are filled with other nutrients along with carbohydrates. our bodies have to work a bit to digest these carbs. processed carbohydrates such as high-fructose corn syrup are unhealthy when consumed regularly in large amounts. experts believe they are too-easily digested causing blood sugar spikes that might contribute to developing diabetes and other health problems.
discomfort or sensitivity. your newly crowned tooth may be sensitive immediately after the procedure as the anesthesia begins to wear off. if the tooth that has been crowned still has a nerve in it you may experience some heat and cold sensitivity. your dentist may recommend that you brush your teeth with toothpaste designed for sensitive teeth. pain or sensitivity that occurs when you bite down usually means that the crown is too high on the tooth. if this is the case call your dentist. he or she can easily fix this problem. chipped crown. crowns made of all porcelain can sometimes chip. if the chip is small a composite resin can be used to repair the chip with the crown remaining in your mouth. if the chipping is extensive the crown may need to be replaced. loose crown. sometimes the cement washes out from under the crown. not only does this allow the crown to become loose it allows bacteria to leak in and cause decay to the tooth that remains. if your crown feels loose contact your dentist's office. crown falls off. sometimes crowns fall off. usually this is due to an improper fit or a lack of cement. if this happens clean the crown and the front of your tooth. you can replace the crown temporarily using dental adhesive or temporary tooth cement that is sold in stores for this purpose. contact your dentist's office immediately. he or she will give you specific instructions on how to care for your tooth and crown for the day or so until you can be seen for an evaluation. your dentist may be able to re-cement your crown in place; if not a new crown will need to be made. allergic reaction. because the metals used to make crowns are usually a mixture of metals an allergic reaction to the metals or porcelain used in crowns can occur but this is extremely rare. dark line on crowned tooth next to the gum line. a dark line next to the gum line of your crowned tooth is normal particularly if you have a porcelain-fused-to-metal crown. this dark line is simply the metal of the crown showing through.

hi yes all these symptoms are related to allergies. get allergen test done and find out the exact allergen. take anti histaminic and vitamin tablets. get thyroid tests done. thanks
since your sister is the one treating you with her (unfinished) medication perhaps this question should be directed to her. i am never of fan of this practice. i think it is dangerous. since many illnesses are viral antibiotiics do absolutely nothing. apparently the medical provider at urgent care did not feel that you needed any antibiotic let alone a sulfa drug or azithromycin. the fact that a z-pack has worked for you in the past in no way implies that each year you have the same identical bacterial infection that responds to azithromycin. statistically this would be highly unlikely. illnesses do change over time. most people get better on their own but a few do get worse. if you feel you are now sicker than when you were evaluated by urgent care than it would be better to be re-evaluated again. perhaps you do need an antibiotic now but there is no way for me to make that determination over the internet. this would be the right thing to do. taking someone else's leftover antibiotic is not.
"it appears that his medical provider wasn't sure either since he treated him for otitis externa (""swimmer's ear) and an oral antibiotic most likely for a middle ear infection. both these types can cause a purulent drainage and a painful middle ear infection can cause the eardrum to rupture. unless the debris/pus in the ear canal is removed one cannot really determine the source of the drainage. most primary care medical providers do not have the suction device needed to clean out this canal so they tend to ""shotgun"" the treatment plan in hopes that one or both will work. when the ear canal is plugged up with this gunk the drops will rarely penetrate enough to do anything but use both the drops and the oral antibiotic (not sure what he is taking however) as the medical provider ordered and this drainage should eventually stop. if it does not and your son is still having a painful ear an ent may need to examine him."
if it was. everyone would be using it. unfortunately it is not a cure but you can do it if you want.
hi. it looks like infection in the parotid gland that can be viral or bacterial in origin. you should consult an oral physician and get evaluated and investigation like x ray saliva culture salivary amylase can help in ruling out the exact cause and treatment can be done accordingly. as of now take a combination of anti-inflammatory painkillers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. do cool compresses over the cheek. hope this helps.
smoking and pulmonary exertion can definitely effect asthma. if you have been told you may have it in the past my advice would be this; . put down the cigs and avoid smoke strong smells and fast temp changes (i. e. stepping out of a warm car into cold air. ) . start deep breathing exercises. my doctor had me start with just ten a day. he said to find a quiet relaxing place where i can time my breaths. breath in slowly and deeply until it is uncomfortable and hold it until you can't. do this ten times timing each trying to hold it the same amount with each breath. each night try holding it a little longer. you will be amazed how well this will help . check with a doctor. your lungs are just one of the things that may be causing shortness of breath. you may need an inhaler to help open your pulmonary tubes. . ask ten smokers over  when they started and why. also ask if they had it to do over again would they do the same. both my kids tried smoking in college. after doing the math on how much the habit will cost in a life time and talking to experienced smokers they both decided to stop before it became additive and believe me no matter how little you use cigs they will become additive. good luck! and use your head!
my mom's cousin says she can no longer taste food because of a side effect of metformin and now weighs less than  pounds. have you noticed this in your patients? no loss of taste sensation is not an expected side effect of metformin and i cannot recall any patients i've met with this side effect however it is certainly possible that there are some patients out there with this side effect and if your mom's cousin believes it then it is probably true in her case. naturally there are medical conditions that could cause loss of taste sensation and weight loss independent of diabetes.

that's an interesting question. for those who aren't familiar with fatty liver disease it's a condition in which fat literally encases the liver and clogs it up. this can cause the liver to become inflamed or scarred. when it becomes scarred the liver cannot function properly. liver scarring cannot be reversed. if your fatty liver disease has not caused inflammation and scarring you stand a good chance of reversing it. here are a few things you can do: . stop drinking alcohol. although fatty liver disease is not the same as cirrhosis caused by alcoholism consuming alcohol can damage the liver. . lose weight. new research suggests a slow weight loss of up to % of your body weight can help reduce the amount of excess fat in your liver. . if you have diabetes make sure you control your sugars. diabetes can put you at higher risk of developing fatty liver disease. . eat healthy. it's that simple. wishing you well!

i suggest if you do overhead presses that you do with them dumbbells. the child will not remain still when you lift him and dumbbells will work more on stabilizing muscles than a machine. all upper body exercises are going to help you. you need shoulders and arms to lift but also upper and lower back and abs to stabilize your torso. and then of course legs to steady you. i suggest a full body workout including exercises that mimic the movements you do when you lift him. so if you lift him overhead then you need to do some overhead lifts like the presses and the lateral raises and front raises will be helpful too. i suggest dumbbells for those exercises too. you could do deadlifts which would be great for stabilizing your torso and strengthening all back muscles and squats as well. .
an ankle sprain happens to many people. if you have been walking and there is a ditch or the road is lower your ankle can turn and cause and injury to the ligaments. ankle sprains can be mild moderate or severe. if you have injured only a little bit of the ligament you may be able to walk on the foot and just have mild swelling. with a more severe sprain you will not be able to walk. most importantly it is important to treat the ankle well while healing. this means full rest elevation of the ankle ice and medicine to reduce the swelling. stay off of that foot either resting or with crutches for at least - days. if you did not do that it is possible that the ankle ligament is not properly healed. in your case its important to see your doctor again if it is still causing you pain.

"no these are all basically worthless ""quack"" gimmicks. don't waste your time or money. pheromones are real but as far as i know human pheromones have not been successfully tested for efficacy. you really can't spray an expensive substance on your skin and expect the others to be magically attracted to you and offer themselves for unbridled sex. while subtle smells are important a potential partner will likely be more attracted to a nice smile and a pleasant personality not how you smell. human pheromones are in sweat but i don't suggest that you try to attract someone with stinky body odor. ion and power bracelets are absolutely worthless. period. there are no pills or vitamins that will increase the size of your penis. your penis reaches it maximum size by age  and there is no substance that can make your penis feet or hands bigger. many men feel their penises are smaller but in controlled studies of zillions of men the size of the penis (when erect) does not vary that much. devices like hanging weights on this delicate member that claim the penis can be enlarged do not work and are potentially dangerous. sexual performance is an art and the most skilled artists do not use large paintbrushes or rollers. the most important sex organ is your brain."

last week i did one of my teaching stints at the usc medical school. we work with medical students to teach them how to examine the nose and other structures of the face head and neck. were not teaching them cosmetic surgery; that is not appropriate for undergraduate medical students. it is appropriate and important for them to understand the anatomy of the structures of the face including the nose the nasal passages and even the sinuses. once you are a specialist – particularly a superspecialist – you forget how difficult it is to master early in your studies even the simple examination of the nose. to be able to coordinate using an instrument to open the nostrils and a light to look in and to understand what you are seeing isnt so simple when you are only a sophomore or junior medical student. interestingly the technology available hasnt changed much since i was a medical student; there is just no substitute for some of the simple things that are used that can fit into your pocket. yes the light bulbs are stronger and the batteries last longer but other than that the instruments that comprise the head and neck diagnostics for looking into noses ears and eyes havent changed much. it is interesting to listen to the students and to observe their amazement when we explain to them that they need to master the examination of the ears and the nose and even the mouth because % of human illnesses take place in the head and neck. common things do occur commonly such as the common cold.  we train our students to master the techniques of asking the right questions when a patient presents with some symptoms. for example if a patient comes in with a blocked nose it is very important that the young doctor learn to ask about a history of nasal allergies. what about the history of a broken nose? when did you start to have trouble breathing? is it at night only? do you have more trouble in certain environments? for example is arizona better for your nose than california? is it worse in the summer versus the winter? have you been using nose sprays? what medications have you tried? has anything been helpful? you see medical practice has a certain commonality regardless of specialty. the doctor must be a good listener and pose good and meaningful questions. now you know why sir arthur conan doyle a physician was the author of the sherlock holmes books. a wise doctor and a savvy detective follow the same rules.

yes absolutely. if she is worried of possibly being pregnant then its always a possibility if she has been active in sex. i would think the next best question to ask is. could she be pregnant with my baby in which case i would highly doubt the possibility. you must ejaculate. she must be exposed to some way of having sperm get into her. otherwise either she is really young and fear filled from ignorance and myths she is a manipulator trying to make you feel guilty or she thinks she really is and has had sex with someone else and is still a manipulator trying to make you think its yours. you dont give her age or experiance or other times of sexual encounter.

lupus is an autoimmune disease which means that the body's natural defense system ( immune system ) attacks its own tissues instead of attacking foreign substances like bacteria and viruses. this causes inflammation. inflammation causes swelling pain and tissue damage throughout the body. if you develop severe lupus you may have problems with your kidneys heart lungs nervous system or blood cells. lupus is the common name for systemic lupus erythematosus also called sle. although some people with lupus have only mild symptoms the disease is lifelong and can become severe. but most people can control their symptoms and prevent severe damage to their organs. they do this by seeing their doctors often for checkups getting enough rest and exercise and taking medicines. this topic focuses on systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) the most common and most serious type of lupus. but there are four other types of lupus : discoid or cutaneous lupus drug-induced systemic lupus neonatal lupus and subacute cutaneous lupus. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

assuming the prescription belongs to you you're in the early part of your pregnancy and your ob/gyn knows about it then you and your baby should be ok. many women take prescription opioids such as hydrocodone during pregnancy and these appear to be pretty safe. however using any pain relievers (even over-the-counter ones) late in pregnancy (third trimester) can be risky for both mother and fetus. you should get your ob/gyn's advice and direction on this subject. keep in mind it's never ok to take narcotics that have not been prescribed to you. pregnant or not you should only take narcotics under the supervision of a doctor or other qualified medical professional. wishing you well!

"we tend to get re-exposed to various types of strep throughout our lives. what you are experiencing now as an adult would have nothing to do with your negative test as an infant. yes strep b as well as several other bacterial (strep is not a virus) types can grow out of a urine culture when you have an urinary tract infection but this was not lingering on since birth. strep throat is due to group a strep -- a different ""bug"" entirely."
i'm not sure why this is happening but it is common. dairy is certainly a possible culprit but you say you've cut it out before you run. here are some additional tips. . avoid caffeine and warm fluids. they can increase intestinal motility. . limit high-fiber foods. you may want to track the food you eat the day before too. . avoid any other foods that you know upset your stomach or give you gas. . stay well hydrated (dehydration slows digestion of food and cause stomach problems). i recommend - ounces of water - minutes before you run and - ounces every  minutes during the run. importantly avoid replacement beverages like gatorade since the sugar can increase motility. . avoid aspirin ibuprofen products with sorbitol or large doses of vitamin c. all of these can cause diarrhea or otherwise upset your stomach. . try a bland food like half a bagel and nothing else - minutes before you train. . pepto bismol can help too. . if possible empty your bowel before you run. if it continues you should consult your doctor to rule out any medical problem.

no medical provider can require an adult person to take a urine drug test. they can ask refuse to give them any more pain medications or legally terminate their professional relationship but they cannot really force anyone to pee. the repercussions for not complying to the doctor's request for a urine drug screen would be his refusal to prescribe further pain prescriptions. proper pain management is essential for a person who had brain surgery and other chronic pain issues (fibromyalgia) but it is the doctor's responsibility to make sure that highly-addictive pain medications are not be diverted to others or misused. the doctor has no legal responsibility to prescribe medical marijuana but may be able to refer your family member to a pain management specialist for on-going care. yes they can especially if you r on a pain med contract and you signed it and agreed to it!
first thing i would advise you to do is see a doctor. a family doctor or e. r. doctor first. you may have a vaginal infection that is causing the pain in your lower back. additionally severe pressure from constipation can cause back pain as well. a vaginal exam and a x-ray is a must for first step. and then see if that doctor can give diagnosis and treatment to help you. if not see specialist orthopedic and gyno. infection can cause weakness but so can other things like fibromyalgae so i would see a doctor soon. long term harmful effects will depend on what the problem is and how soon you get help. hope this helped you and that you feel better soon. god bless

i'm sorry you're going through this. it's always scary when we have a problem with our eyes! the first thing to clarify is this: is it your actual eyeball that's twitching? or is it your eyelid? twitching of the eyelid is called blepharospasm and is quite common. it tends to come and go as you described. it can get worse and more frequent from time to time and then clear up for long periods. stress fatigue and caffeine are common culprits of blepharospasm. if it's your eyeball that's twitching that would be more worrisome to me. when a person's eyeballs twitch it's usually both of them. if your eyeball itself is the problem i'd advise you to see a doctor. i realize you said you don't have insurance but most communities have free or low-cost health care clinics. you could start by getting checked at one of those just to calm any fears you may have about this situation. i wish you all the best!

acetaminophen and ibuprofen are the two best over-the-counter fever relievers. you should check with your pharmacist to determine the proper dose for the patient. also keep in mind that most fevers occur due to some sort of infection. so it is usually recommended that you see your doctor if you are running a fever.
no. although you may be able to spot and kill a bed bug or two that doesnt get at the root problem which is the infestation itself. professionals consider bedbugs the single most difficult pest to eliminate. its not a do-it-yourself pest.
the single worst thing you can do to a pimple is pick. these are not surgical instruments you should not be doing this to your skin. so i do prefer those blackhead removing tools over using your fingers and a tissue. but i also think that this is something that should be done by your dermatologist in order to have the best chance at extracting the contents of that blackhead without leaving a scar. so anytime you pick at the skin in any way; whether it's using the tool or your fingers you do have some risk of scarring. so every pimple blackhead whitehead or a pustule or papule all starts out as a same thing. our face is covered with lots of little hair follicles which are called pores. at the base of those follicles there can be some bacteria that grows as well called p. acnes. for some reason which we don't fully understand why that is the opening of the follicle can become blocked and that means that all the contents behind it has no place to go it can't get to the surface. so as it builds up it can create a little bump on the surface and it can look a little bit white that's a whitehead. if it opens to the surface it gets oxidized and that's a blackhead. so a blackhead isn't dark because it's dirty it's dark because there is oxidation that goes on and makes it look dark. if there is a p. acnes bacteria that's growing at the base of that follicle now that the follicle is closed this kind of bacteria loves an environment where there is no oxygen. so once the covering gets closed there is no more oxygen the bacteria wakes up and it has all this great food; its got the oils from the oil glands that are produced there and all the proteins from the skin cells that are clogged behind it. and now its got an abundance of food supplies so it starts to flourish and that can look like a pimple. so when you pick at it what you do is you create an inflammatory response which makes it red and angry and can make it more likely to persist or last longer and more likely to scar and more likely to come back in the same spot so picking is very bad. but your dermatologist can help extract that for you or give you a treatment like a retinoid or a topical antibiotic that can get rid of that pimple for you much more quickly and safely.
it is going to take a lot of goat milking. or a lot of money to buy the goat milk in order to fill up that bathtub. i think that bathing in goat's milk or any milk would be no more beneficial than bathing in water. the human skin does not really absorb milk through it.
in most cases you don't need antibiotics to treat an ear infection unless it is severe. penicillin is not the drug of choice; amoxicillin is currently the recommended drug should an antibiotic be medically prescribed. if you are self-diagnosing and self-prescribing then i recommend that you don't do it.
prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in american men and the second leading cause of deaths from cancer after lung cancer. the estimated lifetime risk of being diagnosed with the disease is . % for caucasians and . % for african americans. the lifetime risk of death from prostate cancer similarly is . % and . % respectively. as reflected in these numbers prostate cancer is likely to impact the lives of a significant proportion of men that are alive today. over the years however the death rate from this disease has shown a steady decline and currently more than  million men in the u. s. are still alive after being diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point in their lives. although it is subject to some controversy many experts in this field therefore recommend that beginning at age  all men should undergo screening for prostate cancer.
it is possible that you have a form of eczema that is causing your fingers to peel and crack. many people experience a flare-up of this type of eczema especially when they change environments. this means a change of climate humidity sometimes food water etc. some people notice that their flare-ups occur when they have allergy symptoms and can benefit from antihistamines as well as using creams or lotions that do work. try to notice if your condition ever improves. make a note of the things in your life that are different and see if you can get an upper hand on this. treating it with steroid cream is one way to keep it from cracking to the point of bleeding.
hi. the swelling is due to allergic reaction to the wasp poison. if its not improving then you should start on anti allergic tablets fibrinolytic enzyme tablets local magsulf and glycerine application. leg elevation. i would suggest hot fomentation instead of ice pack as ice pack will block and freeze the lymphatic system that is supposed to drain out the swelling. heat will increase the blood supply and help to drain out more swelling at a faster rate. thanks
"the short answer to your question is that the development of osteoarthritis does seem more prevalent in joints that have been injured in the past. so you may development osteoarthritis of your foot in the future. that said the midfoot is not a common place to develop osteoarthritis. (the big toe is a more common target for arthritis. ) in terms of whether or not you suffered a lisfranc injury it does sound like it from your description. a midfoot injury is deemed a ""lisfranc fracture"" (or dislocation or injury) when any of the metatarsal bones separates from the tarsus which is the cluster of bones from the heel to the midfoot. this usually happens due to a crushing injury like dropping a jar of pickles on your foot. athletes in certain sports are more prone to lisfranc injuries. these include football and snowboarding. lisfranc injuries occur in varying degrees of severity. slight dislocations often are treated just as you described with some type of splinting (an air cast). severe dislocations require surgery. hope this helps and that you get better soon!"

"let's say you've already had a healthy balanced meal so that you're not hungry (hunger is a physical phenomenon and tells the body ""i need food for survival"") but your appetite (appetite is a psychological phenomenon and is about ""i want food"" because it tastes great) get stirred up. that means you should be fine but you're getting tempted. here are a few things you can do to quell appetite and rein in over-eating: ) brush your teeth and/or use mouth wash. that'll take the tastiness out of most foods. ) if you have to have something eat something that expands your stomach with few calories--- a low cal soup lots of veggies. ) stay completely away from any sugary foods. the refined sugar will cause your insulin to spike and you'll end up with a ravenous appetite for more. talk about shooting yourself in the foot! ) get plenty of sleep! this keeps the levels of leptin (a hormone that helps you feel satisfied) high to help control appetite."

it is a lesion that may develop into cancer over time. there are many types of precancerous skin lesion colon lesions etc. some surgeons elect to remove them when they are in the innocent pre-cancerous stage rather than waiting until they become true cancers.
you are correct. dark red or brown urine could be blood although there are medications and even certain foods that can change the color of the urine. this would have nothing to do with your recent hep b vaccine. one common cause of blood in the urine would be a urinary tract infection even if you are not feeling any other symptoms. just the way a nose can suddenly bleed the bladder can do the same. this would be high on my list if you were female. urinary tract infections are uncommon in men. a kidney stone can cause urinary bleeding as well. i would be advisable for you to see your medical provider today and have a urinalysis to see if you are indeed having a urinary tract bleed. if not your medical provider can search for other possibilities. two nights ago had dark red urine?
no hives are not contagious. hives can appear from a allergic reaction ( eg. foods injections etc. ) allergy medication such as bendryl can take the terrible itch away and dense up the color. if one spot goes away another cluster can form. if you have chest tightness a fever or trouble swallowing get to the hospital. hives can last for days months or even years.
"i am unclear as to what you mean by his body creating ""bad bacteria"" and what relationship this might have to his headaches or back problems. obviously there is much in the news about the advantages of probiotics (good bacteria) but i do not know enough about your friend to know if probiotics would help. my belief is that adding ""good bacteria"" will not really help his headache or back. there can be sooooo many different causes of headache and back pain that it would be in his best interest to work closely with his healthcare provider until this issue has been properly evaluated and solved."
so if your partners body odor is keeping you awake theres a few things you want to do. number one is look at their diet. body odor is very consistent with what it is you are eating. if youve ever heard of people sweating garlic you know what that means is that people who have high garlic content you can actually smell it in their body odor. oftentimes i have people shower before bed and change their clothes before bed. having a specific night wear specifically some type of pajamas is what youre looking for. oftentimes if youre going to have somebody who wears the same pajamas over and over actually a polyester is going to be better than cotton because cotton will absorb all of that odor when and the sweat whereas the poly-blend probably wont.

i can't see the rash to offer you a patient-specific answer but those one year old vaccines are live vaccines with a two week incubation period so it is common for the chicken pox and the measles-mumps-rubella (mmr) vaccine to cause a mild rash. if this is related to the vaccine then there is really nothing that needs to be done. it will resolve on its own in a few days. keep in mind however that there are hundreds of other things that can cause a rash.

the most serious cause of black stools is bleeding from somewhere in the gi tract. bleeding in the stomach esophagus or intestines can turn into a black color by the time it leaves the body as stool. this can be caused by bleeding ulcers stomach inflammation broken blood vessels in the esophagus called varices or tumors. this type of bleeding can be life-threatening. the bleeding can also come from a nosebleed or from the mouth if blood is swallowed. black stools can also be caused by supplements such as iron or medicines such as pepto-bismol. certain foods like blueberries or black licorice can also turn the stool black. your doctor can tell if there is any blood in the stool by taking a stool sample from the rectum and performing a simple test in the office. if you are having any black or tarry stools call your doctor right away.

"i don't know. i can't see them examine you nor do i know anything about you or your medical history. there is no way for me or any medical provider to be able to blindly guess that nature of your ""sores"" based on vague description. if you would like to have a definitive answer. a diagnosis. after a year and a half of worry then i strongly suggest that you see an ent specialist for a high-level examination."
i can't see it as you know nor can i take a more detailed medical history or examine you to narrow down the possibilities. this can be a bite (spider? ) or you may have secondary infection. just a blind guess. without a hands-on examination you cannot be properly diagnosed or treated so i suggest that you seek a medical evaluation today.

obviously you will have some complications of the chemical substance you have drunk. mucosa of upper gastrointestinal and respiratory tract is more sensible to react against chemicals than the stomach. also you have protected your stomach somehow by using allegra (fexofenadine) pantos (pantoprazole) and sucralfate. now i would recommend you to consult an ent specialist to check your throat and ear tubes. i suggest you take allegra dexamethasone  mg twice daily and if your ears or nose feels blocked then xylometazoline by nasal drops. consult your doctor discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. you would better consult an ent doctor and a gastroenterologist as soon as possible for further information consult an internal medicine physician online --> <link>
"methergine (methylergonovine) is an ""ergotamine"" type of medication. it is on the market as a treatment for uterine bleeding (that is the fda approved use). similar medications were used to treat headaches in the past. it should work for migraine. it is a very strong blood vessel constrictor and has a number of serious side effects (some of the side effects caused by long term use could be permanent). we don't use this medication in our clinic so i'm not sure how long it should take to work."
cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder. specifically cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease. this means that to get the disease you must inherit the changed (mutated) gene from both parents. keep in mind: if a person inherits the changed gene from only one parent he or she will not develop cystic fibrosis but will be a carrier of the disease. carriers may pass the cystic fibrosis gene defect onto their children. if you are planning a pregnancy and you are white talk to your doctor about having a genetic test to determine your chances of having a child with cystic fibrosis. the disease is much more common in white people than in people of other races. the way that you eat how much you exercise whether you smoke or the kind of environment you live in does not cause cystic fibrosis. but if you have cystic fibrosis changes in your environment (such as not being around smokers) or changes in your behavior (such as eating the right kinds of foods) can help you feel better and live longer. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.
osteoarthritis or oa can affect any joint. most often it's seen in the joints of the hands feet knees hip or spine. shoulder jaw wrists and other joints can be affected with oa but its unusual. its often the result of excess mechanical forces on these joints. but genetics and inflammation play a role. pain stiffness and swelling of oa resolve with rest applying heat or cold to the joint and weight loss if needed. medications can also help reduce painful oa symptoms and joint inflammation and destruction. osteoarthritis most often occurs in the hands (at the ends of the fingers and thumbs) spine (neck and lower back) knees and hips.
since you work for a company providing health benefits the affordable care act will likely have no impact on you. most americans get their insurance through work or through some form of public insurance such as medicare. if you already have one of these types of coverage you need not take any action and can continue with the insurance benefits you already have.

first i'm sorry to hear you have been diagnosed with human papillomavirus (hpv) but i'm glad to hear you're getting regular pap smears. unfortunately your partner may already be infected. even without external genital warts or other symptoms you can spread the virus through mere contact during sexual intercourse. and use of a condom isn't necessarily protective either since a condom doesn't cover all the skin areas that may come in contact with the virus. the good news is that serious complications or cancers from hpv in heterosexual men with healthy immune systems is rare. in fact in both your cases the virus may clear up on its own over the course of a couple of years. (though this is less likely if you're passing it back and forth. ) both you and your boyfriend should be alert for signs of genital warts on his penis or scrotum. if you notice anything resembling genital warts he should try to see a doctor for a diagnosis. really the only way to diagnose hpv in men is through physical examination during an outbreak of the warts. if you have additional questions about this don't hesitate to ask your gynecologist. hpv is incredibly common. it's estimated that up to % of sexually active men and women will contract hpv at some point in their lives. take care!

not if you are in a cast. it would become so stinky that you could not stand the smell and the humidity has the potential of fostering a very itchy and irritating fungal infection. if you do not have any medical issues that would preclude you from using a sauna or steam room and you are in a boot instead of a cast hobble or hop in carefully (don't slip or fall) consider leaving the boot outside the room and enjoy. there are no reasons a person with a broken ankle cannot have a sauna or steam.

i would say no it's generally not harmful to become sexually aroused without orgasm. many woman have trouble reaching orgasm even those who take no medications at all. i'm not actually aware of any medications that block female orgasm so i wouldn't be too sure your inability to climax is related to a particular medication. of course if you have a heart condition you should be cleared by your physician for sexual activity. sexual arousal can raise blood pressure which can be bad for your heart if you have existing heart disease. if you have concerns about your sexual health please do not be reluctant to discuss them with your health care provider or a counselor with expertise in these issues. i can assure you any health care professional worth his or her salt will treat your concerns and questions with the respect and dignity they deserve. hope this helps!
"when you look at your eyes in the mirror you see three basic colors: the white of your eyeball the colored part of the iris and the black of the pupil. let's look at these in a little more detail. everyone's eyeball is white. it's just how they're made. everyone's pupil is black because the pupil is actually an opening that allows light to go inside the eyeball. the pupil looks black because there's no light inside the eye to illuminate it. if there were the pupil might look bright white or even orange as if it were glowing. wouldn't that be cool? the iris is the colored part of the eyeball. the iris is not a muscle but it does expand and contract to control the size of your pupil (and by extension how much light gets inside your eye). the color of your iris is genetically determined. genetics is complex business so i won't go into it here. suffice it to say you can't use any product to lighten darken or otherwise change the color of your iris. the color is ""hard-coded"" into your dna. if you are unhappy with the color of your eyes the only way to change it is with contact lenses. that said i would tell you not to obsess over your eye color. there's no such thing as ""too dark"" or ""too light. "" beauty is in the eye of the beholder (pun intended). try to love your eye color because it is absolutely unique in the universe. wishing you well!"

unfortunately you're not alone. my last colonoscopy and endoscopy i was wide awake and felt everything it wasn't fun to say the least! i recently had a endoscopy and the nurse said a few of the other nurses had the procedure without any meds. she also stated they have patients who've requested no medication! it was very uncomfortable to say the least. i'm on a fentanyl patch so it's very hard to sedate me.

"" irritability. muscle tension. headaches. sweating. difficulty concentrating. nausea. the need to go to the bathroom frequently. tiredness. trouble falling or staying asleep. trembling. being easily startled. in addition people with gad often have other anxiety disorders (such as panic disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder and phobias ) suffer from depression and/or abuse drugs or alcohol."
that would depend on the location of the herniated disk. if it was in lumbar area then this would be possible. if the disk was in your neck then. no. in my situation i have a herniated disk that is touching my sciatic nerve which is causing severe lower back pain that radiates down my buttocks leg and foot. the only relief i have is sitting down. standing walking or laying flat causes the disc to push against the sciatic nerve and sitting releases the pressure. so yes a herniated disc can radiate down the leg and butt.

while any of the stimulant medications can increase depressive symptoms. it's important to pay attention to this change in your son's mood and take him to a mental health professional for an assessment. children diagnosed with attention deficit/hyperactivitydisorder (adhd) at early are more likely to suffer from depression as adolescents than those who did not have adhd according to a long-term study published in the october issue of the archives of general psychiatry. although it was an uncommon occurrence the children with adhd also were somewhat more likely to think about or attempt suicide as adolescents. the study performed by researchers at the university of chicago and the university of pittsburgh followed  children diagnosed with adhd at age  to  for up to  years until they reached ages  to . it compared them with  children from similar neighborhoods and schools matched for age sex and ethnicity. the researchers found that  percent of children diagnosed early with adhd suffered from depression as adolescents about  times the rate among those without adhd. children with early adhd were five times as likely to have considered suicide at least once and twice as likely to have made an attempt. please get your son evaluated.
"poison ivy (or oak) is caused by exposure to the olioresin (oil) of the plant. it does not come back in the same place two months later unless you were re-exposed to the oil again. the oil can remain stable on an object for years so you don't have to come in contact with plant. just an object that still has the oil on it. please be sure you actually have poison ivy. many skin eruptions can mimic this allergic disorder and some can even show up in the same place (like eczema shingles etc. ). so i see that some people insist poison ivy cannot return months later and others say it can. and who is right? absolutely the people who say it can return are right. last summer i had poison ivy around my ankles. many months later in the winter a milder version of the rash returned. i was not wearing the same clothes not sleeping on the same sheets and not touching anything i had used outdoors. i was not working outdoors at all! moreover even now a year later though i don't have the rash around my ankles if i scratch my skin in that area the red bumps and the itching will return. currently i am recovering from poison ivy rash primarily on my face and neck--unrelated to last year's episode. i have taken prednizone for a week (and never again will i take a stereoid! no wonder all those nfl players are killing people). i have washed all my clothes sheets etc. in hot water twice. the rash on my face has almost disappeared but i have little outbreaks here and there in odd places like a bump on my arm or on my back. but i have not worked outdoors in more than  weeks. the poison ivy--as someone else said--is surely in my system. i wish i could prove it so that people like me tormented by this vicious plant wouldn't look for answers and receive erroneous ones from so-called professionals. what has worked better for me than anything is white vinegar. it stings on the bumps and openings in the skin but the stinging is not worse than the itching. i apply it liberally with drenched cottonballs until my skin is dripping and i wait for it to dry naturally. then i rub ""itch"" all over the now-dry area. there may be better methods but the vinegar dries it out makes thick scabs (hideous but effective) the scabs fall off fairly soon (so thick they make a plopping sound when they fall! ugh! gross! ). i've been able to sleep with this method maybe having to get up once in the night to reapply the vinegar or just grope for the itch and rub some in--whereas last year using other treatments i could not sleep. other ""treatments""--vick's vapo-rub clorox (so good for your liver) cortizone creams and other over-the-counter meds have not done so well. haven't tried tobacco but i'm an x-smoker and if there's anything that makes me want to smoke it's lying awake all night scratching--so i had to forget that. a pox take the next creep who writes that ""the best treatment is avoidance. "" (i hope you get to dance to the tune of poison ivy at least once. the plant is everywhere! ) i hope this helps some other poor sufferer! itchy-scratchy yes the rash can return to same area months later. once you have been exposed to this plant and even thought the rash itself may have long since healed or faded away the underlying skin proteins remain sensitized to urushiol for quite some time in some cases several years hence the slightest newest recent exposure to urushiol in certain individuals will cause you to experience for a second or third time a newer rash. breathing in the flower pollen also in certain individuals will cause them to develop a rash. exposure frequency and time interval duration between each successive pi exposure to a large extent will determine how severe your rash outbreak will not only be but how long it will last. ""it's in the blood"" is what i have grown up hearing about poison oak once you have gotten it on you. always thought that statement was crazy until  years ago i accidently got it on me. the rash has come up every year without fail in the same exact spot even when i have avoided the outdoors pets and all clothing and bedding washed repeatedly. tried just about every home grown or over the counter cure possible. usually just have to keep the area clean and wait it out. the most horrid plant in the universe! i have had symptoms of poison ivy rash which was initially on undersides of arms and on front of shins. now over most of my body. after two  day treatments of  steroids a day and steroid cream it is worse than ever (during steroid treatments it started to fade but came back with a vengence when the pills stopped). desperate now with itching awful looking skin. have left the gym (which had helped me lose  stone in  months). hate going as whether you are working out or swimming people quite naturally look at your skin. i am now to see a dermatologist on tuesday so can only hope something can be improved. best cooling lotions i have used for relief of itching have been aloe vera and (one i got in the us) called caladryl clear (topical analgesic skin protectant). coated in this after cold water or ice to skin seems to make me more comfortable. i got this in june and it is now nearly september. worst thing i have ever managed to get. deeply regret doing all that gardening now and still haven't found the pouson ivy."

the first step is to prevent yourself from acting out during anger episodes. while getting angry either do reverse counting from  to  or deep breathing. after calming down give logical suggestions to yourself against losing temper in that particular situation. log down the events resulting in stress and weekly review them. then think some alternative response from your side to resolve it. practice relaxation exercises like yoga (pranayama). follow steps of sleep hygiene such as avoiding caffeinated drinks. remember that every problem has a solution. you just need to try solving it. for further information consult a psychiatrist online --> <link>

i have delt with bi-polar disorder my entire life. my mom was severely bi-polar and i was diagnosed at age . my mother attempted suicide over  times. i have one brother and two sisters who refused to deal with my mom due to the fact they thought her suicide attempts were just ways to get attention. my mother passed away in . non-suicide. so now i am basically on my own with this disorder as my siblings not really wanting to have anything to do with me because they couldn't deal with my mothers bi-polar. i realize this is off topic but i would like to thank  for her earlier response. i experience alot of the same symptoms she does and until i read her response i thought it was just me. thanks for being so open and honest. as far as the main topic the illnesses or other symptoms you might have due to your bi-polar vary from person to person. aches pains headaches migraine. the list can go on and on.

yes you can re-break an arm but it will take an x-ray and a careful examination to make that determination. the fact that your arm is hurting more and more each day is an indication that you need to seek hands-on medical care. while there are many other non-fracture reasons for arm pain these cannot be sorted out blindly over the internet.

the types of arrhythmias include: premature atrial contractions. these are early extra beats that originate in the atria (upper chambers of the heart). they are harmless and generally do not require treatment. premature ventricular contractions (pvcs). these are among the most common arrhythmias and occur in people with or without heart disease. this is the skipped heartbeat we all occasionally experience. in some people it can be related to stress too much caffeine or nicotine or too much exercise. but sometimes pvcs can be caused by heart disease or electrolyte imbalance. people who have a lot of pvcs and/or symptoms associated with them should be evaluated by a heart doctor. however in most people pvcs are usually harmless and rarely need treatment. atrial fibrillation. atrial fibrillation is a very common irregular heart rhythm that causes the atria the upper chambers of the heart to contract abnormally. atrial flutter. this is an arrhythmia caused by one or more rapid circuits in the atrium. atrial flutter is usually more organized and regular than atrial fibrillation. this arrhythmia occurs most often in people with heart disease and in the first week after heart surgery. it often converts to atrial fibrillation. paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (psvt). a rapid heart rate usually with a regular rhythm originating from above the ventricles. psvt begins and ends suddenly. there are two main types: accessory path tachycardias and av nodal reentrant tachycardias (see below). accessory pathway tachycardias. a rapid heart rate due to an extra abnormal pathway or connection between the atria and the ventricles. the impulses travel through the extra pathways as well as through the usual route. this allows the impulses to travel around the heart very quickly causing the heart to beat unusually fast. av nodal reentrant tachycardia. a rapid heart rate due to more than one pathway through the av node. it can cause heart palpitations fainting or heart failure. in some cases it can be terminated using simple maneuvers such as breathing in and bearing down. some drugs can also stop this heart rhythm. ventricular tachycardia (v-tach). a rapid heart rhythm originating from the lower chambers (or ventricles) of the heart. the rapid rate prevents the heart from filling adequately with blood. this can be a serious arrhythmia especially in people with heart disease and may be associated with more symptoms. ventricular fibrillation. an erratic disorganized firing of impulses from the ventricles. the ventricles quiver and are unable to contract or pump blood to the body. this is a medical emergency that must be treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr) and defibrillation as soon as possible. long qt syndrome. the qt interval is the area on the electrocardiogram that represents the time it takes for the heart muscle to contract and then recover or for the electrical impulse to fire impulses and then recharge. when the qt interval is longer than normal it increases the risk of a life-threatening form of ventricular tachycardia. long qt syndrome is an inherited condition that can cause sudden death in young people. it can be treated with antiarrhythmic drugs pacemaker electrical cardioversion defibrillation implanted cardioverter/defibrillator or ablation therapy. bradyarrhythmias. these are slow heart rhythms which may arise from disease in the heart's electrical conduction system. examples include sinus node dysfunction and heart block. sinus node dysfunction. a slow heart rhythm due to an abnormal sinus node. significant sinus node dysfunction that causes symptoms is treated with a pacemaker. heart block. a delay or complete block of the electrical impulse as it travels from the sinus node to the ventricles. the heart may beat irregularly and often more slowly. if serious heart block is treated with a pacemaker.
in my opinion this looks like a dermatitis due to the sessions you are getting to remove it. try antihistaminic otc and topical steroids to treat it. does not seem like scar.

if you're unemployed and can't find a health plan that you can afford (one that costs no more than % of your income) you will be exempt. however the good news is that as someone without an income you'll qualify for steep subsidies to dramatically lower the cost of insurance. and if you live in a state expanding its medicaid program you may qualify for that as well which will provide you with insurance at no cost.
"if you have no income or very low income you may not have to pay the penalty under the aca. the law includes a so-called ""hardship exemption"" for people who cannot afford the coverage available to them. but be sure to check the specific rules at www. healthcare. gov. and remember if you do get a new job or your income rises during the year for another reason you may no longer be exempt from the penalty. if you do have no income now or very low income you should also check out your state's medicaid coverage option. you may be eligible for coverage there with little or no cost."

how do you know your partner doesn't have it? did he tell you? some cases of herpes can so minor that a person may misdiagnose themselves as just having a rash or irritation. genital herpes is sexually-transmitted in . % of the cases and a person does not have to be actively infected at the time to pass it on. it is very difficult to know the exact type of herpes so oral herpes (fever blisters cold sores) can be transmitted to the genital area during oral sex. if you have only had one partner then the source is likely that one partner. if you have had more than one then it could have been any of them.
yes some people carry the virus and don't even know until the first outbreak but when the outbreak occurs you'll know for sure its nothing like a cold sore. i get cold sores btw they are not herpes technically but my father has herpes and his sores are painful big blisters not just on the mouth but genitals too. if you do have the virus it will usually show during great times of stress. that's how my dads works anyways. hope i helped!
asthma and copd are two diseases that lead to airflow obstruction. asthma is typically characterized by reversible airflow obstruction meaning the obstruction comes and goes. this is why asthmatics have varying symptoms. in contrast copd patients have chronic airflow obstruction. for some patients with asthma they can develop airway remodelling and persistent obstruction that looks similiar to copd on breathing tests. that's not exactly happen but person with copd could suffer from asthma.
when you see a doctor about acne you'll have a physical exam and your doctor will ask about your medical history. women may be asked questions about their menstrual cycles. this information can help your doctor find out if hormones are playing a role in acne flare-ups. most often you won't have any special tests to diagnose acne. you may need other tests if your doctor suspects that acne is a symptom of another medical problem (such as higher-than-normal amounts of testosterone in a woman). webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.
"bipolar disorder is a mental illness that causes dramatic shifts in mood inciting episodes of both mania and depression. during the ""manic"" episodes patients swing into an unrealistically ""high"" state of mind and momentarily lose touch with some realities. on the extreme end they may believe they have super powers or to a lesser extent shop vicariously for expensive items them don't need and usually can't afford. these episodes alternate with a depressive state. during this period there is a lack of energy irritability sadness and a feeling of hopelessness. in between there are can be periods where the patient seems normal balanced and in control. a small percentage of bipolar patients do however experience chronic residual symptoms. the early designation for this condition was ""manic depression"". now it is called bipolar disorder to indicate polar opposites or again shifts in mood and perception."

expiration dates on products whether it is medication or food are printed on the package for a reason. it is to protect you from damaging your body (making you ill) and to let you know that the product will no longer be effective. we wouldn't drink milk that is  weeks past its expiration so why would you want to take advil  weeks past the expiration? advil is used to treat pain fever and inflammation. you would not want to extend your symptoms due to taking an expired ineffective product. nor would you want to guess at how many tablets you have to take to get an effective dose increasing the possibility of toxicity and side effects. this is not a gray situation. it is black and white. either the medication is safe to take or not. if the medication has expired please do not ingest it. instead work with your pharmacy or local police department on how to dispose of expired medication.

i know a man who told me his wife died from shingles. i think he is a carrier even though he does not have the symptoms? because after cleaning his house for him and spending a few hours talking with him and using his dishes i developed a single shingle on my hand and two on the top of my upper lip. now i have never had herpes or fever blisters or cold sores. ever. my family members were afflicted but i never was infected. i freaked out and treated the sores with a variety of things to get it to go away before it spread. i used colloidal silver for one. both topically and orally. i used a baking soda paste. i used essential oils oregano and peppermint. i finally also used organic apple cider vinegar and the one on my hand has disappeared. the ones on the lip were gone in four days. the one on my hand had lasted two weeks. i think you can catch it from someone. my husband had it when i was pregnant with my son in  and i never got it. i have had chickenpox a mild case when i was a little one. i think this is a nervous reaction in the body to stressors that one has not release from. you can die from it. it seems more serious to me than they make it out to be. and it some cases it is contagious.

"us women. our bodies can be so unpredictable. no two alike! you don't say how old you are but it sounds like you've had your period for awhile. if this discharge you describe has ""always"" happened then rest assured it's normal. it's probably some mucus being discharged in the final stage of your period. if this discharge is ""new "" as in it started happening just recently then it might be worth asking a gynecologist about it. any time a person develops a new symptom -- whether it's tingling in a finger or discharge from the vagina -- it's good to get a medical opinion. in all likelihood there's nothing wrong. but why not get an expert's advice? wishing you well!"

nighttime heartburn tends to leave acid in the esophagus longer and therefore may cause more damage than daytime heartburn. nighttime heartburn can also result in chronic insomnia. many people can find relief by: avoiding foods that can lead to heartburn such as alcohol chocolate and spicy or fatty foods. not eating anything for two to three hours before bedtime. chewing gum in the evening to boost saliva. putting blocks under the top of the mattress to elevate the head four to six inches. taking antacids which neutralize the acid in the stomach;  receptor antagonists which reduce the production of acid by the stomach; or a proton pump inhibitor.

"drug metabolism is the process by which the body breaks down medications. the liver plays a major role in metabolism especially a group of enzymes known as cytochrome p-. drug interactions can occur when two or more drugs inhibit or induce a p- reaction and the drugs do not metabolize as quickly as they should. nicotine is a ""drug"" also and is known to induce the p- system. individuals with liver disease may also have insufficient levels of p- enzymes. the result is that drug levels can remain high in the bloodstream and cause more side effects. genetic factors also play a role in drug metabolism. the metabolic rate can vary significantly from person to person and drug dosages that work quickly and effectively in one individual may not work well for another or cause build-up and more side effects. infants and elderly patients have a reduced abilty to metabolize certain drugs so we often adjust their med dosage. but we find that people with fm  seem to act like ""geriatric patients"" in terms of sensitivity to meds and side effects (and metabolism? ) and often require lower doses than the ""normal"" non-fm adult. certain foods such as grapefruit juice and certain meds taken on an occasional basis can inactivate or lessen the metabolic activity of p- and can cause apparent fluctuations in response/tolerence to regular prescribed meds. we with fibro always seem to develop tolerances and intolerances to meds that we previously did well with which is frustrating to say the least. so there are different metabolism tolerance and intolerance factors that can cause us to have ""reactions"" to our meds. ."
doctors arent sure but they believe that certain individuals have immune systems that are more able to fight off the viruses and prevent warts from growing. also just as some people are more likely to get poison ivy the genetic makeups and immune systems of certain individuals make them more susceptible to the viruses that cause skin warts. it is also common to see warts on multiple siblings in the same family. and children of people who had skin warts as children are often quite susceptible to skin warts themselves says robert brodell md a dermatologist in warren ohio. still experts have yet to determine exactly what is different in the immune systems of people who get skin warts frequently.
a doctors office may or may not have met the standards. it may or may not have been accredited or certified. it is possible to have an operation done in a doctors office that has not passed the test. not a good idea because when youve passed the test and you have the stamp of approval by the same accrediting organization often that accredits hospitals theyve given it the stamp of approval because youve got the right equipment there and also the center follows safe orthodox procedures everything from hiring practices meaning they dont hire just anybody off the street. for the nursing staff they have to be experienced have the right credentials to they have to have good infection control programs. in other words theres no b level standard if youre accredited its all a. but what if the doctor has chosen not to pursue that course. he can still do a procedure in his office because the law doesnt require that surgery be done in a licensed facility. i mean theoretically you could do it in a  foot trailer if you wanted to. it doesnt happen that way because the ride is a little bumpy but the reality is that these are the important questions that one should ask and should have very clear answers to before proceeding. you want to know that you are in a safe environment
one of the things that you mentioned is the fact that this patient stated that they were taking it  minutes before. i will say they could consider taking it  minutes that extra time actually decrease the bloating and the abdominal cramping. however these are common side-effects with carafate. we probably would refer them back to their physician because carafate is used in the treatment of healing an ulcer it forms like a band-aid over it. so it protects your stomach lining from food and acid. if the ulcer is pretty much healed there is a possibility that the patient may not need to take the medication anymore or we need to find that out and refer them back to the physician or healthcare provider to find that out.

under-eye circles are due to a combination of factors -- genetics allergies rubbing stress lack of sleep dehydration leftover makeup. look for products that contain peptides sepi-white caffeine niacinamide mulberry root extract or retinoids. chin firming creams should contain retinoids peptides hyaluronic acid growth factors. speak with your dermatologist or plastic surgeon to see if a radio frequency procedure such as thermage is appropriate for you. the results in the chin area can be dramatic.
these medications have minor drug interactions that i am sure your physician is monitoring. it is safe to take these medications together and i have seen this combination many times. dilantin can decrease the concentrations of geodon. this may explain why a higher dose is being used in your situation. remember all of the medications can cause dizziness drowsiness and may impair your normal functioning causing an additive effect. just limit your activities until you are better accustomed to the side effects or until the side effects begin to decrease. work with your pharmacist and health care provider especially if the side effects are too much for you.
since there is generally no heat involved in the pickling process it doesnt significantly change the nutritional value of foods. this is particularly true if you start with raw veggies and keep the skin on since the skin often carries much of the nutritional value including the fiber. the fermentation process involved in pickling may even produce some health benefits since the healthy bacteria (probiotics) involved in the process can help keep your digestive system healthy. one possible nutritional downfall of pickling is the addition of salt which is key to the process. for that reason pickled beets and other vegetables are a good option to enjoy from time to time. but you dont want to make them your go-to sources of veggies.

large cysts and solid masses are usually removed surgically because:pain and risk of infection associated with ovarian torsion cysts may leak with the leaked fluid causing pain so large cysts with demonstrable leaked fluid in the abdomen may require surgery solid masses are never normal and require surgical exploration a large ovarian mass will pull on pelvic ligaments and make it likely that the ovary will become twisted (called torsion) — which is very painful. other than the normal process of recovering from surgery removing a cyst while leaving the ovary intact should cause no noticeable effect.

although research suggests that people who stop exercising gain more weight over time than people who stay active everyone is different. exercise especially the type that strengthens the body helps build muscle which weighs more than fat. after exercise is stopped there is some lean tissue loss. people who stop exercising also tend to eat the same (or more) calories resulting in eventual weight gain. but you might be different and actually eat less which could be another reason you lose weight. i always recommend exercise for people who want to gain weight i n a healthy way. because exercise is healthy and keeps weight on you it makes sense to keep it up. best of health to you!

i'm sorry you're going through this. i can certainly understand your wanting a more permanent solution to the problem after dealing with the support hose for five years. certainly there are surgical procedures to treat varicose veins. i'm not sure why your health care provider didn't recommend any of them when you were first diagnosed. after five years you may feel free to return to your provider and ask about more permanent options for your condition. there may be a very good reason why you weren't offered surgery to begin with. maybe it wasn't feasible for some reason. but surgical techniques change and patients change. maybe today you're a better candidate for surgery than you were five years ago. the only way to find out is to see a medical professional. you can start with your primary care provider or go directly to a physician who specializes in varicose vein treatments. hope this helps!

"one of your questions is "" are these (symptoms) just the effects of stress? "" i don't think that they are just stress related. you are also not ""crazy"" as suggested in your post. schizophrenic individuals for example feel that their hallucinations are real while you definitely live in a state of reality in being aware that you are daydreaming. maladaptive daydreaming (preoccupation with daydreaming where large blocks of daily time are spent fantasying) ) is not well understood by many medical professionals. its cause is unknown. some of your symptoms like feeling paranoid intense and complex daydreaming (can be so realistic that its as though you're reading a novel) and feeling anxious can all be related to the one disorder maladaptive daydreaming. here's what you can do: look for triggers that may set of the daydreaming episodes. some activities like playing video games may activate the daydreaming and oftentimes associated fantasies; be good to yourself and realize that you'll have good and bad days with mdd. look for positive ways to plan and spend your time and divert your actions away from daydreaming; find a physician that thoroughly understands maladaptive daydreaming and follow their treatment directions. with talk therapy and medications you can decrease these unwanted chucks of wasted time being taken away from what should be a productive day. i am optimistic about your future."

hi the intense back pain and pelvic pressure you are experiencing is due to the increase in the size of the baby now as it has almost attained its full growth. this causes pressure and stretching of the sacroiliac joints causing severe pain. u can apply local creams hot fomentation. avoid taking any tablets. consult a gynecologist if the pain is severe. the urine colour u mentioned may be due to slight vaginal discharge that gets mixed with urine. nothing to worry about until you can feel the baby movements. thanks
this is a great way to help a child with congestion and i recommend this all the time. thanks for submitting a question today.
this is a great question and i'm glad you asked it. not all medications are effective if dissolved in a liquid. i'd suggest you check with the child's doctor or pharmacist to learn if this technique is appropriate with the medication in question. meanwhile i'd recommend dissolving the medication in the smallest amount of liquid possible and having the child drink it all at once. for example if you could dissolve the medication in an ounce or two of cola you could reward her with the remainder of the can after she drinks the portion containing the medicine. dissolving the medication in a small amount of fluid will create a higher concentration of it in the mixture so that when she takes it she'll get something close to the full dose. i hope this helps!

ouch! having both elbows injured at the same time can't be fun! the bottom line is this: if you're concerned about your elbow not feeling better after  weeks then there's nothing wrong with going back to the doctor and having it re-examined. if nothing else it will give you peace of mind. it's possible the elbow that wasn't x-rayed sustained a soft tissue injury. these can be very painful and slow to heal. it sounds like you have full range of motion with that elbow which is good. in other words you can bend it fully. that's always a good sign. still when in doubt check it out. you can start with your primary care provider. he or she will take an x-ray if needed and hopefully get you on the path to being pain-free. good luck!

"some women don't tell anyone about their symptoms because they feel embarrassed ashamed or guilty about feeling depressed when they are supposed to be happy. they worry that they will be viewed as unfit parents. perinatal depression can happen to any woman. it does not mean you are a bad or ""not-together"" mom. you and your baby don't have to suffer. there is help. there are different types of individual and group ""talk therapies"" that can help a woman with perinatal depression feel better and do better as a mom and as a person. limited research suggests that many women with perinatal depression improve when treated with antidepressant medicine. your doctor can help you learn more about these options and decide which approach is best for you and your baby. speak to your doctor or midwife if you are having symptoms of depression while you are pregnant or after you deliver your baby. your doctor or midwife can give you a questionnaire to test for depression and can also refer you to a mental health professional who specializes in treating depression. here are some other helpful tips: try to get as much rest as you can. try to nap when the baby naps. stop putting pressure on yourself to do everything. do as much as you can and leave the rest. ask for help with household chores and nighttime feedings. ask your husband or partner to bring the baby to you so you can breastfeed. if you can have a friend family member or professional support person help you in the home for part of the day. talk to your husband partner family and friends about how you are feeling. do not spend a lot of time alone. get dressed and leave the house. run an errand or take a short walk. spend time alone with your husband or partner. talk with other mothers so you can learn from their experiences. join a support group for women with depression. call a local hotline or look in your telephone book for information and services. don't make any major life changes during pregnancy. major changes can cause unneeded stress. sometimes big changes cannot be avoided. when that happens try to arrange support and help in your new situation ahead of time."
if your goal is to eliminate your migraines by having a hysterectomy i have bad news for you. while female hormones may play a role in migraines this link hasn't been firmly established. many women who have had hysterectomies have migraines. to answer the other part of your question having a hysterectomy will remove your uterus so you won't have a period anymore. however if you leave the ovaries intact you will still have a hormonal cycle. in other words you may still notice changes in your mood on a monthly basis as long as your ovaries are producing estrogen. if you have your uterus and your ovaries removed you will go into surgical menopause. the symptoms of this are the same as regular menopause so some women opt to go on hormone replacement therapy to ease symptoms like hot flashes and trouble sleeping. i urge you to discuss your migraines with your health care provider. treatments for migraine continue to evolve. maybe your doctor can help you find a medication or other therapy that relieves your headaches. hope this helps!

hi it would have been nice to know how long between your last bout and this new one or is just a carryover. chronic prostatitis – the most common type. symptoms will have lasted for at least three months although they may come and go and vary in severity. the cause isn't always clear. acute prostatitis – symptoms are severe and develop rapidly. this is caused by a bacterial infection of the prostate gland. it's a medical emergency as without prompt treatment with antibiotics the prostate and surrounding areas can become damaged. an estimated one in every   men will develop acute prostatitis. is it either of the two above if so get back for more treatment. do hope this helps. good luck
yes but polysporin would not be very effective for acne. talk to your medical provider since there are more effective topical medications that can be used. the flair up of your acne is most likely your hormones. soon. after your baby is born those hormones will settle down again. best of luck with your baby!

"""baby blues are very normal and very common. having a baby even if it's a second or third baby is a sea of change in your life "" says catherine monk phd herbert irving assistant professor of clinical psychology in the departments of psychiatry and obstetrics at columbia university college of physicians and surgeons. ""that combined with the fluctuating hormones as your body goes from being pregnant to not pregnant can lead to major mood swings. "" experts say there are two big differences between baby blues and true postpartum depression: how long your depressed feelings last. how intense the feelings are. the baby blues usually begin a few days after delivery and last about  days to two weeks. the baby blues also feel different than postpartum depression. ""they're not just about being sad. baby blues seem to be about being full of feeling "" explains nada stotland md mph professor of psychiatry and obstetrics and gynecology at rush medical college in chicago."
"i think you have a right to express your preference when it comes to medical management but you cannot force an insurance company to automatically accept those preferences. i don't know your particular case but you can get second opinions outside of your hmo if you are not comfortable what your health plan is proposing. it seems that that people who ""pay the bills"" are the one's that tend to ""call the shots"" but you do have rights to question those decisions."
i wouldn't describe the aca as a one-size fits all but it does create a minimum set of benefits that all plans in the individual and small employer market must cover (note: nearly all large employer plans already cover these benefits). previously most plans in the individual market did not offer very comprehensive coverage and had a number of exclusions (e. g. maternity mental health coverage even cancer treatments). the idea behind insurance is that it is spreading risk across a large group of people. at any point in time many people will be healthy and won't need to go to the doctor.
i am so so excited to share this testimony with everyone. i never really believed in spell casting nor magic whatsoever. i was so ignorant of the fact that one can really get pregnant by any means of spell casting. i am from philippines i am happily married with a new born baby(boy). i am  years old. i got married to my husband  ago and since then we have been battling with a problem of getting an issue. i was so frustrated as my husband threatened me of getting a new wife and his family members also threatened that i will be thrown out of the house. i looked for means everywhere but ought to no avail. to cut the long story short i contacted priest babaka the spell caster and today i am proud to say that i am a mother with the help of priest babaka. contact him now and get yours solved via his email: babaka. wolf@gmail. com

"no one can be adequately diagnosed over the internet based solely on a description. you will need to be examined by a medical provider since there can be sooooo many reasons. it is possible that not all of your symptoms are ""connected"" (a person can have more than one medical issue at the same time). you may need a strep test for your throat. or even a test for mononucleosis but a medical provider would need to make that decision based on your examination findings."
studies have shown ultrasound is not hazardous. there are no harmful side effects to you or your baby. in addition ultrasound does not use radiation as x-ray tests do.
amoxicillin does not cause pink eye. the standard treatment of pink eye (conjunctivitis) is with a prescription antibiotic drop or ointment. you will need to call your medical provider (the one that treated your ear infection) and ask for a prescription to be called in. you should not need to have another medical examination in most cases.
i would say whichever you feel you can do most successfully. smoking is a huge health risk factor and can affect blood sugar levels. if you choose to do that first which makes a lot of sense you can still make small changes to your diet while taking medication. for example eating at the right times to coincide with medication and checking blood sugar can be a good first step while you kick the smoking habit. once your smoking habit is under control you can dive deeper into diet and exercise. but the key is starting somewhere and taking it one small step at a time. good luck! see more. smoking cessation health center a healthy type  diabetes diet
it would be better if it is done with ultrasound guidance but its not compulsory. depending on the painful part the injection can be given

"clostridium difficile (or c. diff ) is a bacterium that lives naturally in the human gut. however usually when people refer to "" c. diff "" they're referring to c. diff colitis which is an infectious diarrhea caused when c. diff bacteria grow unchecked. the most common cause of c. diff colitis is disruption of the normal balance of bacteria in the gut due to taking antibiotics. it's important to understand c. diff is highly contagious. it spreads through direct contact. so if a person has c. diff diarrhea and soils the bedding which then touches the nightstand as you're taking the sheets off the bed you can pick up the c. diff bacteria from the nightstand and become infected yourself. c. diff colitis is a nasty condition. it's painful and annoying (all those bathroom trips). beyond the annoyance it can cause life-threatening dehydration in children and the elderly. any time a person gets diarrhea that persists after finishing a course of antibiotics they should consult their medical provider to determine if they have a case of c. diff. c. diff usually is treated with one or more courses of oral antibiotics. other therapies may include fluids (to avoid dehydration) and probiotic supplements to help restore the balance of flora in the gut. if you suspect you or a loved one has c. diff colitis it's imperative you avoid spreading it. you must use alcohol-based hand rub every time you go to the bathroom or have contact with a person who has c. diff. washing your hands with soap and water will not kill this bacterium. wear medical gloves when dealing with soiled linen -- and also use hand rub. you also need to wash bedding towels and even clothing in hot water preferably with chlorine bleach. i sincerely hope neither you nor a loved one ever has to experience a c. diff infection. wishing you well!"
what are your symptoms? i have been bloated and burping for two months. i am nauseous too though. my sister and i are looking into our hormone levels. we found that melatonin is a hormone in your body and changes all the time like insulin levels. in the winter with lack of sunlight melatonin levels can be high and stay in the gut creating high acid levels in the stomach. we are trying full spectrum light therpy. i have a co-worker too who says he is bloated and always feels full right now. i do not feel depressed or anything but maybe it is sad (seasonal affective disorder).

because it doesn't work. valtrex only works for herpes viruses; mono is caused by the ebv virus.
not really but if your sensitivity to egg whites is not severe (like anaphylaxis) it could be fine. get a blood test for egg-white allergy (rast testing) to see how severe your allergic response might be. if your medical provider feels it is safe based on this test have the flu vaccine administered at a medical facility under the care of a allergy specialist in the event of an adverse reaction.
there are no studies that link nicotine gum to throat cancer otherwise it would not be on the market. nicotine via cigarettes are another story entirely. it is other cancer-causing chemicals in tobacco (and there are many) that have been linked not the nicotine.

"of course you may be serviced at an urgent care clinic but i don't see that as being your best choice. urgent care center doctors see individuals for relatively uncomplicated matters that can be resolved in one visit. conditions such as colds viruses rashes minor injuries bruises cuts requiring stiches and infections are typical types of straight forward easily diagnosable cases that respond well to immediate treatment. a migraine headache is a symptom of some other disorder within the body such as hormonal changes head/neck injury alcohol consumption sexual activity eye conditions ears nose & throat disorders emotional stress ingesting certain foods and beverages environmental factors such as breathing polluted air and many other reasons. there is also a relationship between family heredity as a predisposing factor seen in suffers with migraines. i recommend that you begin your search for resolution by making an appointment with a migraine headache specialist. other doctors who may provide you with answers to your headaches include: neurologists pain management specialists ob/gyn specialists endocrinologists and allergy specialists. the next task is to begin keeping a journal of all daily activates. it should include times dates all physical and emotional events all foods and beverages consumed and of course headaches. note the start and end times for all headaches the quality of the headache (what does it feel like? ) your pain level ( - ) treatments attempted and your response to those treatments. if the headaches cannot be reduced in their number of episodes or their intensity in a reasonable amount of time then going to a hospital emergency room or urgent care center is justified. in the interim take the medications as instructed maintain a quiet and dark environment during acute headache periods apply a facial ice pack/and or heat to the painful areas eat and drink nutritious meals and rest as needed. unfortunately migraine headaches are painful and may be difficult to diagnosis in the differential process of identifying the precipitating factors known (""triggers"") which are unique to the individual sufferer of a migraine headache. feel better soon."
most individuals with athlete's foot have no symptoms at all and do not even know they have an infection. many may think they simply have dry skin on the soles of their feet. common symptoms of athlete's foot typically include various degrees of itching and burning. the skin may frequently peel and in particularly severe cases there may be some cracking pain and bleeding as well. rarely athlete's foot can blister (called bullous tinea pedis).

"skin tags are often referred to as ""inflammatory tags"" since they are often caused by repeated inflammation. some people are born with skin tags however. the often occur in the armpits from years of using underarm deodorant or shaving around areas where clothing may have rubbed around the anal area from a life of extensive paperwork. they can be annoying they can itch they can get infected and more importantly they can be easily removed. the most common method is a simple excision. once the area is properly numbed by lidocaine a medical provider may just painlessly snip them off with sterile scissors and cauterize the base to avoid bleeding. larger skin lesions (and you can form whoppers! ) may require a few little stitches to limit an ugly scar. they can be frozen off with liquid nitrogen and even pitched to death by using a hemostat. they can come back or new ones can form. since many skin lesions can mimic innocent skin tags it is best to have these office procedures done by a medical professional -- someone who will most likely send them off to the lab for proper pathological analysis."
sure. but that would depend on what you are soaking. salt in an open would certainly would not be pleasant. our bodies are composed of salt water so putting intact skin in salt water is like swimming in the ocean.
in my opinion the motorized toothbrushes really do help in plaque removal. i also love the water piks with diluted mouthwashes in them. however if cost is a factor a regular soft toothbrush and mouthwash will work.
probably not but it is good not to do this again if a perforated eardrum is even remotely possible.
techinically yes. since you still have a throat and perhaps even some tonsillar remnants that can harbor the strep bacteria. strep after a tonsillectomy is uncommon however.
"what kind of ear infection? the only one that may benefit from an injection of a potent steroid would be an inner ear infection (dizzy vertigo vomiting etc. ). cortisporin eardrops will only help otitis externa (swimmer's ear). since i don't know the reason for the steroid the type or severity of your ear infection ther is really no way to predict when (or even ""if"") this treatment will work."
"i tend to go with what the expert tells me whether it's an md or a quantum physicist because they have far greater training and expertise in their fields than i do. if your ob doc says it's ok for your wife to have caffeine sushi and a drink then i would tend to rely on that advice. however the larger issue here is: when is it appropriate to question a physician? the answer: anytime! it's not unusual to leave the doctor's office and later feel conflicted or unsettled by what you've been told. and it's perfectly fine to call your doctor's office back to express your conflicted feelings and ask for clarification. doctors don't mind this. at least good caring doctors don't. if you want to be perfectly safe your wife can err on the side of caution and avoid caffeine sushi and alcohol. just because the doctor said she ""could"" consume them doesn't mean she ""must"" consume them. make sense? best wishes with the pregnancy!"
diet is one component of slowing down kidney disease but so are regular visits to your doctor and taking prescribed medications. for example keeping blood sugar under control if you are diabetic will help your kidneys as will keeping blood pressure in normal range. that is a mix of diet and medications. it's also important for you to understand what you doctor or dietitian recommend in terms of protein potassium sodium fluid and phosphorous levels in your diet. recommendations will vary depending on whether or not you are on dialysis and your labs. make sure you have a good healthcare team to help you out. also see kidney disease: changing your diet good luck!

no the color of mucous does not automatically assume that something is viral bacterial or allergic. it is just a clue. in most cases green mucous is more likely to indicate stagnation (especially if the green is primarily in the mornings). just a like a pond that turns green when water is not flowing in and out the mucous can be green when you are chronically congested. you will need to be medically evaluated in order to determine if the green really has a bacterial association or is just plain 'ol stagnation.

the toilet seat is remotely possible but girls using the toilet typically do not have these parts directly touching the seat. if the herpetic lesions were on her buttocks or legs it would be more possible. you cannot get or transmit genital herpes by drinking or eating after someone. just direct contact. as long as she keeps her hands clean after using the toilet and of course keeps the bathroom toilet spotless you will be safe.

hi you are not alone. believe me. there are others dealing with the same issues. i had migraines for about a month. i could not eat because then i'd throw up could not be in the light could not even go outside. each and everytime that i went outside i'd throw up. the light bothered me and made my migraines worse as well as the noise and the tv. there are good meds out there on the market for that. you just have to experience with them to see which one helps you to the most. i too saw my neurologist for my migraines. he gave me a script but it did not help very much. (those migraines are a killer). i'd cry because i could not eat or keep anything down. it did started with an aura. and mind you. i was outside waiting on the metro rail stop when this happened. i sort of had a feeling like kind of oooze. so i called my dr. and he told me to get to the nearesr er. and they told me it was migraines. and i was just constantly throwing up left and right at the er.

go with her to her next doctor's appointment or inform the prescribing medical provider that she is addicted and abusing this dangerous narcotic. you are wise and caring for being concerned but only your wife can stop. have her seek help from a self-help -step program. if she is truly in pain seeing a pain specialist is the best way to go. her doctor can refer her. there is really no way for me or any medical provider to make blind pain medication suggestions since we do not know her particular case. she needs help and you can help her get this help.

if you are concerned about pregnancy this would be unlikely based on the information you have shared. as far as the post-coital bleeding is concerned i really can't comment since i do not know anything about you or your medical history. it would not be possible for me to blindly guess at the reason so please consult your medical provider if you are concerned or the bleeding persists. was this your first time? perhaps the bleeding occurred as a result of him bursting through your hymen as you lost your virginity.
also known as electroshock this therapy can have a therapeutic effect for mood disorders. during pregnancy this type of therapy causes few complications. to reduce the risks your doctor may: have the baby's heart rate and oxygen levels monitored during ect. suggest antacids or placement of an airway tube (intubation) to reduce the risk of gastric regurgitation or lung inflammation during ect. encourage you to eat well and drink plenty of water to help prevent premature contractions.
the male face-lift is infinitely more demanding than the female because of all the blood supply. see a males face has a much richer blood supply to support the thicker skin and the beard. all male skin generally is thicker than the comparable female. and the beard demands extra nutrition so we spend a lot more time there. so thats whatever time we quote for a woman we have to add on almost  minutes to an hour longer for a man. and in terms of cutting and rearranging features is there a difference? yeah the incision is different because a mans incision if done as a womans placed in the curvature of the ear the man would be shaving inside his ear canal because you slide up hair bearing skin. so on a man you have to put the incision in front here. it actually takes a little longer to close also since that incision is more visible to the eye it has to be absolutely primo. not that we dont try to be primo in these other areas but they lend themselves to easier healing fewer stitches. this you have to have at least two layers of stitches so that theres not stretching. its just more complex.
im not an export but as i know the pre-cum only dont have capable of made a women as pregnant. but if any thing above that may did.
i have very severe multiple site oa. i have it in both thumbs and now fingers rest ice or heat anti-inflammatory (pain meds). tylenol is a good pain reliever but will do nothing for the inflammation if you have inflammation. i use heating pads as i don't always tolerate the ice. the cold is what will cause me more pain such as a drop in outdoor temps in winter. try capsasin but be very very careful that you do not get it near your face eyes and mouth. capsasin used to work great on my back early on in the oa battle but now it does not work for me. good luck.

for starters under the new health reform law people with low incomes who have not qualified for medicaid in the past may now qualify. a little more than half of states will be expanding their medicaid programs to include individuals with incomes up to roughly $  per year. if your state does not expand its medicaid program you will likely be eligible for significant financial help to pay for a health plan. people making as much as $  per year are eligible for tax credits that will lower the cost of insurance. and if you make less than about $  per year you'll also pay less each time you go for medical care. if with all this the lowest priced health plan available to you costs more than % of your income or you don't make enough money to file income taxes you will not be penalized with a tax penalty for not having health insurance. you'll have the chance starting october  -- just  days from now -- to log onto your state's health insurance marketplace to begin searching for your options. i urge you to do so. you may be quite pleasantly surprised by the new options available to people with limited incomes. good luck!
hi. it can be probably related to fungal infection known as thrush. can you please tell that do you have any white cheesy deposits on the penile head? do you have any medical problems like diabetes? please revert back so that i can guide you accordingly. hope this helps.
no. marijuana is not safe in pregnancy. there are other medications that may be help but your ob must prescribe them. i hate to contradict the doctor but new studies are showing there is no correlation between marijuana consumption and harm to a fetus. depending on how you consume it may be a factor i would definitely not smoke it. if you are in a medicinal state i would find a doctor who deals with medicinal cannabis as they are going to be the best ones to answer all your questions %. i have known multiple women who have used cannabis throughout their entire pregnancy and their children are healthy and very intelligent.
yes that is a safe dosage but i do not know his weight or what is being treated.
after a heart attack some men and women fear that any type of sexual activity will provoke another one. people feel that if they've had a heart attack it's not a good idea to stress their bodies with sexual activity. but fewer than % of heart attacks are precipitated that way. it makes sense to think of sex as a form of exercise: if your doctor clears you for physical activity you're also likely safe for sex.
most helpful answer it is really not up to me or anyone to tell you whether you should be concerned or not. clearly you are concerned so my suggestion for you is to call the ob now. not wait two weeks. and talk to him/her or the advice rn if he has one. many women have no idea they are pregnant until their pregnancy is quite far. they did not have any symptoms either.
"it's possible you have a fungal infection commonly called "" jock itch. "" this can occur when you don't completely dry the groin area after exercising and showering. the skin of the groin area is home to many beneficial bacteria. however when this area remains damp it can allow other bacteria to flourish. this can result in a fungal infection. assuming you don't have any lesions (sores pimples - that sort of thing) it's probably safe for you to try an over-the-counter spray powder or cream for jock itch. you'll find these products near the medications for athlete's foot. to prevent jock itch be sure to towel dry as much as possible then apply a powder (or cornstarch) to help keep the area dry. if you're unsure about whether you actually have jock itch or if the over-the-counter treatment doesn't help the problem by all means visit your health care provider to determine what is going on. hope this helps!"
if you had an ectopic pregnancy then it would show on the sonogram. pregnancy test could be positive due to leftover tissue. as it was removed it should be examined by histopathology test. sometimes hcg (human chorionic gonadotropin) producing trophoblastic tissue (it is similar to a healthy pregnancy tissue) persists inside uterus giving positive pregnancy tests. if your test comes positive then you should do titer of serum beta-hcg every third day to see if it is rising or falling. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>

hi so the  your just  days into your cycle then and just finished with bleeding then? around day  is ovulation day its like give or take a day and male sperm lives in side you at most  to  days so there is this an outside chance of not being pregnant. but rereading the above you was having unprotected sex during your period then? correct then the chances are high your not pregnant and this what you call cervical fluid was probably your mucus plug forming or from that. but its still a waiting game but please don't stress keep happy and when you do get the chance just think bc and do something about it the pill is probably the best choice around. hope this helps you. good luck

while excess weight doesn't necessarily cause arthritis in places like your feet it can exacerbate it or make it progress in a more rapid fashion. excess weight puts additional stress on joints making arthritis symptoms worse. losing weight will not cure arthritis but it can help slow down the progression of the disease. for more details on how this works see this webmd article.

"get a list of her medications. either look the individual side effects up on the internet or ask your friendly neighborhood pharmacist to assist you. many drugs used in the elderly can cause confusion and certain combinations of drugs can have many different side effects (called drug interactions). many internet sites will also check for drug interactions. some drugs are not biologically processed well by the elderly and can form toxic levels. these drug toxicities would not be known unless she had a blood level of the particular drug tested. this happened with my own mother who was unresponsive and presumed to be dying. with the care center asked to have all of her medications stopped we agreed. a few days after her medications were stopped she ""woke up"" and lived happily for three more years! she was on a seizure medication from an er physician for years based on his assumption that she had a seizure (she did not). the care facility continued to give her this drug on a daily basis to the point where it was at toxic levels. a blood test confirmed the toxicity and she was never given it again. stay closely involved in her care. if you have power of attorney you have the right to get this information review her medical records and talk with the physician that is covering the care facility."

although the underlying cause of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is unknown certain factors can make seizures more likely in people with the condition. like other forms of epilepsy seizures in jme are also more likely during sleep deprivation or after drinking alcohol. sometimes seizures in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy can be triggered by flickering light like the sun reflecting off ocean waves or strobe lighting at a party. in some people acts of concentration like decision making or calculations can trigger seizures.

celiac disease is also known as celiac sprue nontropical sprue and gluten-sensitive enteropathy. the exact cause of celiac disease is not clear; however the outcome is well established. this disease affects the small intestine and its ability to absorb nutrients resulting in deficiencies and health complications. gluten is a protein found in wheat rye and barley. when you have celiac disease your body reacts to gluten as if it were toxic. this reaction occurs in the small intestine and ends up damaging the mucosal surface (the inner lining of the small intestine). when the mucosal surface is damaged the small intestine is not able to absorb nutrients properly. these nutrients include vitamins calcium carbohydrates protein and fats.
factors that increase the risk of ringworm include: being susceptible to fungal infection or having had a previous fungal infection on the scalp beard or other areas. having contact with people or animals with ringworm infections or with those who carry the ringworm fungus but do not have symptoms. having an impaired immune system (due to diseases such as diabetes or cancer ). living in a warm damp climate. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

i would need to know more information to answer this question for you. how long was the medication in the car? was it overnight and approximately what temperature was it? is it humid in the area? did the medication change color? all of these questions can help to determine whether the medication is still safe to administer to your child. most importantly check with your prescription health insurance to see if they cover a new prescription for damaged medications. if they do and the medication is affordable have your pharmacist call the health care professional for a new prescription.

it is not uncommon to take birth control to help regulate hormone cycles preventative medications to prevent the onset of a migraine (topamax inderal limbitrol) and symptomatic relief medications (imitrex) all together. hydrocodone basically covers up the pain. to take three preventative medications along with everything else you listed does seem like a bit much. i would look at lifestyle modifications that you could possibly make in order to aid in the decrease of migraine frequency. i would also seek another medical opinion from a migraine specialist or neurologist to see if all these medications are necessary. keep in mind that a few of these medications have side effects of headaches which could be a trigger to worsen or cause your migraines.
"there is no ""food remedy"" for premature ejaculation."
the main concern with prolonged ht is an increased risk of breast cancer. the risk seems to be greater in women taking combined therapy (estrogen plus a progestogen) than in women taking estrogen alone. and it may be that starting ht right away after menopause is also associated with greater risk. the good news is that the risk returns to baseline within several years after stopping ht. you should also be aware that combined ht can make it more difficult to read your mammogram (both while you're taking hormones and in the first years after stopping). as a result you might be called back for additional views or biopsy of suspicious areas. right now most experts recommend limiting ht to several years. the nams  ht position statement ( www. menopause. org/. pdf ) suggests that longer use is acceptable for a woman if she believes that the benefits outweigh the risks (especially if she's had trouble stopping therapy). the other condition includes women with low bone mass or osteoporosis who cannot tolerate osteoporosis drugs. the one exception to limiting ht to a few years is the woman who has had premature menopause either because of natural failure of her ovaries or surgical removal. in that case most experts are comfortable advising you to continue ht at least until the age of natural menopause about age  at which time you can reassess. if you've been taking hormones for a very long time you might want to start by discussing a lower dose. many clinicians now prescribe half the dose we used to use.

there is no laboratory test to diagnose bipolar disorder. doctors make the diagnosis through a combination of: a medical history asking questions to help identify other past and present health conditions that could cause the symptoms. a family history to identify bipolar disorder other mood disorders or substance abuse problems in close relatives. (all of these conditions are linked to bipolar disorder. ) a physical exam which can rule out other conditions with similar symptoms (such as hyperthyroidism ). a mental health assessment which can help identify your child's current mental state and the severity of depression or mania. other written or verbal mental health tests. in young children the symptoms of mania are more than just being a bother to adults and other children now and then. for example many children can be silly and giggly to a point that it bothers their parents sometimes. this is not considered to be a sign of mania. but if a child is silly and giggly for several hours several times almost every day and this is interrupting the family's usual routine then it may be a symptom of mania. before prescribing medicine to treat bipolar disorder your doctor will check your child for possible suicidal behavior by asking a few questions. see a list of questions your doctor may ask your child. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

parkinson's disease belongs to a group of conditions called movement disorders. the four main symptoms are: tremor or trembling in hands arms legs jaw or head. rigidity or stiffness of the limbs and trunk. bradykinesia or slowness of movement. postural instability or impaired balance. these symptoms usually begin gradually and worsen with time. as they become more pronounced patients may have difficulty walking talking or completing other simple tasks. not everyone with one or more of these symptoms has parkinson's disease as the symptoms sometimes appear in other diseases as well. parkinson's disease is both chronic meaning it persists over a long period of time and progressive meaning its symptoms grow worse over time. it is not contagious. although some parkinson's disease cases appear to be hereditary and a few can be traced to specific genetic mutations most cases are sporadic -- that is the disease does not seem to run in families. many researchers now believe that parkinson's disease results from a combination of genetic susceptibility and exposure to one or more environmental factors that trigger the disease. parkinson's disease is the most common form of parkinsonism the name for a group of disorders with similar features and symptoms. parkinson's disease is also called primary parkinsonism or idiopathic parkinson's disease. the term idiopathic means a disorder for which no cause has yet been found. while most forms of parkinsonism are idiopathic there are some cases where the cause is known or suspected or where the symptoms result from another disorder. for example parkinsonism may result from changes in the brain's blood vessels.
there is really little that can be done over the internet other than to offer you some advice. i don't know your husband's complete medical history or have any way to medically evaluate his memory issues but he does have some obvious contributory factors: tobacco marijuana use poor nutrition (a guess) insomnia due to unknown factors and perhaps many many other issues. he will need to see a medical professional to start the evaluation process assuming you will be able to convince him to do so. encouraging him to give up tobacco and marijuana may be futile but at least you can try and work on him.
i don't think that would be a problem but then again blood banks set their own rules. those human growth hormones have been long gone in your case so there is really no way that your blood would harbor any residuals in my opinion.
"lean proteins from animals are excellent sources of quality protein with low amounts of saturated fat. these include lean beef chicken/turkey fish low fat milk/yogurt (greek yogurt contains more protein than regular yogurt) and eggs/egg whites. each item contributes important nutrition. for example lean beef and poultry are sources of iron and zinc fish contains omega- fatty acids (dha and epa) eggs are a good source of choline and milk and yogurt are chock-full of calcium. plant proteins considered ""high quality"" include soy the only vegetarian option that provides all the essential amino acids. but other sources of protein such as beans nuts and seeds are very healthy contain fiber and provide a good amount of protein. variety is best!"

anytime that a pharmacist hears that there is blood in the stools i want to immediately tell people you need to get that checked out by a physician. many medications can cause things like diarrhea but not to the point that you should have blood in your stool. so as a pharmacist to this i am going to be like look you need to see the doctor right away and have it checked out. this could be some type of internal bleeding it could be nothing. but we want to make sure that we are safe and that the patient is being evaluated to find out what is the root cause and why did this happen?

if pregnancy is the concern then the best way to find out is to get a blood serum beta hcg test done. this is a confirmatory test for pregnancy as the urine pregnancy kits may show false positive results. if the levels of hcg are more than  or raised then pregnancy is confirmed. if the level is less than  then pregnancy is completely ruled out. if the test is positive then you should undergo an ultrasound pelvis to locate the pregnancy for its site which could be intrauterine or possibly in the tubes (ectopic). if the usg shows extrauterine pregnancy then you would require a laparoscopic salpingectomy to remove the damaged tube along with the ectopic. if the pregnancy is intrauterine then you may decide upon continuing the pregnancy. if the test is negative then the possible cause remains uti (urinary tract infection) or a possible pid (pelvic inflammatory disease) or endometriosis. also stress per se can cause derangement of hormonal balance and can cause heavy bleeding inspite of being on continuous progesterone pills. this can be controlled with antifibrinolytics in the absence of pregnancy. for further follow up consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>
scoliosis as an independent entity does not change the immune system it is just a developmental anomaly shared by many. this is not to say that your daughter does not have an immune problem due to something else so her doctor would be the best judge of this -- someone who knows her complete medical history. her allergies and asthma and some of the medications used to control it can certainly have an influence but not the scoliosis.

gum bleeding can be due to deficiency of vitamin c. vitamin supplements along with citrous fruits should take of this. back bone pain should be investigated by an xray and mri of the concerned part. there may also be a generalised weakness due to calcium and mineral deficiency.
burns are classified based upon their depth. a first degree burn is superficial and causes local inflammation of the skin. sunburns often are categorized as first degree burns. the inflammation is characterized by pain redness and a mild amount of swelling. the skin may be very tender to touch. second degree burns are deeper and in addition to the pain redness and inflammation there is also blistering of the skin. third degree burns are deeper still involving all layers of the skin in effect killing that area of skin. because the nerves and blood vessels are damaged third degree burns appear white and leathery and tend to be relatively painless. burns are not static and may mature. over a few hours a first degree burn may involve deeper structures and become second degree. think of a sunburn that blisters the next day. similarly second degree burns may evolve into third degree burns. regardless of the type of burn inflammation and fluid accumulation in and around the wound occur. moreover it should be noted that the skin is the body's first defense against infection by microorganisms. a burn is also a break in the skin and the risk of infection exists both at the site of the injury and potentially throughout the body. only the epidermis has the ability to regenerate itself. burns that extend deeper may cause permanent injury and scarring and not allow the skin in that area to return to normal function.
"platelets are the blood cells that stick together to form clots and thereby stop bleeding. just to clarify your number i'm assuming you mean your platelet count is   because platelets normally number in the hundreds of thousands. that is a bit on the low side for a male your age. you'd be well-advised to follow up with your health care provider to make sure this doesn't require any additional investigation. it probably isn't significant but because platelets stop bleeding you don't want to ignore a low platelet count. by the way taking aspirin doesn't reduce your platelet count. aspirin makes platelets less ""sticky "" so they don't clump together. it's unclear to me if you take aspirin as a sort of regimen (that is on a routine basis whether you need it or not) or if you normally take a few aspirin every week for headaches muscle aches or that sort of thing. if you're taking aspirin as a regimen i would advise you to stop doing so unless instructed by a doctor. many people have heard taking aspirin routinely can be good for the heart (and that's true) but this sort of aspirin regimen should only be done under the supervision of a health care professional. wishing you all the best!"
"that's a bit like going to have your appendix removed before you have appendicitis. it is sooo much easier (and more effective) to prevent an unintentional pregnancy that to take a hormone like plan b. remember that preventing conception is just one part of this equation. you also need std prevention and plan b will not to that. what should be done ""before hand"" is for the woman to be one an oral contraceptive (or another effective form of contraception) and insist that her partner use a condom % of the time/ if plan b was the answer then it would be called plan a."
what you have can be caused by rash bacteria being spread to you by the following things: one person with the rash uses a towel and you use it or you wear the same clothes that the person with the rash is wearing. this can be healed by aloe cream or soap use while you are in or out of the shower. if the rash is extremely painful or if it does not go away you have to make sure you get to a doctor or seek medical attention. but the best thing for you to do is to use aloe especially if you have an acne rash on your wounded area. but you should know that these rashes are very contagious and if you come in contact with the infected area then you can get infected with the same rash.
just about all vegetables help support a healthy cardiovascular system. veggies which contain deep dark pigments -- winter squash dark leafy greens broccoli kale tomatoes red peppers and carrots -- are good sources for antioxidant nutrients such as vitamin a and vitamin c and folate. these nutrients help protect the body's cells including cells in our heart and arteries. even white-colored vegetables such as onions and garlic contain important nutrients for heart health including a flavonoid called quercetin. most vegetables are also a good source of dietary fiber which is important for digestive health. one word of caution: dark green leafy vegetables such as collards kale and spinach are an excellent source of vitamin k which is important for the blood clotting mechanism. but if you're taking drugs such as coumadin or warfarin to prevent blood clots your doctor may advise you to avoid these kinds of vegetables. there are many vegetable which are good for heart such as carrot for vitamin a and a powerful antioxidants bell peppers which reduce homocysteine onions a rich source of sulphur-containing phytochemicals leafy greens are an better source of magnesium and many more.
assuming your mammograms have always been clear and your nipple isn't leaking any fluid this sensitivity may simply be due to dry skin. if you haven't already tried applying moisturizer to the nipple i'd suggest you do that. you also may try padding the nipple inside your bra with a piece of soft gauze to see if that helps. if the sensitivity persists or if the nipple gets red or crusty looking i'd suggest you see your primary health care provider. it is possible for cancers to arise in the nipple (this is called paget's disease of the nipple ) though it's not very common. hope this helps!
no. you are born a certain way based on your genetics. if you dont like your genitals then choose different parents. if youre fat down there then you can lose weight and improve the length of your penis but there is nothing you can do taking herbs will not improve your penile length weights on the end of your bed while you sleep will not improve it the vacuum devices that they sell will not do it. you are born with what youre born with and rather than stress and fret about problems or perceived inadequacies you really should be focusing on ways of finessing what youve got to make yourself and your partners happy. what you can do is be healthy take care of yourself learn other techniques to enhance the relationship its not just all about penile length theres other things that you can do during lovemaking that will enhance pleasure for the female partner if thats what its all about. if its just simply wanting to feel proud in the shower in front of other guys then you just have to understand that thats who you are thats how you were born and rather than spending your energy and time focusing on what you dont have focus on what you do have.

we don't know what causes lupus. there is no cure but in most cases lupus can be managed. lupus sometimes seems to run in families which suggests the disease may be hereditary. having the genes isn't the whole story though. the environment sunlight stress and certain medicines may trigger symptoms in some people. other people who have similar genetic backgrounds may not get signs or symptoms of the disease. researchers are trying to find out why.

once you have excluded medical causes there are multiple options to regain your even skin tone. a combination of glycolic aha and retinoid-based products along with a traditional topical skin care regimen for skin brightening will work. hydroquinone-based products work well. however there are other alternatives such as bearberry extract kojic acid licorice extract and niacin. these compounds will work toward brightening your skin and correcting your skin tone. the key is to work with a physician that is very familiar with your skin type and color because incorrect use of these agents can lead to further hypo- or hyperpigmentation.

keep in mind that hiv symtoms are really similar to symptoms from a lot of other ailments including colds flus and other things. also you don't get hiv symptoms right away after you are infected they take time to develop. also it's hard for a male to get hiv by receiving oral sex. many of your symptoms could be caused either by a regular cold or a simple case of the nerves. next time make your fun a little safer and you can save yourself a lot of stress and protect yourself from other things like herpes which you can get form oral sex. if you tested negative after  months you should be fine.

the various medicines used to treat osteoporosis work in different ways. the various medicines used to treat osteoporosis work in different ways. bisphosphonates including drugs like actonel boniva fosamax and reclast work by blocking the effects of certain bone-destroying cells. in this way bisphosphonates can slow down bone loss and lower your risk of fracture. evista is a different sort of medicine called a selective estrogen receptor modulator or serm. it works by mimicking some of the effects of the hormone estrogen which has a beneficial effect on bone mass. other treatments are available. bone is constantly remodeling -- old bone is removed by cells called osteoclasts and new bone is laid down by cells called osteoblasts. calcitonin a hormone made within the thyroid gland inhibits bone removal by osteoclasts and promotes bone formation by osteoblasts. forteo a synthetic hormone may also help build bone mass by enhancing the actions of osteoblasts. prolia stops the bone-removing cells before they cause bone loss and is used to treat postmenopausal woman with osteoporosis.

there are not many choices when you are pregnant with a cold. as a pharmacist i would also need to ask you some additional questions about your exact symptoms. you can take acetaminophen for a fever/aches/pain. you can also use a saline nasal spray to help loosen sinus congestion and try running a vaporizer at night in the bedroom while you sleep. if your symptoms do not get better after a few days or you continue to run a fever contact your health care provider.
"i don't have any way of knowing if your vaginal discharge is an std or not since i can't examine you look at the discharge under a microscope (or test it in a lab) nor do i know your sexual history (or your boyfriend's sexual history). the only thing you can do if your doctor's treatment is not working is to go back. be re-examined and be tested this time by a vaginal culture or smear. a person can have a yeast infection and ""something else"" so if you are worried about an std that ""something else"" will need to be specifically tested."
sorry you're dealing with this. i definitely would have these new symptoms checked out. there may be some cause/effect between the strep and the swollen painful joints or you may have developed something else entirely. at any rate the sudden onset of the symptoms you describe in an otherwise healthy young female is reason enough to seek medical care right away. your best bet is to return to the urgent care facility where you received the strep test and injection because they'll have your medical records at hand. normally i wouldn't advise someone who believes they have strep throat to seek urgent care. it's something that can be handled by a primary care provider. take care and best wishes!
hi i'm putting a link at the bottom of this post some of the things your writing about are side effects of the stick well you read ut and see what you think. good luck <link>
"i had the same problem severely a few years ago (almost every day to the point that i had to retire early). i improved quite a bit years ago with the help of a service dog who could sense when i was about to have an attack and alert me to take anti-anxiety medicine before the attack happened. however what really helped me at first was to take prophylactic medication until my generalized level of anxiety decreased. (i did relaxation desensitization therapy and other relaxation methods like yoga but it wasn't until the attacks reduced that any of it helped. ) in the meantime the best thing you can do for your friend is to help her with a solution for her real fear - vomiting in public. encourage her to carry a plastic zip-loc bag in her purse (so if she does get sick she won't make a mess that others will have to deal with) and tell her if she feels that she is going to be sick in public you will help her get to a private place to be sick if necessary. there is also an over-the-counter medication called emetrol that will calm the vomiting reflex and allow her to relax and calm down. i still have occasional serious nausea attacks but i always carry at least water and sometimes diet soda to calm my stomach. (for what it's worth i think my extreme anxiety on the subject was caused by a kindergarten classmate who vomited all over me during nap-time. ) the fear of vomiting in public is not typical but it can be very debilitating - and it is much more difficult to treat than a fear of heights or claustrophobia. it is virtually impossible to do progressive desensitization for vomiting - it's kind of difficult to ""partially"" vomit then relax!"

sex workers no matter what they charge have a higher incidence of sexually-transmitted diseases when compared to the general population. multiple partners infrequent testing and pre-existing stds that may not be obvious at the time of exposure are the greatest risks that one might encounter. whether you were exposed to one or more of the array of stds out there is anyone's guess. your concern should have been raised before seeking sexual contact with a prostitute but of course that is a bit too late now. testing may or may not reveal exposure or diseases in there incubation process but i think that it would be wise to be tested based on your level of worry over this incident.
the genital warts associated with human papillomavirus infection can be raised or flat. they can be small or large. colors vary including pink or flesh-colored. genital warts can appear on the cervix scrotum groin thigh anus or penis. treating the warts aggressively immediately after they appear is discouraged. they could still be emerging. repeat treatment would be needed later. hpv types  and  those associated with genital warts tend to grow for about six months then stabilize. sometimes visible genital warts go away without treatment. when treatment is indicated patients can get a prescription cream (podofilox or condylox and imiquimod or aldara) from their doctor to apply at home. in addition a doctor can remove the warts using various techniques. if the warts don't go away after six doctor-provided treatments the problem should be re-evaluated according to the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists.

if you've been out of the country recently you may need to have a tuberculin skin test. tuberculosis can cause night sweats chills cough fatigue fever as well as other things or can be asymptomatic. the skin test isn't painful just a bit uncomfortable because they create a tiny blister under your skin and check it  hours later for a reaction. you might be taking medication that causes these side effects. best advice is to just go see your doctor to make sure you don't have any infections.
it would be highly unlikely unless the tubal ligation surgery was blotched or the tubes magically re-attached that you would be pregnant. many hormonal conditions can mimic certain pregnancy symptoms but it would be wise for you to see your women's health specialist so you can be properly examined and diagnosed. wow! you just told my story<positive_smiley> i had my tubes tied  ago. i had  other children at the time and my new boyfriend didn't think he could have children! wrong! i started feeling sick tired moody but i was having my period on time every month. i thought i had a tumor cuz when i laid on my back i could feel a large hard mass in my tummy. i decided to go see my doctor ( same dr. that did tubal) i was  months pregnant<positive_smiley> i had no idea! it was nothing like my other  pregnancies. the explanation the doctor gave was. i didn't wait the suggested  weeks to have sex ( only  days) and the tubes were soft and swollen so the egg slipped through. i don't know if that was possible or if he was just covering his bootie! but i have a beautiful  yr old daughter<positive_smiley> but now at  i'm having all the classic signs of being pregnant again!
"you are most likely getting urticaria (hives). hives can be caused by the temperature change that you mentioned. you can try taking a long-acting antihistamine before these warm season exposures (loritidine zyrtec allegra) to see if it helps. urticaria caused by temperature changes may not be prevented by antihistamines however but it is worth a try. keeping your skin surface cooler would also seem to be a reasonable preventative; wearing clothing that ""breathes""."
with advances in technique the microsutures the instruments that we use the magnification and scopes pre and post-operative care we can achieve fertility in  to  percent of the men after theyve had a vasectomy and as far out as  years after theyve had a vasectomy. does it matter how old or archaic your vasectomy was? not at all. its not the technique of the vasectomy thats important. its not even the number of years since your vasectomy. it really is dependent on two factors. one is the skill and expertise of the microsurgeon does he or she know what they are doing and can do it well as well as female factors. if you fall in love with a -year-old whos demonstrated prior fertility things are probably going to be great. you dont need that much. on the other hand if you fall in love with a -year-old woman who is going through menopause then youre going to have a real hard time with conception no matter how good the surgeon is. so its female factor and skill and expertise of the microsurgeon are the major factors in determining the success of the reversal.

"you can expect on average to lose % to % of your body fat per month but the range of loss varies widely between individuals because there are so many variables that affect body composition including age gender amount of body fat and muscle mass that you start with and a myriad of hormones that control how efficient your body is at storing fat and metabolizing it. unlike body weight where no more than two pounds per week of loss is recommended there are no standards or guidelines for how quickly to lose body fat or gain muscle because there hasn't been enough research to determine a healthy body fat percentage. you should also know that when you lose weight as much as % of the lost weight could be muscle. that is you could lose  pounds of muscle if you lose  pounds. the principle problem in terms of weight loss with losing so much muscle is that muscle is the metabolically active ""organ"" in your body that burns most of the calories and so losing it could slow down your weight- and fat-loss efforts. in fact losing muscle is one of the factors involved in weight-loss plateaus. the good news is that studies show that aerobic and resistance exercise can prevent muscle loss by as much as % and % respectively if you do it consistently three or more times per week. measuring body composition during weight loss is objective data that could prove as important as measuring weight. a bioelectric impedance (bia) scale can help you do that. bia scales estimate body fat by sending a very weak (and safe) electrical signal through your body and then measuring the resistance to the signal created by your body fat. fat is a poor conductor of electricity and so the more fat you have the more resistance there is. there is a % to % error possible with bia that depends on your hydration status time of last meal last round of exercise amount of alcohol in your system and some medications (for example diuretics). the error can be even higher than % so be sure to follow the manufacturer's guidelines to obtain the most reliable estimate. you can find bia scales online."

please do not take tylenol ( acetaminophen ) with vicodin (hydrocodone-apap) because vicodin contains tylenol already. it is very easy to exceed the maximum daily limit of acetaminophen by combining these two drugs. and high doses of acetaminophen may lead to liver damage. if the hydrocodone isn't controlling your pain i'd suggest you speak with your health care provider. from a pharmacology standpoint there's no harm in combining ibuprofen with hydrocodone but ibuprofen is a blood thinner. so if you're taking hydrocodone to control post-surgical pain for example your doctor may not want you taking a blood thinner like ibuprofen. also your health care provider may not want you taking ibuprofen based on other medications you currently take your past medical history and many other factors. so in a nutshell i'd suggest you simply put a call in to your provider for guidance on what medications are safe for you to take for pain control. wishing you all the best! vicodin which is a combination of acetaminophen (the active ingredient in tylenol) and hydrocodone. long-term effects on the body from products that contain acetaminophen can lead to severe liver damage and liver failure. gallus detox center is a private inpatient medical detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at --.
thank you nohard for the info. my periods are mostly(%) regular and never experienced the post menstrual blood neither have any disease or implants nor on the birth control pills. so uterine incapacity hormonal imbalance or uterine cysts and disease may not be the cause. almost  yrs ago gyna prescribed my a  days course of metronidazole and told me every thing is ok and nothing to worry about. but i am not satisfied as the pain during(first  days) and after periods(for  days) are severe. also first  days of period are always with heavy bleeding. should i ask my gyna to prescribed a test? if yes please recommend.
what should you do? you may need to wait a bit longer. some young women can have their first period delayed to age  and this is considered normal. just because all of your friends may be having their period does not really apply to you. you are well into puberty so the hormones are doing their job in the other departments. just not your menstrual cycle. yes there can be medical reasons so it would be appropriate for you to see a gynecologist (women's health expert) for a brief examination and perhaps a blood test.

hi this would be probably an abdominal muscle strain have you been coughing or sneezing vigorously recently? or have you carried sth heavy? if so then it is probably a muscle strain u can use ice application for a few days then hot fomentsthe other possibility is an inflammation of the ascending colon or a spastic colon. but this depends on your history whether you have complained from gastrointestinal disorder before? .
not necessarily. while it is possible to experience more side effects with higher doses not everyone does. the only way to know is to try the medication at the higher dose and see how you react.
blackheads (comedones) can occur on any skin surface. since the penis and scrotum are covered with skin you can certainly get them in this location.
most helpful answer yes an  year old child can have a menstrual flow. even for a day assuming she has reached sexual maturity (breast development public hair etc. ) but keep in mind that there may be other sources of bleeding to consider such as vaginal trauma straddle injuries rectal bleeding etc.
many women (about % of those affected) with bacterial vaginosis actually have no symptoms. when symptoms do occur vaginal discharge and odor are the predominant symptoms. usually there are no other symptoms. the amount of vaginal discharge that is considered normal varies from woman to woman. therefore any degree of vaginal discharge that is abnormal for a particular woman should be evaluated. some women may experience an unpleasant fishy odor with vaginal discharge. the discharge is usually thin and grayish white. the discharge is often more noticeable after sexual intercourse.

your daughter does not need to buy new insurance. she can either stay on your plan and make no change or choose instead to be covered by her employer's plan. the best thing to do is to evaluate both plans to determine which provides better coverage for her needs at the best price. and remember just because two plans are offered by the same insurance company doesn't mean they provide the same benefits.

as long as she is supervised and as long as there is absolutely no chance of an accidental suffocation she may be able to sleep with her bear. although i do not know the size of this stuffed animal or the ability of your child to extricate herself from a heavy toy that may compromise her airways. personally children are safer with smaller toys to cuddle smaller blankets and no pillows.
in my opinion you have two possible explaination  you have an ear infection which require an otologist  a virus infection need to see your blood tests to identify its type
most helpful answer normal  false false false  most body odors that occur in sweaty areas (groin armpits etc. ) are due to bacterial overgrowth not a fungus. i dont know if you are a male or female but you may want to try a good antibacterial soap during a shower dry carefully and spray this area (avoiding the sensitive parts of course) with an anti-perspiring / deodorant spray just like you would use in your armpits. controlled perspiration would go a long way in controlled a disagreeable odor. if you are female malodors can originate from the vagina. if you are male the area under the scrotum is often the culprit. wear looser under-clothing especially at night and allow this area to breathe a bit.
the last five day treatment is probably azithromycin - an antibiotic that you take for five days but stays working for ten. this drug is convenient to take but many of the pathogens that cause middle ear infections in children are now resistant to it. the first drug was probably amoxicillin. your son may need something else assuming the infection is a bacterial type. many ear infections are viral. a child under six months who is getting ear infection is more likely to be a frequent-flyer of sorts. they may end up getting lots of them and often end up getting tubes. a child in day-care or one exposed to tobacco smoke is likely to get more ear infections. a child who was not or is not breat fed will also get more. the next step may be to see an ent specialist for a consultation. if your child has middle ear fluid that has been persistent the ent may recommend tubes.
this would be highly unlikely. it is the ingestion of shellfish in an allergic person that is the real culprit. just having shellfish present in the room should not be an issue.

becoming educated about breast cancer and your care can be confusing especially with any doctors and other health care providers involved. here are some tips for keeping track: do not be afraid to ask your doctor nurse or other health care provider to repeat any instructions or medical terms that you don't understand. your providers should always be available to answer your questions and address your concerns. make use of resources and support services offered by your hospital and in the community. learning more about your disease will help you feel more comfortable with your treatment. ask your family and friends to help you sort through the information you receive. talk with other patients and families about breast cancer and its treatment.
this is an excellent question! i can understand why this distinction could be confusing to some people because both stroke and a subdural hematoma involve bleeding inside the skull. however the two conditions are very different. in the simplest terms stroke involves bleeding inside the brain; a subdural hematoma involves bleeding outside the brain. when a stroke occurs a blood vessel within the brain tissue either ruptures or becomes blocked. this in turn deprives an area of brain tissue from receiving the oxygen-rich blood it needs to survive. stroke can occur without warning and often includes one or more of these symptoms : one-sided body weakness numbness or loss of function slurred speech trouble finding the right words sudden vision changes sudden balance changes severe headache a subdural hematoma on the other hand occurs in the tissues that surround the brain. many people don't realize the brain is wrapped in several layers of tissue for protection. first comes the scalp; then the bone tissue of the skull; then a tough fibrous layer of tissue called the 'dura mater;' then a webby layer called 'arachnoid' tissue; and lastly a delicate tissue-paper like layer called the 'pia mater. ' the brain itself lies below all of these layers of tissue. a subdural hematoma is a blood clot that forms due to a bleed that occurs below the dura mater and above the arachnoid tissue. a bleed can occur here due to trauma such as a concussion or other head injury. a subdural hematoma can cause pressure inside the skull to rise compressing delicate brain tissue and causing cells to die. it is a medical emergency that requires a procedure called a craniotomy to remove the blood clot and relieve swelling and pressure inside the skull. keep in mind i have greatly simplified the anatomy in this description. but i hope it helps you better understand how a stroke is different from a subdural hematoma!
you probably  know much about mini warts (or technically speaking molluscum contagiosum). every summer parents bring their kids in with curious little rashes that just dont seem to go away. they are tiny firm raised flesh-colored bumps that often show up in the armpit the back of the knees the trunk the forearm or the inner thigh. (the only place they dont show up are the palms and soles. ) so what are they? a virus. yes these tiny warts are caused by a virus. and yes that means they are contagious. they spread from person-to-person by direct contact with the spots. and kids can spread them around their own bodies by scratching and picking at them. the spots are kind of itchy but they are really more of a nuisance than a serious health issue. kids with eczema tend to have more problems because the itchy spots lead to scratching which leads to eczema flare-ups. if left alone the molluscum eventually goes away. but eventually can mean  months or  years. molluscum isnt just a summer virus but i do see more kids with it after spending their summer in the swimming pool. studies looking at the ability of the virus to spread in a chlorinated pool have been inconclusive thus far. thus there are no regulations restricting kids from public swimming pools when theyve got those spots. (besides the fact that one in  kids would have to stay out of a pool if there was a rule thats how common molluscum is! ) the molluscum virus also seems to spread through non-chlorinated water (like your bathtub). if one of your kids has molluscum do not let him share a bath or a drying off towel with your other kids. about % of kids with molluscum will spread it to their sibling. if you want to get rid of the molluscum before they decide to go away on their own i suggest speaking to your childs doctor or consulting a dermatologist. there are a variety of methods none of which is % successful or pain-free. so you should consider the options before proceeding.
none of the over-the-counter appetite suppressants are approved by the fda. therefore we cannot determine if they are safe or effective. all of them are supplements which means they are not regulated the same way medications are and there is no guarantee of what is actually in them.
i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it's always scary when we feel as if we can't breathe! i'd recommend you see a doctor about this. you didn't say what your age is but many conditions can cause the symptoms you describe -- and some of them are more common at older ages. only a physical examination by a health care professional can help get to the cause of this and treat it appropriately. i hope you're able to see a doctor soon and get to the bottom of this unpleasant situation!
i think you might be experiencing complicated infection in lung that caused pleurisy. a sputum culture is needed to show which bacteria is it and what antibiotic is suitable for its treatment. later. breathing exercises and avoiding cold air is going to help. using also spirometer can help increase your lung capacity. a cup of coffee in the morning after a small meal is good for helping bronchospasm. reduce carbs intake.
i guess anything is possible when you deal with humans but your current boyfriend most likely acquired hpv from one of his previous partners. not you. since you do not have hpv you cannot carry it to other people.
i'm sorry you're going through this. it sounds miserable! my initial reaction is that you should make an appointment to see a medical professional. diarrhea (by which i mean mostly watery stool with little to no solid waste in it) lasting longer than a week is not normal for an adult. usually if diarrhea is caused by food poisoning it resolves within a few days. the pain you describe in conjunction with the diarrhea also is concerning. while i'm not suggesting you have any type of life-threatening condition i would suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider as soon as possible. meanwhile it's crucial for you to drink plenty of fluids. because your diarrhea has been going on for so long you might also want to sip a sports drink like gatorade. dehydration might explain why you feel so weak. i wish you all the best in finding out what's causing this problem!
"yes it is. the full name of the disease is "" ebola hemorrhagic fever. "" it is a blood-borne virus that can only be transmitted from person to person through direct contact with bodily fluids. while the virus ""lives"" in the blood so to speak it also is present in other body fluids such as saliva. the chances of getting ebola in the united states are very very small. you cannot catch ebola from casual contact with another person such as touching their hair. people infected with the ebola virus can only pass the virus to another person while they have active symptoms such as a fever. if you live in the united states you need not worry about catching ebola. wishing you well!"
yes for sure bone tumors can show up on xray and better on mri if an abnormality of the bone detected then a biopsy is needed. which is not applicable for your case
knee and hip replacements consisting of metal-on-metal may cause a condition called metallosis. this side effect happens when rubbing of the metal implanted surfaces results in chromium and cobalt particles accumulating in the blood stream to toxic levels (some cobalt & chromium is normally found in the blood stream to carry-out routine cellular actions). the recommended treatment for metallosis is a complete surgical revision (removing the implant and installing a new implant) of the knee or hip.
i recently had emergency medical care in austria. it was my responsibility to pay the bill. i do have u. s. insurance but have yet to receive reimbursement. in your aunt's case with emergency surgery she may be considered among the multitude of uninsured. i am pleased that we live in a country where someone. a visitor. without insurance or the means to pay can get professional care that may be life-saving. i don't believe that her sponsors are financially responsible but i am not an attorney. i would suggest that she speak with the billing department of the hospital for some advice and assistance in this matter. since she is not a u. s. citizen and a taxpayer i can't imagine that she would be qualified for medicare after the fact but hospitals often have creative financial solutions. the good news is that your aunt received care.
no. this statement is not true.
i don't have an answer for your specific question but i can give you some general information about staph infections. staph infections are caused by staphylococcus bacteria. these bacteria often reside on the skin or inside the nose or mouth of otherwise healthy people. usually these bacteria cause no problems. when the skin is broken however these germs can get into the tissue and cause an infection. any break in the skin such as a scratch presents an opportunity for staph to invade. many staph infections remain confined to the skin. these usually can be treated easily with oral antibiotics. in more severe cases staph bacteria can get into the bloodstream and cause serious symptoms. these cases usually require hospitalization and treatment with intravenous antibiotics. if you experienced a staph infection after undergoing a procedure you should ask your doctor if the two things are related. i am not familiar with the risks involved with sclerotherapy. it is quite possible staph infection is a known risk of that procedure although doctors and support staff take every precaution to disinfect the skin prior to cutting or penetrating it in any way. your question brings up a great topic which is always ask about infection risks prior to any medical procedure no matter how minor. these days infection is always a risk when you undergo a procedure that punctures the skin. it is wise to understand all the risks before a procedure so you can weight them against the potential benefits. wishing you well!
this is a great question. tylenol pm is actually not recommended in pregnancy because of the fact that not only does it contain tylenol but it contains an antihistamine like benadryl or diphenhydramine. and that's really not recommended for use in pregnant moms. so you want to avoid that. tylenol is actually the safest pain-reliever to use in pregnant women but i want to make sure that you use it for short-term used only. and if you are going to take it make sure you check it out with your doctor first. and if you have any questions come and ask us.
you are at risk for chickenpox if you have not had chickenpox or the vaccine and you: live with someone who has chickenpox. work or play indoors for more than  hour with someone who has chickenpox. are in the hospital and share a room with someone who later develops chickenpox or are cared for by a staff member who later develops chickenpox. have an impaired immune system. your risk of getting chickenpox is especially high if you are exposed to a household member with chickenpox because of the close contact. in addition you may develop a more severe case than the person who infected you. chickenpox is most contagious from  to  days before the rash appears until the blisters have dried and formed crusts. some people also are at increased risk of developing complications from chickenpox such as newborns teenagers adults-especially pregnant women-and those with impaired immune systems. after you have had chickenpox or the vaccine you become immune to the virus. it is possible that you may have a slight reaction after reexposure such as a few spots and a slight fever. but you are not likely toget chickenpox more than once. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

unfortunately i cannot really give you a second opinion because i have no way of examining him first-hand. it would not be prudent for me to make an assessment based solely on the information in your posting let alone predict future outcomes. as much as i would like to help you the only way for your son to be properly assesed is for him to see a medical provider -- someone who can examine those delicate parts. thank you very much &yes i took him to his phys. and they took test and examined. we will have more knowledge tomorrow! -aj's mommy
every exercise session should include a warm-up conditioning phase and a cool-down. warm-up. this helps your body adjust slowly from rest to exercise. a warm-up reduces the stress on your heart and muscles slowly increases your breathing circulation (heart rate) and body temperature. it also helps improve flexibility and reduce muscle soreness. the best warm-up includes stretching range of motion activities and the beginning of the activity at a low intensity level. conditioning. this follows the warm-up. during the conditioning phase the benefits of exercise are gained and calories are burned. be sure to monitor the intensity of the activity (check your heart rate). don't over do it. cool-down. this is the last phase of your exercise session. it allows your body to gradually recover from the conditioning phase. your heart rate and blood pressure will return to near resting values. cool-down does not mean to sit down! in fact do not sit stand still or lie down right after exercise. this may cause you to feel dizzy or lightheaded or have heart palpitations (fluttering in your chest). the best cool-down is to slowly decrease the intensity of your activity. you may also do some of the same stretching activities you did in the warm-up phase.
there is no one specific test that establishes the diagnosis of toxic shock syndrome. the diagnosis of tss is difficult until the characteristic symptoms evolve and a source for the infection is identified. besides a thorough physical examination (which includes a pelvic examination in women) blood tests will usually be ordered and might include a white blood cell count (to look for signs of infection) blood cultures (evaluating for possible bacteria in the bloodstream) and evaluation of kidney and liver function. blood tests to exclude other diseases may also be ordered. chest x-rays or ct scans of the abdomen or pelvis can be ordered to evaluate the internal organs depending on the results of the initial evaluation.
hi. can you please tell which contraceptive are you taking? progesterone containing pills are not harmful but if it has some other combination then it should be immediately checked by your gynaecologist. hope this helps.
most helpful answer thanks for providing all the great background information! if several different doctors have told you the blemish is a cyst then that's probably accurate. a cyst is a pocket of tissue that's filled with some type of fluid. the type of fluid can vary depending on the type of cyst. some are filled with fatty acids while others contain pus. it sounds like your cyst is located within the skin layer not in the breast tissue which is good news. skin cysts are very common and do tend to drain occasionally as you've described. the fact the cyst has gotten bigger and changed color is a good reason to have a health care provider re-evaluate this. it's possible the cyst needs to be treated by having it drained or even removed. only your health care provider can say for sure. cysts are an annoyance but luckily they're not a serious disease. good luck to you as you cope with this!
certain things are thought to trigger migraine attacks in some people. some of these triggers are: certain foods or beverages (for example cheese chocolate citrus fruit caffeine alcohol). stress. change in a behavior (such as under/oversleeping; missing a meal; change in diet). hormonal changes in women (for example menstruation). you may be able to prevent migraine attacks or diminish their frequency if you understand what specifically triggers your attacks. keeping a headache diary may help you identify and monitor the possible migraine triggers you encounter. once the triggers are identified you and your doctor can modify your treatment and lifestyle appropriately.

autism is a medical condition in which there are problems with communication and social interaction. this is a rather serious condition to be diagnosed without a complex and complete examination. the child might lack eye contact as you mentioned. the babbling in these children might be accompanied with unusual gestures repeating othersâ words whereas the words are less frequently associated with appropriate gestures. repetitive behaviour might be one of the symptoms that are most easy to recognize. it might include: compulsive behaviour ritualistic behaviour stereotypy or even self-injury. as for the slow improvement of the speech please consider that many children just need more time to talk and to be understood. different conditions might be causing this situation. sometimes the child might need help from a specialist for speech and language therapy whom you are advised to visit. s/he might be able to detect if there are any physiological problems with the speech-related organs (the tongue the palate the throat) or the child simply needs more time to develop the speech. to exclude autism you might want to take your child to a neuropsychologist pediatrician. until than please keep in mind that there are many children at the age of  months whose speech is not fluent enough to be understood clearly.

"""atherosclerosis starts when high blood pressure smoking or high cholesterol damage the endothelium (a thin layer of cells that lines arteries keeping them toned and smooth) "" says richard stein md national spokesperson for the american heart association. ""at that point cholesterol plaque formation begins. "" ""it's a jumble of lipids or cholesterol cells and debris and it creates a bump on the artery wall "" explains stein. as the process of atherosclerosis continues ""the bump gets bigger. "" a big enough bump can create a blockage. atherosclerosis tends to happen throughout the body. ""so if you have plaque in your heart you're at a higher risk for stroke and vice versa "" says stein. atherosclerosis usually causes no symptoms until middle or older age. once narrowings become severe they choke off blood flow and can cause pain. blockages can also suddenly rupture causing blood to clot inside an artery at the site of the rupture."

epilepsy is a brain disorder in which clusters of nerve cells or neurons in the brain sometimes signal abnormally. neurons normally generate electrochemical impulses that act on other neurons glands and muscles to produce human thoughts feelings and actions. in epilepsy the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed causing strange sensations emotions and behavior or sometimes convulsions muscle spasms and loss of consciousness. during a seizure neurons may fire as many as  times a second much faster than normal. in some people this happens only occasionally; for others it may happen up to hundreds of times a day. more than  million people in the united states -- about  in  -- have experienced an unprovoked seizure or been diagnosed with epilepsy. for about  percent of those diagnosed with epilepsy seizures can be controlled with modern medicines and surgical techniques. however about  to  percent of people with epilepsy will continue to experience seizures even with the best available treatment. doctors call this situation intractable epilepsy. having a seizure does not necessarily mean that a person has epilepsy. only when a person has had two or more seizures is he or she considered to have epilepsy. epilepsy is not contagious and is not caused by mental illness or mental retardation. some people with mental retardation may experience seizures but seizures do not necessarily mean the person has or will develop mental impairment. many people with epilepsy have normal or above-average intelligence. famous people who are known or rumored to have had epilepsy include the russian writer dostoyevsky the philosopher socrates the military general napoleon and the inventor of dynamite alfred nobel who established the nobel prize. several olympic medalists and other athletes also have had epilepsy. seizures sometimes do cause brain damage particularly if they are severe. however most seizures do not seem to have a detrimental effect on the brain. any changes that do occur are usually subtle and it is often unclear whether these changes are caused by the seizures themselves or by the underlying problem that caused the seizures. while epilepsy cannot currently be cured for some people it does eventually go away. one study found that children with idiopathic epilepsy or epilepsy with an unknown cause had a  to  percent chance of becoming seizure-free by  years after their diagnosis. the odds of becoming seizure-free are not as good for adults or for children with severe epilepsy syndromes but it is nonetheless possible that seizures may decrease or even stop over time. this is more likely if the epilepsy has been well-controlled by medication or if the person has had epilepsy surgery.
i am not sure what your question is but your blood pressure and heart rate are normal. unless you are having symptoms of low blood pressure such as dizziness especially when standing a blood pressure of / is not necessarily an issue. it's more common for young women like yourself to have blood pressure that is on the low side but still normal. here's some more information about low blood pressure.
no those are two different antibiotics. zosyn is a combination of two medications -- the antibiotic piperacillin and the medication tazobactam which helps the antibiotic work better and lessen the likelihood that the bacteria is resistant to the antibiotic. clindamycin is a completely different antibiotic. zosyn is given in the vein whereas clindamycin can be taken as a pill (also can be given in the vein). both antibiotics could be helpful in treating a tooth abscess depending on the bacteria causing the abscess.
hepatitis b is spread mainly by exposure to infected blood or body secretions. in infected individuals the virus can be found in the blood semen vaginal discharge breast milk and saliva. hepatitis b is not spread through food water or by casual contact. in the united states sexual contact is the most common means of transmission followed by using contaminated needles for injecting illicit drugs tattooing body piercing or acupuncture. additionally hepatitis b can be transmitted through sharing toothbrushes and razors contaminated with infected fluids or blood. hepatitis b also may be spread from infected mothers to their babies at birth (so-called 'vertical' transmission). this is the most prevalent means of transmission in regions of the world where hepatitis b rates are high. the rate of transmission of hepatitis b from mother to newborn is very high and almost all infected infants will develop chronic hepatitis b. fortunately transmission can be significantly reduced through immunoprophylaxis. rarely hepatitis b can be transmitted through transfused blood products donated livers and other organs. however blood and organ donors are routinely screened for hepatitis which typically prevents this type of transmission.

i just wanted to add that i did not get injured in any way that would have caused this. we have to stand in derby stance which is basically a squat position and do crossovers. it seems the crossovers are what really hurt my leg i'm guessing with all the weight mainly on the left side? if i go the other direction it's only the left leg that still hurts not the right. i've asked other girls about it and noone has any idea i couldn't even find anything on google! thanks for any input.
airborne is supposed to boost your immune system so if you already have the flu it won't be very effective. there's also little evidence that airborne actually works and they were sued a few years ago for making false claims. but i know a lot of people swear by it.

i do not know anything about your mother or her medical history but i would be concerned as well. i cannot imagine that six days into a potent antibiotic course that she would be having uti symptoms. the vact that her bp is low her heart rate is high and she is having difficulty breathing would not likely be related to the uti. she needs to see her regular medical provider as soon as possible for an examination.

you should call your pediatrician immediately. severe diarrhea in an infant can become life-threatening because it can cause serious dehydration. meanwhile be sure you're providing plenty of fluids to your baby including an electrolyte drink such as pedialyte. this may help her avoid severe dehydration and can help keep her electrolytes in balance. if your baby is running a fever along with the diarrhea you should take her to the emergency room. these symptoms in a -month-old should not be taken lightly. i wish you and your baby all the best!
commonly hfm is an illness of children less than  years of age; adults generally were exposed during childhood and maintain a natural immunity. information regarding fetal exposure to hfm during pregnancy is limited. no solid evidence exists that maternal enterovirus infection is associated with complications such as spontaneous abortion or congenital defects. however should a baby be born to a mother with active hfm symptoms the risk of neonatal infection is high. typically such newborns have a mild illness. rarely overwhelming infection involving vital organs such as liver heart and brain can be lethal.
most helpful answer it would be very unlikely that your husband has a uti that is being passed to you but sexual activity alone can lead to urinary problems including infections. the mechanics of vaginal intercourse often spreads bacteria that has colonized in the neighborhood. not all urinary burning is a uti; some are just cystitis (irritation of the urinary opening). women who do get infections associated with sexual activity frequently can be prescribed an post-coital antibiotic by their medical provider.
assuming your are healthy this should not be a problem but now is the time to take advantage of the baby's father! get him to mow the grass!

hi since you described no other symptoms like lymph node inflammation or nipple discharges or pain so it is highly likely it is benign (nothing serious) however if size changes you must see an oncologist good luck
i see this everyday in my practice and it's a real problem. this is a condition that's most likely called melasma. we used to only see it in pregnant women but what happens now is that when women take the pill and the longer they take the pill; so it's almost any contraceptive whether it's a patch or a pill that contains hormones the longer you are on that and then when you combine that with even minimal sun exposure can cause a patchy discoloration usually symmetric on the cheeks or upper lip and even on the forehead. this gets darker in the summer often fades in the winter but on the upper lip especially can look like a mustache and women just hate this. so it's important to understand the underlying cause it's hormones and sun exposure either from being on the pill or just your own natural hormones or during pregnancy. then the other part is the sun that you really have to protect against. when i say protect i don't mean if you are going to the beach. if you are just going to walk on the street get your newspaper from the corner go to the bus stop you have to have adequate protection on. wear a hat if you can try to stay in the shade when you can. this condition can be treated but it can often be difficult to treat. what we use are things like hydroquinones or ingredients that have sepiwhite or mulberry root extract or liquorice extract those are ingredients you can look for on products and as dermatologists we can also do treatments in the office. there are certain chemical peels that we can do that can help target that pigment in a very specific way and help lighten it. but if you go in the sun it will come right back.
swelling in the face can be normal but it may also be a sign of infection. immediately call the surgeon that removed the tooth to ask about the swelling. if you cannot immediately contact the surgeon make sure your son is taking an antibiotic. use ice packs on that side of his face to help reduce the swelling.

in the early stages crohn's disease causes small scattered shallow crater-like areas (erosions) on the inner surface of the bowel. these erosions are called aphthous ulcers. with time the erosions become deeper and larger ultimately becoming true ulcers (which are deeper than erosions) and causing scarring and stiffness of the bowel. as the disease progresses the bowel becomes increasingly narrowed and ultimately can become obstructed. deep ulcers can puncture holes in the wall of the bowel and bacteria from within the bowel can spread to infect adjacent organs and the surrounding abdominal cavity. when crohn's disease narrows the small intestine to the point of obstruction the flow of the contents through the intestine ceases. sometimes the obstruction can be caused suddenly by poorly digestible fruit or vegetables that plug the already narrowed segment of the intestine. when the intestine is obstructed digesting food fluid and gas from the stomach and the small intestine cannot pass into the colon. the symptoms of small intestinal obstruction then appear including severe abdominal cramps nausea vomiting and abdominal distention. obstruction of the small intestine is much more likely since the small intestine is much narrower than the colon to begin with. deep ulcers can puncture holes in the walls of the small intestine and the colon and create a tunnel between the intestine and adjacent organs. if the ulcer tunnel reaches an adjacent empty space inside the abdominal cavity a collection of infected pus (an abdominal abscess) is formed. patients with abdominal abscesses can develop tender abdominal masses high fevers and abdominal pain. when the ulcer tunnels into an adjacent organ a channel (fistula) is formed. the formation of a fistula between the intestine and the bladder (enteric-vesicular fistula) can cause frequent urinary tract infections and the passage of gas and feces during urination. when a fistula develops between the intestine and the skin (enteric-cutaneous fistula) pus and mucous emerge from a small painful opening on the skin of the abdomen. the development of a fistula between the colon and the vagina (colonic-vaginal fistula) causes gas and feces to emerge through the vagina. the presence of a fistula from the intestines to the anus (anal fistula) leads to a discharge of mucous and pus from the fistula's opening around the anus.

the question of whether or not it is wise to have cosmetic surgery while pregnant comes up most often when a patient who is scheduled for surgery finds out that she is pregnant. she then calls us and asks for our advice. nearly all the procedures that we do in elective cosmetic facial surgery are done under anesthesia; it is never wise to have a procedure while pregnant. that is why we do a pregnancy test just prior to the surgery. the chances of aborting the fetus are extremely high if one has a general anesthetic in the first three months of pregnancy. in any event even if one were beyond the first three months it just doesnt make much sense because the body during pregnancy has changed with respect to circulating levels of hormones. there are blood count issues and a variety of reasons why it makes absolutely no sense to have an elective procedure during pregnancy. even if an operation could be done under local anesthesia i would never undertake such an operation because the local anesthetic itself gets into the blood stream and could possibly enter the fetal circulation. bottom line why ever take a chance?
emphysema is not a curable disease. once lung damage has occurred it cannot be reversed. the goal of treatment is to stop further lung destruction and preserve lung function. the patient needs to know that the focus is on improving quality of life and limiting the intrusion of emphysema on daily activities.
it's highly unlikely that botulinum toxin (botox is one common brand) could cause a transient ischemic attack (tia). you don't say why you had injections of botulinum toxin (while people associate botox with cosmetic treatments in truth there are many therapeutic uses for the medication) but it's likely the tias were coincidental to your botulinum toxin injections. tias occur when blood flow to an area of the brain is temporarily blocked (usually by a blood clot) in one of the arteries of the brain. botulinum toxin is a muscle relaxant drug. it isn't injected into the blood stream and has no relationship to clot formation. botulinum toxin is injected into muscles for various reasons -- to smooth wrinkles around the eyes (cosmetic) or to help reduce spasms of the pectoral muscle in breast reconstruction after mastectomy (therapeutic) to name just two examples. if you have any concerns about whether or not botulinum toxin could have been involved in your tia you should talk to the healthcare provider who performed the botox injections. wishing you well!

there is no disputing the importance of proper nutrition during pregnancy. there is some dispute about the safety of caffeine during this time. one concern is that caffeine may lead to miscarriages. in a study following  pregnant women no relationship between caffeine consumption up to  mg/day and adverse pregnancy outcomes was found. another study examined the relationship between caffeine consumption and spontaneous abortions in over   women and found no association. a recent study found that caffeine can reach the follicular fluid of the ovaries. it also found that an increase in coffee consumption was associated with an increased number of aborted pregnancies. on the other side research has also shown no clear relationship between caffeine intake and fertility and birth defects. even with this evidence everyone agrees that there is a limit for how much caffeine can be consumed during pregnancy. the majority of the subjects in the studies were consuming small to moderate amounts of caffeine. it is difficult to accurately test the effects of very high intakes of caffeine without risking the health of the mother and child. the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists recommends a caffeine limit of the equivalent of one to two cups of coffee per day during pregnancy.

obviously it is a musculoskeletal or soft tissue origin. it could be a bursa or a subcutaneous sebaceous sac pressing on a costal nerve try using anti inflammatory gel for a couple of days if not going well then get it aspired and a sample should be taken.
i don't know the age of your baby but if he/she is over six months why not just use one of those medications. since ibuprofen (motrin) is anti-inflammatory and teething causes inflammation this would be my choice. besides it lasts six hours instead of four so a night-time dose would help most of the night. tylenol would wear off in the middle of the night. teething discomfort is normal so only treat it if the child is obviously in discomfort. it is safe to use for long periods of time but avoid over-treating. teething is going to go on for years.
yes you can get pregnant. that is why the implanon has an expiration date. the point where the hormone has depleted. this may be why your period is not normal. use a secondary form of birth control (like a condom) or you will be just taking chances.

maybe a hysterectomy will be the recommendation but surgery isn't always the answer. your doctor will discuss any non-surgical options if reasonable but in the end. the doctor/surgeon will need to prove to your insurance company (the third party payers) that an expensive surgery is required in your case. since i do not know the medical details of your case. only the brief information you have posted. i really have no right to render a patient-specific opinion.

hi just done a bit more searching whats below come from this site www. urologyhealth. org can a change in diet or herbal remedies prevent or cure a yeast infection? scientists do not know why fungal infections develop in some individuals and not others. they also are not sure just how diet might impact the problem or herbal remedies help it. but they do know that diabetic patients have an increased vulnerability to these infections leading them to suggest that anyone diagnosed with diabetes should avoid high carbohydrate diets. yogurt may provide normal microorganisms for the genitourinary tract so many advocate it as a preventative measure or treatment of yeast infections. a few of things i forgot keep out of jeans and slacks same with tights wear just lose cotton knickers go without when you can and shave off your pubic hair this last bit is because yi dose love a nice warm moist area to live in so without any hair you could shut the door to them. and this last bit is from www. yeastinfection. org . those suffering a long time: if youre in the third group youve been suffering for a very long time ten years or more. it feels like youve tried everything under the sun and youve probably spent hundreds maybe even thousands of dollars on products that just dont work. youve lost a ton of money and sadly a huge chunk of your life. ive seen many patients like this over the years and have built my reputation on turning many of these cases around. its what gets me up in the morning and makes me feel excited to be able to give people the opportunity to achieve amazing results at their own hands with the right information and encouragement. if you are in the group of people who hasnt had a diagnosis you probably think im making this up; or at least fluffing up the details a bit. the truth though is that ive spent the past  years of my career as a naturopathic physician talking to thousands of people who feel like their lives have been ruined. these are just a few of the stories ive heard. i wasnt kidding when i said ive heard countless stories just like this – from men and women alike. when a candida overgrowth gets to the point where its wreaking havoc with your entire body you may ultimately become so ill and beat that you just cant seem to function. its difficult to work because you constantly feel fuzzy headed anxious and depressed sick to your stomach and sensitive to just about any food chemical or toxin you come into contact with. its not just adults who are too sick to build their careers further their educations or have fun with family and friends either. a number of the parents ive worked with have brought their children to see me. in some cases i can trace the path of candida in children all the way back to birth. during the birthing process when a baby should be getting nutrients and good bacterial flora from his mother these children contracted yeast instead. instead of growing stronger they remained compromised as their condition worsened with age. and when they became unwell what would the doctor prescribe? you guessed it more antibiotics. these may help as well. good luck
hi frontal lobe lesion is unrelated to your problem on the other hand lesion to your uncus can cause phantosmia i recommend checking you sinus gland also try to recall how it first started was it after sever flu? or nose bleed? did you have chest problems? scaring to your sinus can cause your problem good luck
it sounds like your friend is bothered by the persistent tingling and numbness in his left foot. i understand these sensations can be quite irritating especially if your work involves standing for long periods. did he have these tingling sensations in the same areas before the surgery? if so have these worsened after the surgery or remained the same? i assume his symptoms before the surgery were also on the left side and his hemilaminectomy was also performed on the left side. it will be nice if i could see the preoperative mri images to see what the hemilaminectomy was done for. often if the surgery involves removal of a large herniated disc or the space available for the nerve is very less (stenosis) then the nerve may get bruised during surgery due to retraction. this means that in order to decompress the nerve the surgeon has to retract the nerve to go around the nerve and remove the compressing elements. if the compression is severe the nerve gets bruised easily and there may be persistent numbness and tingling in the areas of the leg and foot that are geographically supplied by that nerve. since the surgeon has advised him to wait it out i assume this is likely the case. swelling of the foot is common if the nerve supplying that area is not fully functional. the weak muscles in the leg and foot are not able to push the blood back up towards the heart and gravity causes this dependent area to swell up. this is often seen at the end of the day and gets better at night when he sleeps. it is difficult to predict how long the tingling will last. it could be a few months. the fact that there is tingling and not pure numbness is actually encouraging although it is more irritating to the patient. if it were a complete nerve injury then only numbness would be experienced. the presence of tingling means that the nerve is just irritated inflamed and swollen due to the bruising. if the tingling is very bothersome he may try some neuralgic pain medications like gabapentin or pregabalin. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (nsaids) may also help in this situation. there is a very rare possibility of other complications like recurrent disc herniation other post-surgical changes irritating the nerve etc. these are difficult to diagnose and usually need a new mri with contrast. however it is advisable to delay such investigation for at least for two to three months after surgery since the mri images at this stage will be obscured by the post surgical changes. if the symptoms of tingling and numbness are progressively worsening and if he develops back pain a new mri may be needed irrespective of the time since surgery to rule out infection or instability. the probable causes:surgical retraction of nerve that may have caused it to bruise. investigations to be done:none if symptoms are not progressively worsening. differential diagnosis:recurrent disc herniation. treatment plan:gabapentin or pregabalin and nsaids. regarding follow up:for further doubts consult a spine surgeon online. ---> <link>

"eczema is genetically dry skin. there is no ""cure"" but there are effective treatments. first be sure that you are dealing with eczema (atopic dermatitis). see a dermatologist if you are not clear. the steps: . moisturization is the key so use a good skin moisturizer -- one without perfumes -- and sue it often. . avoid scratching at all costs since this can lead to secondary skin infection. antihistamines can be used fo control itching. . control inflammation. using hydrocortisone cream (available over the counter) will help. . keep the skin very clean. and cool. warm sweaters (especially wool) will drive eczema crazy. . be patient. controlling eczema takes time. do not hesitate to involve a dermatologist if your home management is not working."
hi such transient episodes can happen due to temporary optic artery blockage or angiospasms. a ct angiography can help rule this out. also a mri brain with contrast will help rule out other causes. thanks
i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. painful knees are no fun! this is something you should have evaluated by a health care provider. you can start with your primary care provider. while it's possible you simply have some arthritis or some inflammation related to doing chores on your knees it's also possible you injured your knee. your symptoms could be caused by a variety of knee injuries including a dislocated kneecap. ouch! the mere fact that you're having severe inflammation shooting pains and burning/stinging sensations indicate you need a physical examination by a health care professional. he or she may want to order some tests such as x-ray or mri to help figure out what's going on. i wish you all the best in getting bck on your feet (literally! ). i have similar issues with my right knee too but not to the extent that you have. on my knee i have permanent inflammation peripheral nerve damage and bursitis. it's the bursitis that causes the sharp stinging pain that you speak of. this quite possibly is your issue. things you can try to help aid the pain and swelling are icing elevating your knee some nsaids and trying to stay off the knee as much as you can. but the best course of action for you is to go to your doctor to see what he/she can do for you due to the extreme problems that you are enduring. here are some articles that i found on webmd that might help you: busitis symptoms bursitis faq's don't forget to make that doctor's appointment and i hope you start feeling better.

that is a difficult question to answer not knowing anything about this child. addressing a child's hygiene habits (or lack of) is difficult some parents but important nonetheless especially if you are the one doing the laundry. have a sit down talk about the importance of bathroom hygiene not just for cleanliness and odor but for medical reasons. stool left on the skin will tend to burn. if she already has irritated skin this could be the reason she doesn't want to wipe now. give her some hydrocortisone ointment and/or a good barrier cream used for diaper rashes to soothe these sore areas. she is old enough to help with the laundry so it may be wise to have her wash her own underwear pointing out that if she wiped better they would be easier to clean. buy her some new undies. some really nice ones but only give them to her when this behavioral problem has been finally solved. be persistent in your efforts but don't punish. often it is best to reward for good or expected behaviors than to overly-punish or embarrass a child for unacceptable behavior.
"there are two kinds of   vaccines being produced and they can both be given to children. the first is a  ""flu shot"" -- an inactivated vaccine (containing killed virus) that is given with a needle usually in the arm. the flu shot is approved for use in people  months of age and older including healthy people people with chronic medical conditions and pregnant women. the second version is the  nasal spray flu vaccine -- a vaccine made with live weakened viruses that do not cause the flu (sometimes called laiv for ""live attenuated influenza vaccine""). the live vaccine is approved for use in healthy people  years to  years of age who are not pregnant."
i think so yes. in addition i have found that if your legs are in good shape because you exercise regulary then it tends to tighten up your pelvic floor muscles to. just my own personal experience of course.
roughly between   and   cells per microliter (one one-thousandth of a milliliter). the white blood cell count is part of a complete blood count (cbc) one of the most common blood tests. automated cell counting machines count the number of cells present in a blood sample. different laboratories use different cell counting machines and each lab may have slightly different values for the normal range. a high white blood cell count (leukocytosis) is most often due to an infection but can occur during many different illnesses. certain medications such as oral corticosteroids also increase the white blood cell count. a low white blood cell count (leukopenia) is less common. certain medications infections inflammatory and autoimmune conditions heavy alcohol use and problems in the bone marrow can cause a low white blood cell count. what is a norml wbc? what is a normal white blood cell count? what is a therapeutic range for a white blood cell count
a heart murmur is a sound created by the flow of blood in the heart heard when listening to the heart with a stethoscope. some heart murmurs called innocent murmurs occur in completely healthy people. heart murmurs also can result when the valves of the heart are diseased creating abnormal blood flow through the valve. people with congenital heart problems (birth defects) or congestive heart failure frequently have heart murmurs. a heart murmur can be a clue to the presence of heart disease. innocent murmurs dont need further testing but unexplained heart murmurs often prompt other tests like electrocardiogram (ecg) or a heart ultrasound (echocardiogram).
hi long term use has caused the drug dependancy withdraw these gradually over the period of  months and you will be fine. maintain adequate hydration. thanks
there are many advantages to dental implants including: improved appearance. dental implants look and feel like your own teeth. and because they are designed to fuse with bone they become permanent. improved speech. with poor-fitting dentures the teeth can slip within the mouth causing you to mumble or slur your words. dental implants allow you to speak without the worry that your teeth might slip. improved comfort. because they become part of you implants eliminate the discomfort of removable dentures. easier eating. sliding dentures can make chewing difficult. dental implants function like your own teeth allowing you to eat your favorite foods with confidence and without pain. improved self-esteem. dental implants can give you back your smile and help you feel better about yourself. improved oral health. dental implants don't require reducing other teeth as a tooth-supported bridge does. because nearby teeth are not altered to support the implant more of your own teeth are left intact improving your long-term oral health. individual implants also allow easier access between teeth improving oral hygiene. durability. implants are very durable and will last many years. with good care many implants last a lifetime. convenience. removable dentures are just that; removable. dental implants eliminate the embarrassing inconvenience of removing your dentures as well as the need for messy adhesives to keep your dentures in place. you are able to chew your food proper and speak correctly. they don't disturb your adjacent teeth like happens in bridges. they are ideal replacement for your missing teeth. if you are considering dental implants then chose the best dental clinic which offers pain-free experience.
i have had no problems with using a numbing agent like orajel with my patients and my own kids. it is one of many things that we have used including cool teething toys moist-chilled washcloths and oral pain meds. i would suggest trying the orajel on your own gums so that you get a sense of how it feels/how long it lasts. it can certainly take the edge off especially for those middle of the night awakenings.

i seriously doubt you will find any doctor willing to do this for you especially steroids (anabolic steroids? ) that you have been able to purchase somewhere else. i don't think there is really any safe steroid regime that would be recommended for a teenager. i would advise you to really look in to the serious side-effects before considering using them.

i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. vicodin (generic name hydrocodone-acetaminophen) shouldn't cause your blood pressure to spike. quite the opposite in fact. pain can cause your blood pressure to go up though so be sure to take enough medication to keep your pain adequately controlled. several things can cause your blood pressure to spike temporarily including needing to urinate (pee). however if your post-operative pressure is consistently above what's normal for you please call your surgeon's office to advise them about what's going on. they need to know. i wish you all the best with this!

the problem with menstrual migraines is that the headaches are driven or caused by the change in hormones with your cycle. the only direct way to change that is with hormone manipulation (like  day oral contraception pills). the migraines can be treated with the normal migraine prevention medications which will not change your hormone levels.
that low-grade fever is nothing to be alarmed about. since some types of pink eye (conjunctivitis) is related to viruses like cold viruses there could be an association since viruses can cause minor temperature elevations. if the eye is unusually swollen or painful then it would be wise to get properly examined but in most cases simple pink eye should not really cause a fever.
i would recommend an evaluation by an otolaryngologist (ear nose and throat specialist) regarding the sinuses. i would make sure to add sun protection daily since most wrinkles are caused by sun exposure over years. if you are sensitive to sunscreen look for chemical free sunscreens. these are not absorbed into the skin and should not have an effect on your sinuses. otherwise i would see your dermatologist about possible in-office procedures to help treat the wrinkles and determine the best approach for you.

"the terrible thing is that you may or may not need any antibiotics. most viral infections are viruses and do not require antibiotics. a few are strep but making a ""self-diagnosis"" based solely on symptoms is not much better than a coin toss. some viral sore throats are mono (mononucleosis). i can't blindly diagnose you over the internet and you may or may not have the skills to accurately diagnose yourself so my recommendation is for you to be tested for strep at student health. a simple rapid test if you do have it then the amoxicillin may be appropriate (assuming you have the proper dose. you didn't share that information) for your weight and severity of infection."
hi just take a break for a week to  days your pain will go faster that way. why your bike riding and doing other exercise your putting strain on it just take the break your body wont mind. when you start back start slow with the exercises and the bike riding if you still have pain take a few more days off its a tricky area to heal but keep off the pain killers if you go back for exercise they will mask the real pain you could end up with more damage and be off longer. hope this helps. good luck

"it is so important that you are in tune to the possibility that your child might be overweight and you should state that very early in your discussion with your child's doctor. so many parents are embarrassed about this topic but they should not be. if you are straightforward about your concern your doctor can get right to the issue and give it the time that it deserves. your doctor should calculate for your child's ""body mass index"" (bmi) which is an easily calculated number based on her height and weight and compare her bmi to other girls her exact age. children in the upper  to  percentiles are labeled ""at risk for obesity "" and children over the  percentile are termed ""obese. "" children classified as at risk should be carefully evaluated. and even though the use of the bmi scale may miss some patients at risk or may classify some unusually muscular children as obese you and your doctor should then use common sense and clinical judgment to avoid incorrect labeling. thereafter other very important factors to consider include the family history and activity level of your child and other health problems your child might be having. then extra time should be taken to go over the complete dietary profile of your child and your family."

hi well i can say your not alone if you google smell under your beasts you can find more info but here are some bits that may help but remember we are what we eat so could be something in there? so there is grapefruit seed extract mix a few drops in water and wash twice daily with it or you could try some cut lemon and wipe the area and let dry they say it should go in a couple of days. ok they say it could be a yeast fungus so your could try dabbing some boric acid powder on the area and you could also try this as well a / teaspoon in a litre of water shake well drink through the day this way you attacking it from both sides if works that way don't worry i take boric acid daily for raynards disease and ed works for both. hope this helps. good luck
hi compared to normal range the count is pretty low. need to get it high for good results. yoga meditation de-stressing and healthy and nutritious diet should help. thanks
it depends on the quality of your current diet. some pescatarians eat dairy and others don't. if you don't eat dairy vitamin d and calcium are of concern. even if you do eat dairy it is likely you need vitamin d unless you are having fatty fish every day. you don't have to worry about omega- (dha and epa) if you are having fatty fish twice a week. you need to be sure you are getting enough iron and zinc but with careful planning it shouldn't be a problem. in short a well-balanced pescatarian diet can supply most of the nutrients you need (except d which is low in food). this article can help you make the right choices. of course you can always take a multivitamin if you feel you diet is inadequate.
yes. this could be a contributing factor and yes you should call your doctor.
"the first thing that came to my mind is ""how long has this been going on for? "" anytime i hear that children have been vomiting for some time or is starting to dry heave my first words are ""call the pediatrician and go to the er""--the child is probably severely dehydrated and probably needs iv fluids. you should not give her pepto-bismol because it is not for vomiting and since this may be a virus you should not use pepto-bismol liquid because one of the ingredients is related to aspirin and is associated with reye's syndrome. pepto-bismol actually has a childrens formulation that contains calcium carbonate instead which is safe to use."
typically you would spot when you are pregnant during implantation. this would happened a few days after ovulation. eight days after your last period is too soon to have this happen.
i think this is a great question. one of the things we learned after hurricane katrina is that a lot of people didn't have emergency kits available at home. some things i would definitely recommend include a bottle of hydrogen peroxide; to help clean out any type of wounds. maybe a triple antibiotic ointment to apply on the wounds after you have actually treated it band aids gauze pads rolled gauze so you can keep the gauze pad in place a flashlight extra batteries a weather radio. some type of fever reducer like tylenol or acetaminophen. maybe a motrin type of product as well. some imodium or pepto-bismol is another item that you may want to include in there along with some plastic latex gloves just in case something happens and you need to protect yourself. those are some of the common items that are found in the emergency kits that are available on the stores today. i would definitely recommend checking the expiration dates. once a year you should always go through that emergency kit as well as your medicine cabinet and check the expiration dates; if anything has expired you want to make sure that you dispose of it properly. in this case we want to make sure that people use the correct method. you want to get a ziploc bag and you want to take the medications and put it into the ziploc bag. you want to take a little bit of water and you want to help it dissolve or you can crush it with like a pot or a hammer. then you want to take something that will make it not very appealing like kitty litter or coffee grinds. put that into the ziploc bag seal it up and put it in the trash. that's the best way. we don't want people to flush medications anymore this is the preferred way now to dispose of medications. but that's a good rule of thumb each year to do.
hi this is more likely to be epileptiform convulsions. consult a neurologist and get a eeg done. thanks
what kind of hormones. there are many different hormones. if you are talking about estrogen (the female hormone) i would say that there is really no reason for any woman of her advanced age to need it but she can certainly talk with her medical provider. i am guessing that the answer will be the same.
wheezing specifically is not a contraindication to getting a flu shot. but depending upon why you are wheezing and what other symptoms you might have your health care provider might advise you to wait until you are feeling better if you are wheezing. moderate to severe illnesses with or without fever are precautions to getting most vaccines. this means that in general it is advisable to wait until the illness is resolved. your healthcare provider can advise as to whether you should get your vaccine or wait. talk to your doctor about your symptoms. for more information on flu vaccination please visit: <link>.
that medicine is okay for anxiety some people do have side effects but that goes along with all medicines. if you are not sure about taking it tell your doctor and they can try something else but you may still have side effects. there are some otc sleeping aids you could try with less side effects but i don't know how bad your anxiety is. you would just have to try and see. and if you just do that many a month you may be okay. but you need to talk to your doctor. hope you find the right thing and get better.
vaginal bleeding during or after sex and at no other times makes me think of trauma to the cervix or vaginal or a lack of lubrication and abrasion of this tissue. an accompanying symptom could be painful sex but this doesn't directly point to either condition. an endometrial polyp could also cause bleeding during sex. your medical history and other signs and symptoms on physical exam will help your doctor determine the cause. however other exams and tests such as an ultrasound may be needed. talk with your partner about your concerns and make an appt to see your gyn. i would talk to my gynecologist if it's that much blood. at first i was thinking lubricant or maybe mild trauma getting overly vigorous but if it's a showstopper then that's another story. then did some looking around and fibroids or polyps could be the culprit and they don't affect a pap smear. i had a polyp once and went through a d&c and never had issues again. with fibroids i hear they can come back. i also read that some of this might be hormonal and since you have had a hysterectomy this might make sense. bottom line i'd go see your gyno. hope this helps.
hi i can see only the hip xray. arm xray has not been uploaded i guess. there is a intracapsulr neck femur fracture at hip and this type of fracture has no other option. it has to be surgically treated by arthoplasty. she wont be able to walk henceforth unless the surgery is performed. anesthesia risks need to be considered. thanks
as you know i have no way of seeing or examining you. i have only your description to go on. one possibility would be a sebaceous cyst ; perhaps a cyst that is secondarily infected. these oil gland cysts are quite common in this area but you will need to see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined and treated. you have had this for a month so it would be in your best interest to check in checked out so you will not have to worry.
"the short answer is: yes. unfortunately you have exposed yourself to genital herpes. it doesn't matter that the cold sore was scabbed over or that the lip lesion ""barely touched"" your penis. a person with herpes can spread the virus even when it's not active. your girlfriend's herpes most definitely was active since she had a lesion. this does not mean you positively will develop genital herpes but you're flirting with disaster. you need to take better precautions in the future. there is no cure for genital herpes. if you do develop genital herpes you absolutely must disclose the fact to your partners before you have sex with them. they have a right to decide whether or not to risk getting the virus from you. and while condom use is good be aware a condom won't necessarily protect you from herpes because the virus can reside in groin areas that aren't covered by the sheath. i'm not sure how old you are but you may want to read this article about the rise in genital herpes transmission among us teens due to having oral sex with an infected partner. even if you're not a teenager the same scenario applies to your story. please stop engaging in unsafe sex. always use a condom. don't have any type of sexual relations with a person who obviously has a virus that can become a sexually transmitted disease. you owe it to yourself and your sexual partners to be responsible about your sexual practices. wishing you well! there r two types of herpes. there r the oral kind and then there is genital kind. yes u can get herpes on your genitals from a cold sore. but even tho it is herpes on your genitals it is not actually the genital type of herpes. it is the oral type actually. u can spread each type to each area. yes her giving u head with a what looks like mainly healed sore can give u herpes. i have kissed a chick with a sore before to and didn't get nothing. some times your just lucky or perhaps your immune system is working harder and better at times i don't know. but u can get on acyclovir twice a day from your doctor it's herpes meds. or if u don't have insurance there is a natural pill for it u can get at health stores or what have u called l-lysine and take it twice a day and have her take it as well. hell even once a day would b good."

"it depends on several things: . your insurance company (some are better than others as you know) . your array of symptoms that are attributed to the deviated nasal septum (surgery would only be approved if this was the only answer) . your ents persistence. the surgeon would need to ""plead your case"" to the cost-conscious insurance company."
most helpful answer i would have waited till the morning that is why its a morning after pill. you should be fine with one pill i have used it a few times in my life and have never ended up pregnant after taking this pill. don't consume to much in a short period of time its not good for you. they are only meant to be used every now and then not every time after sex. bc or condom would be better. when you purchased the pill it should have came in a  pack you take one within  hours and the  one  hours after the  one. good luck to you but you should be fine

for people with very low incomes or no income the law provides financial assistance to make insurance affordable. you may qualify for medicaid coverage which would be virtually no-cost coverage. if you make too much to qualify or you live in a state not expanding its medicaid program you'll likely qualify for subsidies to lower the cost of your insurance. i suggest you check your state's marketplace to begin shopping your options. you can do that at healthcare. gov. if it turns out there are no affordable options available to you (medicaid isn't expanding in your state or there is no health plan costing less than % of your income) you will not be penalized for not having coverage.

i understand that your living arrangements are not optimum but personally i would not want to sleep in a room with a kitty litter box. cats and their feces can carry a lot of bacteria to your new baby. because they are very curious they will be walking and contaminating surfaces used by the baby and even jumping in the crib. i know you love your cats but you have a bigger commitment to your newborn. perhaps you can find a temporary home for your cats until your apartment is ready or ask you dad to bend his litter box rule a bit until you move. cats and babies can co-exist but both will require very careful supervision and babies do come first. thank you for your advice but you didn't really answer my question as to if it poses a health risk to have them together?

"a person with a positive skin test a normal chest x-ray and no symptoms most likely has only a few tb germs in an inactive state and is not contagious. nevertheless treatment with an antibiotic may be recommended for this person to prevent the tb from turning into an active infection. the antibiotic used for this purpose is called isoniazid. if taken for six to  months it will prevent the tb from becoming active in the future. in fact if a person with a positive skin test does not take inh there is a %-% lifelong risk that the tb will become active. taking isoniazid can be inadvisable (contraindicated) during pregnancy or for those with alcoholism or liver disease. also isoniazid can have side effects. the side effects occur infrequently but a rash can develop and the patient can feel tired or irritable. liver damage from isoniazid is a rare occurrence and typically reverses once the drug is stopped. very rarely however especially in older people the liver damage (inh hepatitis) can even be fatal. it is important therefore for the doctor to monitor a patient's liver by periodically ordering blood tests called ""liver function tests"" during the course of inh therapy. another side effect of inh is a decreased sensation in the extremities referred to as a peripheral neuropathy. this can be avoided by taking vitamin  (pyridoxine) and this is often prescribed along with inh. a person with a positive skin test along with an abnormal chest x-ray and sputum evidencing tb bacteria has active tb and is contagious. active tb usually is accompanied by symptoms such as a cough fever weight loss and fatigue. active tb is treated with a combination of medications along with isoniazid. rifampin (rifadin) ethambutol (myambutol) and pyrazinamide are the drugs commonly used to treat active tb in conjunction with isoniazid (inh). four drugs are often taken for the first two months of therapy to help kill any potentially resistant strains of bacteria. then the number is usually reduced to two drugs for the remainder of the treatment based on drug sensitivity testing that is usually available by this time in the course. streptomycin a drug that is given by injection may be used as well particularly when the disease is extensive and/or the patients do not take their oral medications reliably (termed ""poor compliance""). treatment usually lasts for many months and sometimes for years. successful treatment of tb is dependent largely on the compliance of the patient. indeed the failure of a patient to take the medications is the most important cause of failure to cure the tb infection. in some locations the health department demands direct monitoring of patient compliance with therapy. surgery on the lungs may be indicated to help cure tb when medication has failed but in this day and age surgery for tb is unusual. treatment with appropriate antibiotics will usually cure the tb. without treatment however tuberculosis can be a lethal infection. therefore early diagnosis is important. those individuals who have been exposed to a person with tb or suspect that they have been should be examined by a doctor for signs of tb and screened with a tb skin test."

"here are some helpful hints from the men and women who are the gold medal winners in the longevity marathon of life: ) centenarians use their body reserves well. at birth you actually have excess capacity built into your body tissues organs and biological systems. this reserve declines gradually over time. the goal is to slow down this decrease in reserve. youll never guess how. yep were back to healthy lifestyle habits. you need to know that this decline can be insidious. that means you can actually lose most of an organs function before you actually experience symptoms. studies of the centenarians show that they tend to be more physically active throughout each day. they eat simply but tend to stick to whole foods. processed refined products are not a staple. ) gerontologists have noted that you can make improvements in your lifestyle at any point in your lifespan and reap terrific benefits. if you begin to walk on a regular basis in your mid s researchers have found that you can delay immobility to age  and beyond. get up and move already! aim to accrue   steps every day you can. ) use it and you wont lose it. scientists from the national institute of aging once noted that much of what we thought were the symptoms of aging are actually the symptoms of disuse. if you dont use it you lose it. this applies to your physical as well as mental muscle. of course muscle strength declines with age. outside of athletes most of you will reach your peak muscle performance somewhere between the ages of  and . again because of that body reserve if you stay physically active you shouldnt experience significant muscular incapacity until your s or s. add strength training to your physical activity routine now. if you do youll be able to stay physically independent and avoid disability and frailty. and whip out your sudoku and puzzles to keep your mind fresh and focused. ) optimize your genes. ive got a reality blast for all of you folks who may be saying oh heck my grandmother and mom lived well into their s. i have great genes and i dont have to try hard to live long.  science shows that only about -% of longevity is genetically determined. lifestyle is the critical factor. you can really make a significant impact on living long and well when you improve lifestyle habits. ) wit passion and social connections keep you young. researchers with the new england centenarian study note that the majority of centenarians continue to do things they love (hey dont knock knitting; it works! ) theyre often fun and feisty and they cherish and maintain social connections to family friends and their communities. whatever age you are today make sure youre living a life rich with people you love to be around and that youre out there doing professional work and hobbies for which you have a real passion. ) aim to be a stress shedder.  dr. tom perls one of the top centenarian researchers noted in his book ""how to live to be  "" that the men and women he studied were stress shedders.  in other words they experience whatever stress occurs adapt and adjust and then move on. they dont tend to drag the drama and trauma of lifes stresses around with them. this relieves them of mental weight and allows them to get on with embracing and enjoying life."

if your babys growth has been fine for the gestational age then it would suggest that baby has been doing pretty well. if a hand/hands of your baby are open on an ultrasound it is a great indication that it is not . babies with  cannot open their hands normally. if worried you may consider getting another ultrasound scan done to thoroughly look for other features or markers suggestive of chromosomal abnormalities. getting amniocentesis done would also help to confirm or rule out genetic problems in baby. discuss with your treating doctor/gynecologist or genetic specialist for further clarification and assistance. take care.

okay - first you need to understand that periods can change especially as you get older with more stress more sex ect. the brown discharge is probably old blood and seeing as you said it had been  days that may explain why it is brown and spotting - and it can last several days after your period. pulling out is not a guarantee method of birth control (not that i am saying anything else is guaranteed) you maybe pregnant some women have their first period after conceiving. ovarian cyst are also maybe a possibility and any chance of toxic shock syndrome? but chances are it is just an abnormal period. if it continues or you start to have pain or new symptoms the only safe bet is to call your obgyn. good luck!

"the most definitive symptom of bipolar disorder is alternating cycles of mania and depression. in the manic phase behaviors include: dramatic increase in energy with a decreased need for sleep. racing thoughts that are sometimes expressed during rapid-fire conversation. feelings of being ""high"" or euphoric -- as if they could do almost anything. easy distractibility and sometimes irritability. poor judgment -- for example purchasing things one can't afford or use. an increased need for sex and reckless sexual behaviors. alcohol or drug abuse particularly cocaine and sleeping pills. aggressive behavior sometimes provocative. denial that anything is wrong or different. in the depressive stage behaviors can include: persistent sadness anxiety or a feeling of ""emptiness.

i answered your previous question. you are really concerned about these things so i will address a few more of your concerns: the nutrients that you may lose ejaculating is negligible. only a few calories. you will not become nutrient deficient from masturbating nor do you need to take any vitamin or mineral supplements. you do not lose testosterone when you masturbate. as a matter of fact part of your urge to masturbate has a bit to do with your high testosterone level. your testosterone level is safe. to sum up: you will not stunt your growth grow hair on your palms or end up in a mental institution from masturbation. masturbation is safe. much safer than sex (and more convenient).
some prenatal vitamins can cause nausea in an already nauseous pregnant woman. if your prenatal vitamins make you sick talk to your general practitioner. he or she may be able to prescribe a different kind of prenatal vitamin (for example chewable or liquid vitamins as opposed to those you swallow whole may be better tolerated by some women).
feeling unusually fatigued is an early pregnancy symptom that can occur as soon as one week after you conceive. the excessive tiredness is often related to a high level of progesterone in your system although other things such as lower levels of blood sugar lower blood pressure and increased blood production can all contribute. fatigue not related to pregnancy can be caused by stress physical exhaustion depression a common cold or flu or other illnesses. if your fatigue is related to pregnancy it's important to make sure you get plenty of rest; eating foods that are rich in protein and iron can help offset it.

i love fish. i think its one of the quickest and easiest dinners to make and also from what i gather one of the most intimidating. i know people that will never make it for fear of ruining it. on the other side i know people who dont cook it because they have had so much overcooked or fishy-tasting fish that they think they dont like it. i want to encourage you to not be freaked out by fish and get a few tips to add it into your weeknight meals. and if youre already cooking it these tips may add some ease to cooking or give you some new inspiration.  tips to great fish . buy your fish from a fish counter whenever possible. many grocery stores have fishmongers who can tell you what is freshest. if you want a mild flavor stick to wild fish and fresh not frozen. . use a high heat and cook quick! a piece of fish that is under-a-half-inch thick will cook under a broiler on high in less than five minutes. . use citrus and herbs as finishing flavors. just by squeezing fresh lemon juice at the end and topping with chopped fresh basil cilantro dill or mint you can have gourmet-tasting fish in seconds! . use spice rubs. many spice rubs for chicken or beef work great on fish. . top with fruit salsas. mango and lime pineapple and cilantro or peach and basil. finely chop fruit add an herb some extra virgin olive oil finely diced onion or shallot lemon or lime salt and pepper. you will wow yourself and your guests. remember to look for fish that are high in omega- (salmon pollock sole flounder shrimp and catfish) and try to avoid ones high in mercury (swordfish and shark) and other contaminates. a good resource is the seafood watch guide from the monterey bay aquarium. this will bring you to seafood guides that are regional so you can follow this based on where you live — northeast southwest etc.
in the past celiac disease was considered to be a disease primarily of infants and children. it is now clear that initial signs and symptoms of celiac disease can occur in adults and even in the elderly. symptoms in infants infants with celiac disease typically have diarrhea steatorrhea abdominal cramps abdominal distension irritability muscle wasting and failure to thrive and grow. these symptoms typically occur after the introduction of gluten-containing cereals into their diets. symptoms in children children with celiac disease typically have diarrhea increased amounts of fat in the stool (steatorrhea) flatulence (passing gas) short stature and weight loss. proper treatment with a gluten-free diet can lead to accelerated (catch-up) growth in height; however if untreated childhood celiac disease can result in short stature as an adult. as children with celiac disease enter adolescence many will experience spontaneous remissions (reduced symptoms) and remain free of the signs and symptoms of celiac disease until later in adulthood. this later reactivation can be precipitated by stress such as pregnancy or surgery. symptoms in adults adults with celiac disease may have symptoms of diarrhea steatorrhea weight loss and flatulence; however many adults do not have diarrhea or steatorrhea. they have either no symptoms or only vague abdominal discomfort such as bloating abdominal distension and excess gas. they also may have only one or a few signs of malnutrition such as iron deficiency anemia abnormal bleeding or bone fractures. some individuals with celiac disease and gastrointestinal symptoms are mistakenly diagnosed to have irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). there have been changes during the past  years in the way in which celiac disease is diagnosed. the average age at which celiac disease is diagnosed has increased probably because of the increased awareness that the disease can first cause symptoms or signs in adults. whereas in the past diarrhea was the initial symptom in % of patients it now is the initial symptom in only %. a small proportion of patients - about % - are now diagnosed with blood antibody tests because they have a close relative with celiac disease and they are being screened to see if they also have the disease.

"doctors usually define diarrhea as a significant increase in the total weight of stool passed in a single day. most people however think of diarrhea as an illness during which they have more frequent loose watery stools. almost everyone has diarrhea at some point in his or her life. in developing countries where illnesses that cause diarrhea are more common and where health care is less readily available diarrhea is a major health concern because of its potential to cause severe life-threatening dehydration. infants and the elderly are more prone to dehydration from diarrhea. diarrhea that comes on suddenly and goes away over a period of a couple of weeks is usually referred to as ""acute diarrhea. "" most people with acute diarrhea recover on their own. diarrhea that lasts more than four weeks is thought of as ""chronic diarrhea. "" typically chronic diarrhea requires medical care to find the underlying cause and treat complications such as dehydration."

"i'm sorry your mother is going through this and hope the ulcer heals soon. what your doctor called a ""bleeding ulcer"" is usually called a "" peptic ulcer "" today. the likely reason the doctor called this a ""stress ulcer"" is because it used to be thought that mental or emotional stress caused an increase in the production of stomach acid which in turn could eat through a small area of the stomach lining and cause an ulcer (which is a little sore on the inside of the stomach or intestine). however there's no real scientific evidence to support the theory that mental stress causes an increase in stomach acid that leads to ulcers. this relationship may exist but it's not proven. it's still being investigated. that said if your mother is under a lot of stress in her life she owes it to herself to engage in some stress reduction activities. simple things like taking five minutes to close her eyes and focus on deep breathing exercises can help reduce stress levels. physical activity also is a great stress management tool. listening to music praying or meditating going for a walk -- any or all of these things can reduce the body's physical response to mental stress. if your mom needs help with stress management she can find many resources on the internet. wishing you both well!"
"a lot depends on why your quality is low. i think you mean something other than a contraceptive when you talk about this ""wellman"" product because contraceptive means that it would prevent pregnancy. some men have poor quality sperm if their testes are too warm for too long. are you either wearing no underwear or wearing boxers? i know you say your diet is good but are you getting a little fat every day and eating plenty of fruits and vegetables and protein? you want to find out what is affecting your quality and fix that if you can."
is there any redness or inflammation. ?
the significant pain and i would assume stiffness may be a symptom of a type of arthritis. unfortunately both osteoarthritis (degenerative) and certain types of inflammatory arthritis (things like rheumatoid arthritis) can cause morning pain and stiffness. in general the pain from inflammatory arthritis lasts longer usually over an hour than degenerative arthritis but it can vary. also degenerative conditions often hurt again at the end of the day or after being sedentary for long periods of time like a long car ride. . given the severity of your symptoms i would suggest scheduling a visit with your pcp and discussing this problem. he or she may want to get some x-rays or diagnostic lab tests to try and help sort this out. . (it could be) either the onset of some age-related arthritis or inflammatory arthritis.
actually your girl can get pregnant even though you're pulling out ejaculating and then cleaning off your penis. men emit seminal fluid prior to ejaculation and this fluid can contain sperm -- which can fertilize an egg if one is present. withdrawal (pulling out) is not considered an effective form of birth control. if you desire to avoid pregnancy (and also sexually transmitted diseases) you should consider using a condom whenever you have sex. used correctly a condom is a very effective form of birth control. see this article on how to use a condom. hope this helps!

hi. if a woman has a cycle of  days then on about   day the egg releases. so the period between  to  day is most favourable. your friend had intercourse during that period only and there are chances of pregnancy. but if she has a severe bleed then it is not probably pregnancy. so for confirmation she should get her hcg levels checked by a blood test and also get an ultrasound done. hope this helps.
"i'm going to say if your health care provider feels aspirin (asa) is sufficient for your blood thinning needs then i'd go with that assessment. your health care provider is in the best position to judge the situation because he or she knows your complete medical history. in general it's not unusual to step down from a ""big gun"" blood thinner like warfarin (coumadin) at some point after a person has experienced a pulmonary embolism (pe). this is because the pe likely has stabilized by now (that is you haven't had more symptoms that would indicate the pe has gotten larger) and now you only need an anticoagulant (blood thinner) to help prevent another clot. aspirin therapy works quite well for this purpose. hope this helps set your mind at ease!"
hi this is a visual thing you really need to see your own doctor on this one and do explain how you come by them. good luck
it would not be prudent or even possible to determine if someone was experiencing a stroke blindly over the internet. strokes are unilateral (one sided) and severe daily foot or leg cramping are not signs one would experience. these symptoms could indicate vascular problems or even neurological disorders however so they deserve a complete evaluation by your medical provider. expect some diagnostic tests; including blood tests and perhaps a low back x-ray or doppler imaging studies of your lower extremities if your medical provider feels these tests are necessary. never underestimate the wisdom of your bodies to give us warning signs so please do not ignore these symptoms.
hi this can be early sciatica or a pinched nerve in lower lumbar spine. an mri of lumbar spine is indicated to make a diagnosis. local hot fomentation and gel application can be tried if pain is more. thanks
a colonoscopy goes further up the colon to look for precancerous polyps and requires sedation - performed at a surgery center in most cases. a sigmoidoscopy only sees the most distal part of the colon is usually done in the office. the colonoscopy is the preferred test.
hi i recommend you see a gynecologist for possible ovarian cysts ultrasonography is recommended. good luck
i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder with major highs (euphoria) appx  years ago that co-occured with adult adhd aggressive personality and anger issues. i was medicated with lamicta serquel and adderall. needless to say i was on a roller coaster and after a while no longer desired medical help. over the last  years i've slipped off into a whirl wind of mental problems. i have now encountered high blood pressure tmj panic attacks multiple fractures in my lower limbs (without known cause) due to avascular necrosis which is medical terms for death of bone i also over the last  / years had constant headaches with up to as many as  migraines (go to the er type) a month i do not sleep well and grind my teeth in return broken them i have unexplained pains and aches throughout most of my body on a daily bases some that go as quickly as they came my outburst are  worse now than ever. mostly in the evening time when my children and husband get home my reproductive system after stopping treatment failed and unfortunately after  cyst were removed and my sons premature birth i was basically pushed into having a partial hystercotomy i have sinus infections around every - weeks with  known cyst in my left sinus cavities. i just recently (last week) went back to my dr a new one and briefly told her what my issues were and how i havent been treated in several years. she has started me on a low dose of adderall again and recommended i see a specialist to combine biopolar treatment. she doesnt know my deepest struggles or demons and i've learned to mask my problems around strangers if possible so answering her questionnaire was simple as not being quite honest due to my own fears of being judged. bipolar affected my grandmother my aunt one of my cousins. i'd say my mother is borderline and my younger brother is. i unfortunately see it in my daughter who is only  and my oldest son who is nearly  is hard to tell cause he is adhd but i believe it is masking bipolar because he is very depressed alot but also has been through some tough stuff with me and other problems. i have found that i turn to other releases due to pain management of other physical issues though i feel okay for an hour or so any pain meds prescribed to me tend to accelerate my mood swings and i've found them to be addicting mentally though i never intended to use them for other than my multiple breaks. my adderall definitely intensifies panic mainly in the evening. but its ultimately a huge help for the morning due to shuffling kids and my husband and i own our own company. i cant work with the public due to this nor be in social situations. my marriage has been a disaster for atleast  / years and it is me but now my husband has became moody as well and i do whole heartedly believe it started due to my mental problems. i do not at the moment take anything other than my adderall and pain meds for my fractures and honestly decided today i dont really think adderall is the best thing unless im treated with something else for the moods. i still have to make an appt with a specialized dr and treatment will take quite sometime because of my fear of drs due to years back when all this started they put me on so so so many different meds i felt like a lab rat and nothing seemed to truly work and i dont really honestly open up to a dr. i will never tell them about my addictions nor will i ever tell them my increased thoughts of suicide. many things can co-exist with bipolar. mimic it. mask it. and everyone is different. it is a horrible disease unfortunately and is something when you hit rock bottom if you have the courage and will to get help you will. if you are like me you'll ruin everything you have because of fear. and honestly this is the first time i've truly opened up about certain things i feel or that i have associated with my bipolar. some may see these things or believe i experience these things but i do not truly discuss them with anyone not my mother. my husband (most i do) or my dr.
sounds like ringworm. i teach martial arts so i see it on a weekly basis. unfortunately.
testosterone can cause pain at the injection site and other symptoms but it's not injected into the penis. peyronie's disease is a condition that leads to deformities of the shaft of the penis. a curved penis or lumps/nodules along the shaft is often what is seen on exam. and so you may want to see your urologist. it's more common that you think. men who don't engage in sex may not realize that the deformities/lumps exist since this is often not seen in a flaccid penis. in some men this condition can cause pain difficulty with sex and erectile dysfunction. while genetics and trauma have some association to peyronie's disease the exact cause of this condition is not known. there are medications to treat the symptoms associated with the condition. these include medications or surgery in severe cases.
"saline gargles (a weak salt solution of / tsp of salt to  oz of water) used as a gargle will help sooth a sore throat and loosen any exudate (that ""white stuff"") that often accumulates on or around the tonsils. most people tend to overdo the salt part. making it too strong to tolerate."
you probably are paranoid if the test are negative however a female can still have a period while pregnant. this is a result of very low hcg counts. if a female has periods and negative test without any other symptoms she is probably not pregnant but if the other symptoms appear sore breast enlarged abdomen nausea and vomiting etc then the blood test are advised and next a vaginal ultrasound.
 anchors are ideal if your tear was a large one. medium tears can be sutured strongly with  anchors. we need to know the size of the tear that you had before the surgery to comment on the surgical procedure. about the broken anchor if its embedded strongly in the bone and is immobile then do not worry. only if it loosens it needs attention and subsequent removal
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (including ibuprofen) may rarely increase the risk for a heart attack or stroke. the risk may be greater if you have heart disease or increased risk for heart disease (for example due to smoking family history of heart disease or conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes) or with longer use. this drug should not be taken right before or after heart bypass surgery (cabg). this drug may infrequently cause serious (rarely fatal) bleeding from the stomach or intestines. this effect can occur without warning at any time while taking this drug. older adults may be at higher risk for this effect. stop taking ibuprofen and get medical help right away if you notice any of these rare but serious side effects: black/tarry stools persistent stomach/abdominal pain vomit that looks like coffee grounds chest/jaw/left arm pain shortness of breath unusual sweating confusion weakness on one side of the body slurred speech sudden vision changes. talk to your doctor or pharmacist about the benefits and risks of taking this drug.
hi this seems to be a mix problem related to hematology and cardiovascular system secondarily affecting the respiratory system. you need a detailed evaluation of all these systems to come to a proper diagnosis.  echo ekg hrct chest spirometry and bone marrow examination will be valuable. thanks

tests to help your doctor see if colorectal cancer has metastasized or recurred include: an abdominal ultrasound to find the cause of pain or swelling in your abdomen. a colonoscopy to see if cancer has returned to your intestine. blood tests to find out if cancer has returned ( cea ) or to find the cause of symptoms such as weakness fatigue fever bruising or weight loss ( complete blood count and blood profile ). a chest x-ray to find the cause of symptoms such as persistent coughing coughing up blood chest pain or difficult breathing. a ct scan mri or pet scan to see if colorectal cancer has spread into the chest or organs in the abdomen or pelvis. a brain ct scan or mri to look into symptoms such as confusion paralysis numbness vision problems vertigo or headaches. a biopsy such as a liver biopsy or a lung biopsy to find out where the cancer cells have spread. a bone scan to find out whether cancer cells have spread to the bones. what to think about colorectal cancer often comes back even after successful treatment. if you had colorectal cancer in the past pay close attention to your body and see your doctor regularly. tell your doctor about any changes such as decreased appetite bloating or an increase in the size of your belly. your cancer may return even if you do everything you can to prevent it. if this happens focus on what you and your doctor can do to treat your symptoms to help you feel better and live longer. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.
"this question doesn't have a straightforward answer unfortunately. the active ingredient in marijuana is called delta--tetrahydrocannabinol or ""thc"" for short. when a person smokes marijuana the thc is rapidly absorbed by the body which causes the person to feel ""high. "" this effect is short-lived lasting maybe three or four hours. however an inactive form of thc (called delta thc-acid) deposits itself in the fatty tissue. this is called the ""metabolite"" of thc. many marijuana tests don't look for active thc in the blood stream or urine. instead they look for this thc metabolite. despite a common belief that it takes longer for heavy pot users to ""test clean"" than someone who smoked marijuana just one time there isn't much scientific evidence to support that idea. every individual's body is unique. some people's bodies may clear the thc metabolite more rapidly than others. detecting thc depends on the type of test used also. some very sensitive tests can measure delta thc-acid levels up to  days after the person stopped using marijuana. while it would be nice to have a solid answer to the question of how long thc stays in your system after smoking marijuana it's just not possible to say with certainty."
why would you want to take two antihistamines. you may want to talk to a doctor and get a stronger prescription antihistamine if either of these are not very effective for you.
"it depends how long after actual ovulation. if one knows the actual date of ovulation conception can occur up to  hours after ovulation as sperm can live inside the cervix for up to  hours under ideal conditions. an oocyte/egg has at least a  hour lifespan after ovulation. as you may know the most likely time to conceive is about  days before the start of your next period. so if one had a regular  day cycle ovulation is around day ; a regular  day cycle will have an ovulation around day . if one has a regular  day cycle ovulation can be as early as cycle day . the problem arises among women who have periods/bleeds which are not linked to an ovulation. these ""non-ovulatory bleeds"" can occur randomly as the too thick lining of the uterus begins to shed on its own. the woman in this case could have a bleed and then an ovulation anytime thereafter. an even more risky scenario would be the women who mistakes bleeding associated with the release of an egg/oocyte as a period. in that case she could get pregnant from intercourse during her ""supposed period"" because she is actually at a very fertile time. bottom line getting pregnant during a ""real"" period is unlikely--especially if it has been  days since ovulation occurred. if  do a reliable pregnancy test about two weeks after the date of intercourse. a urine test should be reliable around the time of  expected period. lastly if a woman is really scared about having an unplanned pregnancy the worry can cause her flow to be late. . a urine pregnancy test can help resolve any concerns. yes"
my jaw hurt as well as my throat on the left side but the pain soon subsided breifly. that thursday there was hardly any pain but around  pm. there was so much pressure on my jaw that i walked into my house with tears rolling down my face. i tried a warm bath submerging my face and ears in the water because my ears felt like they were bleeding and being jabbed with needles as they did when i went to the nurse the first time. i tried to gargle salt water drink hot drinks cold drinks ice heat pads alternating tylenol and ibuprofen nothing was helping. friday morning i woke my mom up still crying because of the terrible pain and she took me to a family clinic. i couldn't open my mouth enough for them to look inside but they did look in my ear and said it was fine that it was pain from my throat. they gave me a shot of penicillin and  tylenol . i've been taking the tylenol  every  hours as prescribed and the pain never lets up. i dont think the penicillin hasn't kicked in and it has been over  hours. my jaw is still causing me a lot of pain and i still cannot open my mouth! please help me!
one of the questions i have for this patient is they state that they have congestion. so i am questioning as to why they are using an antihistamine such as benadryl or zyrtec. in the case of a congestion patient you want to use things like in a pregnancy patient especially things like a saline nasal spray you don't want to use a sudafed containing product because those aren't exactly for approve for use in a pregnant woman. but if she has like itchy eyes or things like that then we want to make sure that the doctor healthcare providers or where the fact that she is having these symptoms. she may have actually using too much of a combination product for too many things that she really didn't have. if she is not sneezing. or she doesn't have a runny nose and she doesn't feel like there is a drip running down the back of her throat causing a cough there really isn't need for her to take benadryl. so as a pharmacist i am going to ask her a few more questions including the fact of where is she in her pregnancy how long has she had these symptoms for and what are her symptoms and she may end up needing no product at all.
i had the same thing and the only solution i ever found was low dose birth control pills. it generally gets worse as your estrogen/androgen levels shift as you age so many times low dose hormone therapy is the solution. this kind of acne can also be a sign of ovarian cysts so it would be a good idea to chat with your gynecologist just to rule that out.
unfortunately it is not possible to carry a pregnancy without a uterus. however there are many options out there that can allow you to have a family still!

many doctors and pharmacists suggest over-the-counter antacids for occasional heartburn. if heartburn symptoms persist your doctor may suggest drugs such as aciphex prevacid kapidex prilosec protonix nexium or zegerid to reduce the stomach's production of acid or reglan to make the stomach empty itself faster. your pharmacist or your doctor can explain how each drug works and what to expect.
cancer-related fatigue is one of the most common side effects of cancer and its treatment. the exact reason for this fatigue is unknown but it may be related to the disease process or its treatments. to combat fatigue follow these suggestions: evaluate your energy level. keep a diary for one week to identify the time of day when you are either most fatigued or have the most energy. be alert to your personal warning signs of fatigue such as difficulty in concentrating body aches and pains and feelings of exhaustion. conserve energy by planning ahead and organizing your work scheduling rest and pacing yourself. maintain good nutrition. exercise. regular moderate exercise can decrease feelings of fatigue help you stay active and increase your energy. manage stress by adjusting your expectations practicing relaxation techniques and participating in activities that divert your attention away from fatigue. talk to your doctors. there are times when fatigue may be a clue to an underlying medical problem. other times there may be medical interventions to assist in controlling some of the causes of fatigue.
"maybe it means what you want a baby. simple as that. i don't know anything about you or your circumstances but i think it would be normal to have those feelings. if you need a ""baby fix"" try hanging out or babysitting for others who have babies or volunteer at the hospital -- many will take volunteers to help in the children's ward or just rocking the newborns in the nursery. or. you can go out and get pregnant (assuming (a) you are a female and (b) you are ready and capable of starting a family. this is a big decision that should be not be taken lightly."
the best answer to your question is this: call your surgeon's office and ask. if the boil is not located anywhere near the surgical area the surgeon probably will simply proceed with the surgery. but that's his or her decison and the sooner you alert the office to this development the better it will be for everyone. if the boil is located in the surgical area it still may not be a problem. in fact the surgeon may decide to remove the boil during the surgery. it all depends on what type of surgery you're having and in what area of the body. but anyway as i said the best thing you can do is call your surgeon's office and let them know. surgical scheduling is an art all unto itself and if your case has to be delayed it's better for the surgeon's scheduler to know about it as far in advance as possible. wishing you all the best!
any doctor will tell you do not use a medication if it is expired. even otc meds. i used to work in the medical field i will say things were more strict back then but expired drugs hasn't changed much. hope this helps.
"this is a very interesting question. thank you for asking! i can think of one very good reason why you might experience these symptoms while engaging in a competitive gaming situation: the fight-or-flight response. when you are competing you probably feel stressed. you want to win! and you are very highly focused on performing well. this combination of factors could stimulate your sympathetic nervous system (sns) to respond. the sns responds to acute stress by producing a series of changes within your body often call the ""fight or flight response. "" during fight-or-flight your pupils dilate to better allow light into the eye and assess escape routes (or in your case see the video field better); your breathing accelerates; your heart rate increases; your blood pressure rises; your digestive processes slow way down; and your bladder sphincter may suddenly relax (oops! ). important to our discussion though is the fact the sns stress response diverts blood flow from the extremities to the muscles. this is probably the reason your hands and feet become cold -- your sns is diverting that blood to your core and to the large muscles of your body in case you must jump up and run away from whatever danger your brain has perceived. fight-or-flight is a primal reaction so the ""threat"" your sns is responding to could be the competition or the action occurring in the video game itself. when the sns kicks in you usually feel an adrenalin rush. the sns causes your body to be flooded with other hormones too including testosterone and cortisol. if you feel that an sns response is in fact responsible for your cold hands and feet while gaming you can take steps to address the problem. try meditating for several minutes before a competition. focus on your breathing and keep it slow and regulated. if possible focus on your breathing during the competition too. you may be surprised to discover how much you can control your body's response to stress. wishing you well!"

if they have some leftover darvocet i would not recommend taking that. we also want to make sure that people understand that they should not be saving medications and keeping them in their cabinets for a rainy day. they need to dispose off them so therefore there is no risk of possible poisonings or teen drug abuse. so one of the things we recommend now is disposing of your medications but not flushing them down the toilet. there is a new procedure that's very easy to follow and all it requires is a ziploc bag. get a ziploc bag and pour the medication into it. put a little water into it to help it dissolve. you may want to crush it; take a hammer or a mallet and actually make sure it dissolves even more. then take something like kitty litter or coffee grinds or sawdust and put it in the bag to make it very unattractive. zip up the bag and put it in the trash it's that easy. why is it so important that we want to get rid of our medications? because unfortunately today teen drug abuse has really become a big problem especially in pain medications. we find out that teens are going to their medicine cabinets right in their house and taking extra medications that were not used anymore.
this is a tricky question to answer because every person metabolizes (breaks down and eliminates) medications and other substances at different rates. sex body mass and other factors also can influence how fast a person clears any given substance from the body. for example a person with decreased liver or kidney function may metabolize a substance more slowly than someone else. when it comes to marijuana the amount you smoke may affect how quickly the active ingredient (thc) may be detectable in the blood for longer periods of time among heavier smokers than among occasional smokers. in general blood testing for marijuana (thc) is performed to measure impairment such as in driving while under the influence cases. some experts say marijuana is detectable in the blood for up to a week among regular smokers. despite the legalization of recreational and medical marijuana in some states you should understand the effects of marijuana usage on your body and you should never ever drive after using marijuana. reaction times can be severely impaired after using marijuana which makes driving unsafe for yourself and everyone else on the road. please make smart choices about your health! wishing you well! order % legit n safe medical marijuana pain relievers cbd oils dabs and more. for more info text () - lisanblakeretailshop@gmail. com medical marijuana is good for your health top medical strains for all patients suffering from depression glaucoma anxiety and tension headaches chronic pain and nausea mental and physical fatigue and for calming aromatherapy then you are in the right place to look in our meds all top grade aa+ with high level of cbd and thc contact for your supply and good health. pain killers medical marijuana act. lean ***(( no prescribtion is needed))) bud seeds harsh oils dabs & other m. m treatments. we also sefely and securely deliver all sorts of generic medication and syrup nationwide at very good prices. no prescribtions needed. legit verified and reputed plug. available in the u. s canada australia and the uk. for more info text () - lisanblakeretailshop@gmail. com. thank you. sdsd
t his article on webmd explains the science and that yes websites and blogs tend to focus on the diet soda and weight gain and weight gain angle even though the evidence is scant. studies show that when used with a reduced calorie diet non-caloric drinks help people lose weight. there is some concern that regular diet soda consumption increases the risk for heart disease and stroke. but more studies are needed to confirm a relationship. if you find it works for you then that's all that counts. just keep an eye out for research on the health effects. good luck!

epilepsy is a disorder that is primarily diagnosed by history (the character of the episodes) and complemented by the results of other tests such as an mri and eeg. in over half of the cases no cause of the epilepsy is found. for most patients genetic testing is not helpful. there are rare cases of epilepsy where the cause is identified through genetic testing but it is not recommended for the great majority of individuals with epilepsy.
hi. actually anxiety and blood pressure ahs no direct relation to your abdominal discomfort. anxiety in long term can cause high sympathetic activity though causing irregular bowel habits. but pain in abdomen should not occur even due to anxiety. i suggest you take pro biotic tablets daily to normalise your gut movements. if this doesnt help get usg abdomen done and consult a gastroenterologist thanks

just wondering if he has ever had any problems with his heart. that was the first thing that came to mind when i read your comment. could be something more simple though. i would keep trying to find out what is wrong. i would get a second or even third opinon if needed. <positive_smiley>
whether or not your partner has infected you with genital herpes depends on whether you have always practiced safe sex for one thing. also it may depend on how long you've been sexually intimate with each other. if you've had sex only once or twice and if you used a condom each time your risk of getting genital herpes is lower than if you've had unprotected sex for a long time. but you could have been infected during any one encounter. don't think you're in the clear because you've never seen herpes sores on your partner's genitals or your own. the symptoms of genital herpes are often subtle and easily mistaken for something else like bug bites pimples razor burn or hemorrhoids. what's more the virus can be contagious even when there are no symptoms.
"this is an excellent question - and one you should ask the surgeon who performed the breast reduction. when i served as a reconstructive surgery nurse the doctor i worked with recommended a new baseline mammogram  months after breast reduction surgery. breast reduction surgery changes the ""architecture"" of your breasts and causes scar tissue deposits to develop so it's important to establish a new baseline image for a radiologist to compare your results against in the future. by the six-month post-surgical mark all of the absorbable suture should have dissolved and not appear on the mammo image. also you should be sufficiently healed so the mammogram isn't overly painful. the guideline i've mentioned here may not align with your surgeon's preferences which is why you should speak to him or her. also my comments only pertain to uncomplicated breast reduction cases. if you have developed a lump or other lesion that requires investigation with a mammogram then you should not necessarily delay the imaging test just because you recently had a breast reduction procedure. you should instead discuss the situation with your doctor and move forward with the recommended testing. wishing you well!"
i am not a doctor just an informed medical consumer. i would have someone take you to the emergency room. your symptoms are suspcious of bleeding in the digestive tract perhaps significant since you are lightheaded. if you are reluctant to do that at least call your doctor. if he's not available i strongly suggest having someone take you to the emergency room.
need to know whether the blood was blackish or bright red. a lot depends on this. oesophageal varieces ( dilation of veins) can rupture causing the oral bleed. maintain proper hemoglobin levels. detailed endoscopy should be done to find out the root cause of bleed.
no it does not. tetanus shots only protect against one thing. tetanus. although not specifically approved for cold sores anti-herpetic drugs used for genital herpes and other herpetic infections (like shingles and chicken pox) may help. these would include medications like acylovir famvir etc. you would need to address this with your medical provider.
strep is really uncommon/rare in people who have had their tonsils removed but it is certainly not impossible especially if this person has a confirmed strep test or culture.
this nausea occurs before chemotherapy treatment. people who have received chemotherapy in the past may experience nausea and vomiting before their treatment begins because they expect these symptoms to occur.
"no i wouldn't recommend wet wipes or anything like that for treating pinkeye. conjunctivitis is also called ""pinkeye"" and refers to inflammation (redness and swelling) of the membranes that surround the eye. usually conjunctivitis makes the white part of the eye look bloodshot and the lower lid may appear swollen. you may experience burning itching and drainage from the eye too. if you think you or your child might have pinkeye you should see a health care provider as soon as possible. there are different types of conjunctivitis some that do well with treatment. also conjunctivitis is highly contagious so you or your child should not go to school or work until the cause has been determined. be sure to wash your hands often and thoroughly if you have pinkeye. baby wipes antibacterial wipes and wet wipes should never be used around the eye. to get rid of the ""gunk"" (drainage) that often goes along with pinkeye use a wash cloth or paper towel soaked with lukewarm water and gently clean the outer eye area. cool compresses may help with the burning and itching. symptoms of pinkeye usually go away within a week. if you still have symptoms after a week it's time for a trip back to the doctor. hope this helps! sorry you're feeling miserable."
hi it could be due to your round ligaments in that area stretching to accomodate baby's growth. it's painful but normal. but you could go get checked out just in case its something else. good luck
based on a set of criteria a  level between .  and . % is prediabetes. this means that there is an increased risk for developing diabetes. essentially prediabetes describes a group of people with blood sugar levels between normal and the level used to diagnose someone with overt diabetes. it's important to discuss this with your health care provider since this category carries an increased risk of both diabetes and heart disease. most people in this category are overweight and have developed resistance to the actions of insulin. to help reduce your risk of developing overt diabetes and to reduce your risk of heart disease requires simple actions: routine exercise and weight management through reduce calories and nutritional knowledge. muscles are the primary site of action for insulin so get moving find an activity you enjoy and commit to a change in your priorities and lifestyle. these actions help utilize sugars burn fat and improve insulin's function. all of which reduce your risks of both diseases.

the risk of developing colon cancer is  times higher for patients with inflammatory bowel disease than it is for the general population. the association with colon cancer is more clearly established in ulcerative colitis than in crohn's disease. an increased risk most likely also exists however for patients with crohn's disease that affects the colon. in ulcerative colitis the risk of acquiring colon cancer increases according to how much of the colon is involved and the duration of colitis. thus after about eight to  years of ulcerative colitis especially if the entire colon is involved the risk of developing colon cancer substantially increases. other risk factors for colon cancer in ibd patients include a liver disease called primary sclerosing cholangitis a family history of colon cancer and a history of liver transplantation. additional possible risk factors include the use of concurrent immunosuppressive medications and a deficiency of the vitamin folic acid.
many people are not aware that the law now prevents insurers from denying anyone coverage regardless of the condition of their health which it does. even among people who do know about this provision many have a hard time believing it's true. i've talked to people with cancer for example who simply don't believe they will be guaranteed coverage if they don't get insurance through their job.
you were exposed to chlamydia from one of your sexual partners but it would not be possible to know who or when you were exposed. yes chlamydia can go unnoticed especially in women for a long time. not all sexual partners are % honest about their fidelity in a relationship. as you know using a condom would have prevented exposure. make sure that both of you are treated and test negative again. since you do not know for sure that your current partner exposed you it would be best to not have unprotected sex.
adult brain tumors are diseases in which cancer (malignant) cells begin to grow in the tissues of the brain. the brain controls memory and learning senses (hearing sight smell taste and touch) and emotion. it also controls other parts of the body including muscles organs and blood vessels. tumors that start in the brain are called primary brain tumors.
yes that is safe.
this type of steroid should not be used on the face for a prolonged period of time and it can cause a steroid discoloration. you will need to show this skin change to a good dermatologist to ask those very specific questions about recovery. it would not be possible to blindly guess over the internet. a hands-on examination is required. in the meantime stop the triamcinolone.
in my opinion you would be having anaemia and dehydration as a common post delivery complication drink plenty of fluids and get a cbc done do u have fever?
this is quite a common occurrence and is caused mainly due to the hormonal changes that come about during pregnancy and after delivery however if she has general joint pains not specific to one joint it could be nutritional deficiency so i recommend healthy diet rich with fibers fruits vegetables milk and eggs to compensate for those deficiencies. feel better soon

since influenza (assuming this is what he had) only lasts about a week with the worst symptoms the first few days she has exceeded this time. she should be examined for a secondary infection at this point. hi that's how we all get after flu just treat her cough with a cough medicine which should sort out her throat as well and slowly her appetite will come back when that happens her strength will come back as well and she will feel a better so cant see why you need a doctor? good luck
the key to enjoying cookouts is to know what foods agree with you. if grease bothers you stick with grilled foods or vegetables. instead of tomatoes load up your salads with carrots beans jicama or other milder veggies. burgers are ok but get the leanest cuts and dress them with guacamole or something else less acidic than catsup. if carbonated drinks lead to late-night torture stick with iced tea. if margaritas and you don't get along drink less or switch to a virgin strawberry type. watermelon can be acid-producing. consign it to a mixed-fruit salad only. eat smaller portions. your stomach detects large amounts and pumps out more acid.
generally shingles heals well and problems are few. however on occasion the blisters can become infected with bacteria causing cellulitis a bacterial infection of the skin. if this occurs the area will become reddened warm firm and tender. you might notice red streaks forming around the wound. if you notice any of these symptoms contact your health-care professional. antibiotics can be used to treat these complications. a more worrisome complication occurs when shingles affects the face specifically the forehead and nose. in this situation it is possible although not likely that shingles can affect the eye (known as herpes zoster ophthalmicus) leading to loss of vision. if you have shingles on your forehead or nose your eyes should be evaluated by a health-care professional. a rare complication of shingles is known as ramsay hunt syndrome. in this case the cranial nerves (cranial nerves v ix and x) are involved. symptoms may include peripheral facial nerve weakness and deafness. the typical rash is often observed around the ear and ear canal.

most helpful answer there is no correlation between milk intake and the formation of scoliosis in adolescence. the nutrients in milk (calcium. phosphorus etc. ) are very important for bone health but not drinking milk would not cause scoliosis. many people are lacose-intolerant and do not ever drink milk and there rates of scoliosis are no higher. scoliosis can just happen. as a young woman she needs calcium for instance but there are other sources of this essential element in vegetables. of course she may not eat those either. give her that one-a-day vitamin but she may need an addional mineral supplement as well.
you can be irregular

in the united states approximately   people contract hbv  each year. however only   to   of these people develop a chronic hepatitis b infection. why do some people clear the virus from their bodies while others progress to chronic disease? it appears that the immune system is the most important factor in determining whether a person can rid herself of this virus rather than develop a persistent infection. the immune system is relatively immature early in life. therefore the younger a person is when hbv is contracted the greater the likelihood that the infected person will become a chronic carrier of the disease. if an adult is infected her probability of developing chronic disease is very low—approximately  to  percent. if a person contracts the infection in infancy there is as much as a - to -percent chance that her immune system will be unable to eliminate this virus from her body. children fall somewhere in between having approximately a  to  percent chance of going on to chronic disease. men are six times more likely than women to become chronic carriers of hbv. the reason for this has not been determined. also people with poor immune systems—such as those infected with hiv organ recipients and those undergoing chemotherapy—have a much lower success rate of eliminating the virus from their bodies. patients who are the sickest during their acute illness especially those who develop jaundice or who survive fulminant hepatitis have the highest likelihood of totally recovering and thus not progressing to a chronic disease.

you may be. eligibility for medicaid is based on your income and whether or not you live in one of the states expanding its coverage. if you earn less than roughly $  per year you would qualify for medicaid but again your state must be expanding its program. you can learn about what's happening in your state by checking webmd's state pages map: <link>. if your state isn't expanding you may still qualify for tax subsidies that can lower both how much you pay for an insurance plan and for your medical care. once you find your state page by clicking on the link provided above you'll be able to find another link to your state's marketplace. there you'll be able to learn what coverage and/or financial help you're eligible for.

the complex process of digestion affects the timing location and particular symptoms of an allergic reaction to food. all of the symptoms of food allergy occur within a few minutes to an hour of eating. a food allergy can initially be experienced as an itching in the mouth and difficulty swallowing and breathing. then during digestion of the food in the stomach and intestines symptoms such as nausea vomiting diarrhea and abdominal pain can start. incidentally the gastrointestinal symptoms of food allergy are those that are most often confused with the symptoms of different types of food intolerance. as mentioned previously the allergens are absorbed and enter the bloodstream. when they reach the skin allergens can induce hives or eczema and when they reach the airways they can cause asthma. as the allergens travel through the blood vessels they can cause lightheadedness weakness and anaphylaxis which is a sudden drop in blood pressure. anaphylactic reactions are severe even when they start off with mild symptoms such as a tingling in the mouth and throat or discomfort in the abdomen. they can be fatal if not treated quickly.
the drug itself is not a contraindication to sexual activity so if you feel like having sex then have sex.
"sorry to hear this. it doesn't sound very pleasant! your best bet is to call your health care provider's office and let him or her know what's going on. your symptoms may be normal. or it may not. everyone heals at a different rate so what's normal for one person may not be normal for another. since your health care provider knows your personal history s/he can tell you what to do about your discharge. on a related note i always tell people the one thing they must keep in their medicine cabinet at home is a thermometer. you should always be able to tell your doctor if you're running a fever or not because it's a key symptom of infection. ""feeling warm"" and other nonsensical tests are no substitute for numbers on a thermometer. you can help your doctor a lot by investing a couple of bucks in a digital thermometer and telling him/her if you're running a fever in conjunction with your other symptoms. wishing you well!"
it may be very hard to take that first step to help yourself. it may take time but you can get better with treatment. to help yourself: talk to your doctor about treatment options and progress. keep a regular routine such as eating meals at the same time every day and going to sleep at the same time every night. try to get enough sleep. stay on your medication. learn about warning signs signaling a shift into depression or mania. expect your symptoms to improve gradually not immediately.
some medications like proton pump inhibitors can cause an increased heart rate though.

baby : your baby measures about .  inches from crown to rump and weighs a little more than  pounds. hands are active and muscle coordination is such that he can get his thumb into his mouth. thumb-sucking calms the baby and strengthens his cheek and jaw muscles. your baby can cry now. mom-to-be : you may see stretch marks as your uterus continues to expand. most women have gained about  to  pounds by now. balance and mobility also may be changing as you grow larger. tip of the week : during your last trimester you should talk to your doctor or midwife about the delivery. you'll learn such things as signs to predict labor and how far apart the contractions should be before going to the hospital or birth center. it's also the time to begin interviewing pediatricians and to take care of other logistics like pre-registration and a birthing plan (what you envision your labor and delivery will be like). this plan should be written in your patient record or attached to it in the form of a birth plan.
fava beans grow in a large pod that needs to be peeled in order to find the beans that lie within. if you have small children this is an excellent task for them. once you get all the beans out of their pods there are a few more simple steps. the outer shell of the bean is kind of chalky and not good eating. you need to blanch the pods (put them quickly into boiling water then plunge them into ice water). from there you can pop them out of their shells and enjoy them with a bit of extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkle of salt and pepper and a shave of parmesan cheese. you can use them to top a piece of your favorite fish or a piece of grilled chicken. when fava beans are young you can actually eat the outside as well as the inside. for those heat up a cast iron skillet and add a bit of olive oil. when its almost smoking throw the fava beans in whole add a bit of lemon juice chili flakes and salt and pepper and in about - minutes they are ready to eat. if you can find fava beans at your local farmers market or grocery store give them a try!

the most common side effect with taking too much pepto-bismol is the temporary and harmless black darkening of the tongue and stools. this can subside and is caused by a reaction to sulfa in the mouth. however there are more serious side effects with toxic levels of pepto-bismol such as severe allergic reactions (rash hive itching difficulty breathing tightness in chest swelling of the mouth face lips or tongue) fever hearing loss nausea ringing in the ears severe constipation and vomiting. if any of these symptoms do occur stop taking the medication and consult your health care professional.
the answer is: it depends. you need to discuss this with your gynecologist. many factors affect whether or not a tubal ligation reversal may be successful. some of these factors are: your age your general health status the type of tubal ligation procedure you had whether or not you previously had a successful pregnancy whether or not you have had any other gynecological surgeries such as for endometriosis or fibroid tumors these are not the only considerations. obviously if you're past the age of menopause reversing your tubal ligation will not enable you to get pregnant because you're no longer producing eggs. because it's been so long since you had your tubes tied the records about the type of procedure performed may no longer be available. however if the doctor who performed the procedure is still practicing you might consult him or her to discover if the records are available. taking this information to your current gynecologist will be helpful in determining if tubal ligation reversal might be successful for you. wishing you all the best!
about % of people have no symptoms when they first acquire hepatitis c infection. the remaining % may complain of fatigue loss of appetite muscle aches or fever. yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice) is rare at this early stage of infection. over time the liver in people with chronic infection may begin to experience the effects of the persistent inflammation caused by the immune reaction to the virus. blood tests may show elevated levels of liver enzymes a sign of liver damage which is often the first suggestion that the infection may be present. patients may become easily fatigued or complain of nonspecific symptoms. as cirrhosis develops symptoms increase and may include : weakness. loss of appetite. weight loss. breast enlargement in men. a rash on the palms. difficulty with the clotting of blood. spider-like blood vessels on the skin. in patients with advanced cirrhosis the liver begins to fail. this is a life-threatening problem. confusion and even coma (encephalopathy) may result from the inability of the liver to process certain toxic substances. increased pressure in the blood vessels of the liver (portal hypertension) may cause fluid to build up in the abdominal cavity (ascites) and result in engorged veins in the swallowing tube (esophageal varices) that tear easily and can bleed suddenly and massively. portal hypertension also can cause kidney failure or an enlarged spleen resulting in a decrease of blood cells and the development of anemia increased risk of infection and bleeding. in advanced cirrhosis liver failure causes decreased production of clotting factors. patients with advanced cirrhosis often develop jaundice because the damaged liver is unable to eliminate a yellow compound called bilirubin that is formed from the hemoglobin of old red blood cells.

just give it a rest my friend. it is not likely that you cause testicular damage from overly-masturbating but you can cause enough trauma to have discomfort. if your symptoms persist you will need to see your medical provider but i suspect a few days of rest and recuperation will give our over-worked boys time to completely recover.
"not all people are ""sexperts"" so i consider all questions to be valid. there are no dumb questions. just unanswered questions and if you can't ask your most basic or intimate questions to a medical provider for a straight and serious answer who can you ask? if you thing on-line questions about sex are amusing you should spend a day with me in an adolescent health clinic. feel free to answer some of the basic sex questions if you know the answer but be nice. you were young and uninformed at some point in your life as well."
i would suggest you speak with your physician to discuss alternative clinical options.
before sexual activity begins the woman inserts the condom into her vagina so that the closed end of the tube covers the cervix and the other end slightly covers the labia (lips on the outside of the vagina). the condom blocks sperm from entering the womb. female condoms should be discarded after one use.

chlamydia is caused by the bacterium chlamydia trachomatis. the disease is spread by oral vaginal or anal sex and if you touch your eyes with a contaminated hand you may also develop conjunctivitis. chlamydia can be passed during vaginal birth to the infant. there is some evidence to support that untreated chlamydial infections in pregnancy can lead to premature delivery.

most minor cases of pectus excavatum do not need surgery and that may include you. the fact that your team-mates outrun you may have little to do with the pectus. if you do have surgery there are several different procedures and the recovery time will vary. you can't have surgery just because you want it. it would only be done if the surgeon determines you need it.

"there are two issues here. let's start with the brushing first. i love the fact that you want to brush after every meal. this is the best way to keep excellent oral hygiene. however if you cannot brush after every meal brushing morning and night is quite sufficient. the best thing is to ask your dentist/hygienist to evaluate your home care and let him/her give you the proper feedback if you are doing it right. the gum issue is different: gum chewing (on the contrary to the trident commercial) is not totally good for you. the good thing is that it stimulates salivation making your mouth ready for food consumption (is that what your really want when you are on a diet? ). the bad thing about gum chewing is that it over-exercises your muscles of mastication. we are not supposed to chew ""non-stop"" throughout the day. when you do that you are putting undue stress on your teeth and muscles and cause premature wear and tear. your teeth should only come into contact when you swallow and if they do otherwise you will experience premature wear of your dentition. keep brushing and flossing regularly and easy on the gum chewing."

you can ask your doc about this. tell him you need a prn (as needed) short-acting med just for specific trips and only to be used sparingly. i would also recommend that you learn relaxation techniques and use them prior to any car trips and use them on a regular basis.
smokers can be charged more for their coverage under the law than non-smokers by as much as %. the law defines a tobacco user as someone who uses any tobacco product including cigarettes cigars chewing tobacco snuff and pipe tobacco four or more times a week within the past  months. under small employer health plans you can't be charged the surcharge if you join a smoking cessation program but that's not available to people buying coverage on their own. some states have decided that insurers cannot charge smokers more for coverage so see what's available in your state.

thank you – i know some of the more serious pathologies are very rare in younger people but are there any issues that i should be especially concerned about?
osteoarthritis (ah-stee-oh-ar-threye-tis) is the most common type of arthritis and is seen especially among older people. sometimes it is called degenerative joint disease or osteoarthrosis. osteoarthritis mostly affects cartilage (kar-til-uj) the hard but slippery tissue that covers the ends of bones where they meet to form a joint. healthy cartilage allows bones to glide over one another. it also absorbs energy from the shock of physical movement. in osteoarthritis the surface layer of cartilage breaks down and wears away. this allows bones under the cartilage to rub together causing pain swelling and loss of motion of the joint. over time the joint may lose its normal shape. also small deposits of bone – called osteophytes or bone spurs – may grow on the edges of the joint. bits of bone or cartilage can break off and float inside the joint space. this causes more pain and damage. people with osteoarthritis usually have joint pain and some movement limitations. unlike some other forms of arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis affects only joint function and does not affect skin tissue the lungs the eyes or the blood vessels. in rheumatoid arthritis the second most common form of arthritis the immune system attacks the tissues of the joints leading to pain inflammation and eventually joint damage and malformation. it typically begins at a younger age than osteoarthritis causes swelling and redness in joints and may make people feel sick tired and uncommonly feverish.
corns don't occur under nails but warts do. this is not something that you can treat at home so see a dermatologist.
you ask a good question. many people have concerns about going under general anesthesia even when they're in good health. certainly a generally healthy -year old man would not be at much higher risk of complications from general anesthesia than anyone else. however that doesn't matter because the individual has stated he doesn't want to go under general anesthesia. and you know what? that might be ok. depending on how bad the umbilical hernia is he might be able to have the procedure done under sedation -- much like what you get when you have a colonoscopy. it's enough iv medication to keep you comfortably drowsy but no breathing tube is involved and waking up generally is quick. the patient might also be able to have the umbilical hernia repaired under just local anesthesia (numbing injections to the area) if the hernia isn't too severe. i suggest the gentleman discuss his concerns with a surgeon. if one surgeon won't consider doing the repair under sedation or local anesthesia feel free to consult others. it may not sound logical but you might consider consulting a plastic and reconstructive surgeon because they have other tissue-numbing methods at their disposal that might work well for someone who's reluctant to undergo general anesthesia. i hope the gentleman gets his umbilical hernia repaired because it's usually a pretty straightforward procedure and his quality of life likely will be greatly improved afterwards. wishing you well!
i'm sorry our little one is going through this. the american academy of pediatrics recommends keeping children off solid food for the first  hours after vomiting. to ensure enough fluids have her sip water drink electrolyte replacement drinks like pedialyte sip on broth and suck on popsicles. you want to slowly work back to her regular diet. if things don't improve call her pediatrician.
i think probiotics are fine and not harmful over the long term. as you know they contain friendly yeast and bacteria that are normally found in the body's intestines; called normal flora. they do not contain harmful or potentially dangerous mixtures of organisms. if there is an imbalance in our normal flora probiotics can help correct the problem especially with candida overgrowth. the body will basically incorporate whatever it needs from the probiotic pills to rebalance the flora. if we have chronic problems then regular probiotics may be needed and helpful. if we are balanced and still take probiotics that may not be needed at that time the body should simply pass it through with no harm done. if my patients feel they help i have no problem if they continue taking probiotics.
hi well at  your still at that age for your periods to do this stop and start it does happen and for gaining weight and on top of that getting acne. try seeing your doctor for a blood test for your hormones they could be out of whack and a blood test tells all. do hope this helps you. good luck

hi if these are the symptoms then definitely he needs a medical consultation. see a neurologist get a ct and mri done. thanks
so sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds miserable! if you had been taking hormone replacement therapy but went off it some time ago it doesn't seem likely your symptoms are related to lack of estrogen. if on the other hand you stopped hrt relatively recently then your symptoms could indeed be related to a reduction in your female hormone levels. because other health issues can cause the symptoms you describe i'd suggest you visit your primary care provider for an evaluation. he or she may have you get some blood work done to try to determine the cause of your symptoms. i wish you all the best!
it is very difficult to reach a definitive diagnosis with the information that you have given about your  year old nephew but i will still hint at the possibilities. the first possibility to consider is that of disruptive behavioral disorder characterised by destructive and disobedient behaviors as in your nephew like hitting others yelling calling others stupid and missing school  out of  days. as children age oppositional and defiant behavior may continue and result in children having persisting conflicts with adults and peers at home and at school. the other likely possibility though is that of autism as indicated by stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms of opening and closing of hands plus the speech problems like inability to sustain a conversation delay in development of spoken language(as you said that his speech is hard to understand) preoccupation with stereotyped interest(as in going to bathroom on the porch). the other likely possibility is that of premorbid stage of childhood schizophrenia in the form of disorganized speech(before he can finish one talk he stops and talks about something different and completely unrelated) aggressive behaviour disruptive behaviour alternating moods inappropriate to environment school problems etc. the only thing missing is the presence of delusions and hallucinations which usually do not develop before mid adolescence. so it is difficult to commit schizophrenia but still suggestive of premorbid stage suggesting the likelihood of developing into full fledged schizophrenia in adolescent years of life. all above are the likely possibilities only as it is not possible to reach definitive diagnosis without detailed interview of child and parents and observation of the child in person. you must consult your pediatrician for the same as early intervention is always helpful in treating the psychopathology. hope this helps. take care.
masturbation is a choice. it is definitely not necessary. eating is necessary. drinking is necessary. paying taxes is necessary. masturbation is optional. masturbation is not a necessity and if a person does not want to engage in the practice there is no reason that he should; however if he opts not to masturbate and it is not due to reasons such as religious beliefs being too busy enjoys exerting willpower etc. he may want to consider consulting with a doctor in case he has a low libido and might want to take steps to address that issue. on a separate note all men should keep an eye on their penis health; using a top notch penis health cream (health professionals recommend  man oil) can help. a good bet is a cream that includes l-arginine which can help with penis blood flow issues. hi o the joys of a j arthur one of the wrist spank the monkey bash the bishop yes these all mean to masturbate with the pleasure of ones own penis. its something we don't did to do but if your feeling horny and your wife g/f are not around then being men we just did it don't put it off don't try and hold back from it its not dirty and don't be ashamed but it will make you fell relaxed. its something you can do in the shower the bath in the car(but not why your driving or why taken a walk in the country. as men do we need it your read at some point that some men can go through there whole life and say never done that! but doing it is good for our prostate keeps our system ticking over till we do need it so yes in one way we do need to masturbate why our body's need it so for that just once or twice a week will not hurt you. but don't forget don't use a tight grip it needs to be feather light just like the feel of the vagina and use some oil just baby oil will do or some olive oil if your in the kitchen shower gel when in the shower gives that extra clean same in the bath or just a bar of soap it all helps. do hope this helps. good luck

"this is kind of a ""loaded"" question. it is like saying can chiropractic care stop the sun from setting or prevent rain. osteoporosis is a bone disease with a decrease in bone density associated with aging (sun setting) or prolonged use of certain medications. scoliosis is either caused by structural abnormality of a vertebrae or idiopathic (unknown). on the flip side of that chiropractic care can certainly help relieve symptoms associated with scoliosis and in some case help manage the process. as children grow the scoliosis curvature needs to be monitored as well as any symptoms they are having. in an ideal world md's and dc's- pt's would work together to manage this process. if you want to live in an ideal world find ""specialists"" who are open minded and educated about not only what they can do but what others can do to help you as well. in the long run you are the one that has to live with whatever condition you have and no one else's ideology should be more important than that."

medical researchers aren't sure exactly how stress increases the risk of heart disease. stress itself might be a risk factor or it could be that high levels of stress make other risk factors (such as high cholesterol or high blood pressure) worse. for example if you are under stress your blood pressure goes up you may overeat you may exercise less and you may be more likely to smoke. if stress itself is a risk factor for heart disease it could be because chronic stress exposes your body to unhealthy persistently elevated levels of stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol. studies also link stress to changes in the way blood clots which increases the risk of heart attack.

infection usually is spread by fecal-oral contamination although occasionally the virus is spread by droplets expelled by infected individuals. items like utensils diaper-changing tables and toys that come in contact with body fluids that contain the virus may also transmit them to other individuals. although people of any age can get infected the majority of patients identified with coxsackie infection are children. pregnant women can pass coxsackie virus to their newborns which may cause serious problems for the newborn so pregnant women need to notify their obstetrician if they exhibit symptoms of the infection especially if they are near their delivery date. risk factors for coxsackie virus infection include physical contact with any patient with individuals with hfmd symptoms. infectious virus can be found in feces saliva fluid in blisters and nasal secretions. even patients who have recovered and have no symptoms may still shed infectious virus for weeks.

"doctors and dietitians encourage patients to keep a food-and-symptoms diary for several weeks. ""by keeping track of what you eat and how you feel afterward you can identify specific foods that exacerbate your symptoms "" says dietitian tracie dalessandro rd author of what to eat with ibd. a dietitian may also want to review your diary to make sure that you're eating a well-balanced diet that includes all the nutrition you need. many experts recommend keeping a diary for at least three weeks. keep in mind that your goal should be to eat as wide a variety of foods as you can to assure well-balanced nutrition.

"most people who eliminate up sugar have a hard time the first week or so and then feel better after that. the problem is that eventually most everyone who gives up sugar will eat it again -- and that is when the problems start. a better strategy might be to cut back on sugar -- and try to find more wholesome forms of sweet foods. instead of fighting against your sweet tooth which may cause the eventual ""over-consumption "" honor sweet cravings by finding more wholesome options. you can try a few squares of dark chocolate (be mindful and savor it) or bit of honey in your oatmeal that is topped with fruit and nuts. the result will be a diet that is much lower in sugar but higher in satisfaction. for more tips on dealing with sugar cravings see this webmd article. good luck with your health journey!"
if the redness and itchiness is in the same spot as where you applied the patch this is a common side effect of patches applied to the skin. it is important when you use a patch to rotate the sites of application each day and to try and avoid using the same spot for at least  days. this can help curb the local reaction caused by the patch. if it happens every day wherever you apply the patch you could be allergic to one of the ingredients in the patch. you can ask your pharmacist to suggest a different patch or a different method to help you quit smoking if you are allergic to the patch you are using.
many people dont realize that winter itch is a form of eczema one that tends to run in families. if your parents have it chances are that you and your children will develop it too. even babies can suffer from winter itch. even if you are genetically prone to eczema you can still take steps to protect your skin which may prevent eczema or at least ensure only a mild case. first of all moisturize your skin. this is the crucial step because you want to keep the skin barrier intact. even if it has turned warm again outside now is the time to start using the most effective moisturizers you can find. drugstores sell inexpensive yet highly effective petrolatum-based ointments and creams that are heavy enough to protect the skin. it is a very good idea to use these or a moisturizing lotion right after your bath or shower when the skin is still damp. oils work well too. for daytime wear when you may want to use something a little lighter and less greasy look for creams and lotions that contain hyaluronic acid shea butter avocado oil or glycerin. dimethicone a silicone-based ingredient works for many but not for those whose skin is prone to acne since it can increase breakouts. hands contain comparatively few oil glands and tend to dry and crack easily. the use of those alcohol-based sanitizers doesnt help either. not only do they dry skin more than good old soap and water theyarent as effective at killing viruses and bacteria. actually you dont even have to use soap which is undeniably drying to wash your hands. products marketed as gentle cleansers for sensitive skins work beautifully; carry a small bottle in your bag and use it instead of those scented soaps in public restrooms. in fact stay away from scented soaps period since they tend to irritate the skin. as for deodorant soaps they are absolutely terrible for anybody prone to winter itch – ditch them immediately! take shorter showers and baths and try to use a moisturizing body wash or a super-fatted soap. ifyour skin is very sensitive you can use the same gentle facial cleanser i recommend for hands.
i'm sorry to hear about your fall. that's certainly never pleasant! it's impossible to tell what's going on without performing a physical examination but i'm going to take a stab at this. i'm thinking you may have irritated or injured the patellar tendon where it attaches to the tibial tuberosity. let me explain that in laymen's terms. the patella of course is the kneecap. it is attached to the lower leg by a tendon. if you bend your knee and feel the very top of your shin bone you'll notice a bony bump. this is the tibial tuberosity (the 'tibia' being the medical term for your shin bone). the patellar ligament attaches to the tibial tuberosity. if you fell onto that area of your knee you very likely may have injured the tendon. the bad news is this can take a long (long) time to heal. tendons have poor blood circulation which means the tissue doesn't get as much oxygen as say muscle tissue does. and since oxygen is crucial to tissue repair it takes tendons and ligaments much longer to heal than other body tissues. on the plus side it probably will heal eventually. assuming you did in fact injure the patellar tendon your best course of action is to avoid doing anything else to irritate it. that means no kneeling no activities that cause lots of bending (such as playing soccer) and things like that. rest will help your leg heal. if you're not allergic to them anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen can help the pain. if the pain persists you can always get re-checked to see if this is indeed a soft tissue injury. wishing you well!

i am unfamiliar with iss-t-ibose. ribose is an organic compound found within our bodies and the foods we eat. it is a simple sugar or monosaccharide. d-ribose is often marketed as a supplement for bodybuilders. many products contain d-ribose promoting weight loss appetite suppression increased energy and mental health support. although there are claims being made for its weight loss properties there have been no solid statistics to support these claims. many of the products containing this ingredient are expensive and hard to find. it is also not fda approved so caution is advised with this product. if a product is difficult to find and stores do not keep it in stock that is a sign that it isnt all that safe or effective.
we all have a genetic blueprint to how our big or small are body is supposed to be. when we eat healthy eat mindfully (meaning we don't eat past fullness often) and are active weight tends to take care of itself. if you are healthy (good blood pressure cholesterol etc. ) and not overweight there is no reason to get to an ideal weight. if you need to starve to get there then that tells me that is not the right weight for you. we are not all meant to be small and there is nothing magical about the ideal weight numbers. so my advice is that you focus on your healthy lifestyle and accepting your body as it is. you could focus more on different exercises and ways to increase fitness such as feeling stronger but i see no reason why you need to lose weight. i know our society says otherwise but spending all that energy on a weight that seems right for you may not be the best use of your time. best of health to you! i am not a fitness expert although i work for them but i wanted to offer an answer from my own personal experience. i had this same question not to long ago. i exercise - times a week eat healthy have  kids and  dogs who i run after or with all day long! but i was stuck at my target weight. i'm ' i wanted to be . made it down to  from almost  about  months ago. my trainer also a good friend of mine said i needed to stop looking at the scale and focus on what was most important. being healthy and enjoying life. just as the last expert answer states. everyone is different. i stopped looking at the scale and put my efforts into enjoying the activities i love best and eating healthy but not limiting myself from foods i love or starving myself. i also change up my exercise routine regularly. i started doing hiit (you can google it) high intensity training classes. wow definitely felt the difference. about a week ago i went to my annual physical and weighed in for the  time in months. i was . i must be doing something right but what's different now is my outlook on my body and lifestyle. weight is just a number what's important to me is how i feel and having the energy to keep up with my very active family. it sounds like you are on the right path to a healthy fit life style. i wish you all the best and don't sweat the small stuff. enjoy life and save the sweat for the gym! <positive_smiley> -angel

"yes. just stop eating. weight loss occurs when your body takes in less than it needs. how fast you lose that - pounds depends on many factors including how much you weigh right now. a pound of fat is   calories so if you ate  less calories a day than you need to maintain your ideal weight (about  calories per pound of ideal weight) you will lose about two pounds a week.  pounds a month. in about  weeks you can safely reach your goal. you can lose it faster or slower but when you exercise you can ""reshape"" and look like you lost more."

adults do have better immune systems and exposure to any infectious disease does not automatic imply that you or a sibling contact will get it. but you may. there are just too many variables to be able to predict if someone will also become ill. your twin six-month olds are more vulnerable of course since they are at the end of their maternal immunity stage. only time will tell. for all of you.
i would highly recommend heading to the er and having it checked out. sometimes it could be an episode of severe heartburn or it could be something else -- especially since you have pains in your chest.
yes. television stimulates brain areas that interfere with sleep; it also suppresses the release of melatonin a natural hormone important in day-night cycling. children and teens especially tend to use even-more stimulating gadgets near bedtime. video games include rapid graphic images. computers cell phones and ipads support thousands of interactive applications that connect kids socially without any particular off time.  children with cell- or web-connected devices in their bedrooms get not only the sleep-depriving effect of bright screens at bedtime but may also continue to play games and communicate with friends well after what parents might have thought was lights out.  there are significant social health and educational consequences facing kids who arent getting their needed - hours of sleep every night. underslept children do poorer in school often exhibiting add-like behavior. they have more trouble getting along with friends and family and are more likely to struggle with obesity and depression. many teens who feel sleepy consume huge servings of coffee to stay awake which can further disrupt their normal sleep rhythm and leave them even more sleep-deprived.

inguinal hernias typically flatten or disappear when they are pushed gently back into place or when you lie down. over time hernias tend to increase in size as the abdominal muscle wall becomes weaker and more tissue bulges through. if you can't push your hernia back into your belly it is incarcerated. a hernia gets incarcerated when tissue moves into the sac of the hernia and fills it up. this is not necessarily an emergency. but if a loop of the intestine is trapped very tightly in the hernia the blood supply to that part of the intestine can be cut off ( strangulated ) causing tissue to die. in a man if tissue is trapped the testicle and its blood vessels can also be damaged. a strangulated hernia is a medical emergency that requires immediate surgery. in adults a hernia that can be pushed back into the abdomen can be surgically repaired at a convenient time. this is because incarceration is rare in adults. a hernia that cannot be pushed back can be repaired when surgery is convenient unless you have increased pain redness of the overlying skin fever nausea and vomiting or abdominal bloating. if any of these symptoms occur the hernia may need to be fixed sooner. inguinal hernias can come back after surgical repair. but in women it is rare for inguinal hernias to recur. fertility is usually not affected by an inguinal hernia or hernia surgery. but in males there is a chance that surgery or an incarcerated hernia can cause injury to the vas deferens the tube that carries sperm from the testicles to the urethra. it is not yet known how often or to what degree this affects a man's ability to father a child. in rare cases surgery or an incarcerated hernia may injure the blood vessels that supply one or both testicles with blood which may cause the affected testicle to shrink. hernias in children infants or children with an inguinal hernia need to have surgery as soon as possible because of the increased risk that a part of the intestine will become trapped and blood supply will be cut off leading to tissue death. incarceration when intestinal or abdominal tissue fills up the sac of a hernia occurs in about  or  out of  infants younger than  months who have hernias. most incarcerated hernias occur before the infant is  year old.  female infants face a higher risk of incarceration. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

in females vaginal yeast infections can cause burning itching and sometimes a whitish chunky discharge. yeast is normally found in the vagina in very small amounts. a yeast infection happens when this yeast begins to grow out of control. things that can cause this to happen include: • antibiotics • hormones • pregnancy • diabetes • weakened immune system but there are other things that can also cause white discharge from the vagina. you should make an appointment with your doctor or your gynecologist to see what is causing your symptoms.

i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds miserable and worrisome. i want to emphasize your need to stay hydrated even if drinking water gives you nausea. maybe try drinking water at different temperatures to see if one is more palatable than another. or see if there's a vitamin water flavored water or type of sports drink you can tolerate. despite the fact you've been tested for celiac and other conditions in the past my advice to you is to keep pursuing a cause for your symptoms. some conditions take a long time to be diagnosed such as gastroparesis. sometimes tests need to be repeated periodically and the results compared in order to reach a diagnosis. it's ok to be very pro-active with your health care providers in pushing for additional testing or repeated tests (depending on how much time has elapsed) in order to get a diagnosis. i'd suggest keeping copies of all your lab results and imaging films. usually these can be provided to you on cds for easy storage. you'll want to keep these for new doctors you may consult and for comparison of test results over time. i wish i had some magic suggestion to offer you in terms of a diagnosis but that's not the case. like i said hang in there and don't give up just because you've had a few tests done. keep going back to your provider(s) to let them know you still have symptoms. i wish you all the best!
hi if you picked it up then you can pass it on i don't think the incubation period counts but what does count is that you have it. good luck
most helpful answer oh ouch! sorry to hear you went through this. the sacrifices we make to look good right? ! it sounds to me from your description like the wound healing process is proceeding along a normal course. that brownish/yellowish goop you see likely is caused by an excessive number of protein cells. the body tends to overcompensate a little when trying to heal a wound like this. unless you spike a fever (over ) and start feeling nauseated or something you're probably good to go. i'm sure your doctor gave you wound care instructions. you don't need to scrub that goo off but you can cleanse the wound with cool soapy water and pat dry. the silver sulfadiazine was a great choice for this type of burn. that stuff is nearly miraculous in my opinion. a thin layer is all you need. eventually this will wound scab over. it sounds like you might have a scar from this burn. if that concerns you feel free to consult your physician again after it's healed for some options about how to minimize the scar. all the best to you!
"hyperthyroidism is suggested by several signs and symptoms; however patients with mild disease usually experience no symptoms. in patients older than  years the typical signs and symptoms also may be absent. in general the symptoms become more obvious as the degree of hyperthyroidism increases. the symptoms usually are related to an increase in the metabolic rate of the body. common symptoms include: excessive sweating. heat intolerance. increased bowel movements. tremor (usually fine shaking). nervousness; agitation. rapid heart rate. weight loss. fatigue. decreased concentration. irregular and scant menstrual flow. in older patients irregular heart rhythms and heart failure can occur. in its most severe form untreated hyperthyroidism may result in ""thyroid storm "" a condition involving high blood pressure fever and heart failure. mental changes such as confusion and delirium also may occur."
hi ok it seems if you already have one type of hsv it is harder to get the other type. thats because the virus causes the body to produce antibodies that provide some crossover protection against the other type should it entering the body. thats why when a person with a prior hsv infection does contract the other type the first episode tends to be less sever than in a person who has no prior antibodies. hope this helps you. good luck
i was exposed to poison ivy when i was a teenager and after taking steroids it went away but it comes back most years (i am now <positive_smiley> and some years it returns  or  times without any exposure to poison ivy plants. it starts in my wrists and ankles with small bumps and in a day or two can spread to most of my arms and legs. sometimes it even spreads to my face and abdominal area. when it becomes really severe i go to the doctor and get steroids and have also done really long tempers (take medicine for about a month decreasing dosage each time until it is finished). it always comes back regardless of the amount of medication and shots i am prescribed by doctors. which clearly indicates it must be in my bloodstream and remains there. to deal with itch i use benadryl gel and white vinegar but over the years have tried pretty much every product available over the counter recommended for poison ivy and others that are not. it still itches and over the years i have definitely become more tolerant of the itchiness but wish there was a cure. doctors keep telling me i have to be exposed to it every time in order to get it which is clearly not the case. i wonder what damage if any it is causing in my body. i sympathize with those who get it. i hope someone studies this one day and finds a cure!
up until fairly recently the only way to reverse sun damage was to have laser treatments chemical peels or use retinols and prescription tretinoin creams. a revolutionary innovation in the cosmeceutical industry is changing that. now all you may need to do is go to your drugstore or department store and look for products that contain dna repair ingredients. these ingredients now come in every product imaginable — creams lotions serums sunscreens. and heres the wonderful thing: they really do work. dna skin repair ingredients are usually based on enzymes derived from a variety of sources including plankton and plants. most of the major skin care companies are already selling dna repair products and are closely following the new research. all these products seem to improve the skin so it is not necessary to buy the most expensive one. these enzymes work by restoring dna that has been damaged by free radicals most often caused by sun exposure pollution and other environmental factors. dna damage is what causes sagging wrinkles and rough-textured skin. in other words its what makes you look old. dna repair products dont seem to fade brown spots though and though they soften fine lines they wont have the dramatic effect of botox or hyaluronic acid fillers that plump deep creases. still people really notice a difference after a few weeks of using these products and they are usually happy with the results. one of the advantages of most dna repair products is that unlike tretinoin and retinols (which should only be used at night) they do not interact with sunlight and can be used during the day. in fact a few sunscreens already include dna repair ingredients. although the research is still coming in this may be the wave of the future in sun protection.
all of the symptoms you are experiencing are signs of infection and are a real emergency that can get worse. i would get to a dentist as soon as possible. these types of infections can be quite painful and end up with a hospitalization or worse.
starting in  the affordable care act changes the eligibility rules for medicaid so generally people who haven't qualified before may do so now. the deciding factor is income. if you earn slightly less than $  annually you can qualify. but here's the rub -- a number of states including florida -- have declined to expand medicaid under the new law. that means people like yourself who might otherwise qualify for medicaid coverage won't have that as an option. however if you make roughly $  or more you can look to your state's health insurance marketplace which will open october . you'll be able to shop for health insurance and if you qualify you'll get a tax break to help cover the cost of a health plan. if your income is very low the price break could be quite substantial. in addition you may also qualify for subsidies that will lower your costs each time you go the doctor. i suggest you check out the state pages here at webmd which will give you a good idea about the details of what will be available to you in florida. also sign yourself up for information about the marketplaces at healthcare. gov. good luck!

since the heart is the pump that supplies oxygen from your lungs and since you are getting out of breath with minor exertion seeing a cardiologist is a good next step. you may need an exercise treadmill test with attached to an electrocardiogram oxygen sensor and ultrasound. i don't think this important evaluation to rule out a heart-related cause would be a waste of money.

"most infants transition to whole milk at  months assuming they are eating well from the table and do not have any sensitivity to milk and milk products. milk is just one source of nutrients in a child's diet but cow's milk and soy formula are not bio-equivalent. i don't know why your child is on soy so i really can't give you the ""okay"" to start whole milk. you will need to talk to her pediatrician."
different diet pills contain different ingredients that have different mechanisms. certain ones favor the blocking of absorption via the intestines while others increase the metabolism thus taking care of the excess of calories. because of the large offerings available you might want to consult a nutritionist on a specific pill available to you. in the end have in mind that dieting is not recommended for people who suffer from certain diseases so you might want to consult your family doctor about being on diet and whether or not it is good for you.

mymox (amoxicillin) is an antibiotic and has nothing to do with lactation or milk production. sudden weaning of baby may lead to both physical and emotional effects on both the mother and her baby. gradual weaning is good. medical suppression of lactation is not advised due to accompanying untoward effects. try doing the following. try using supportive padded bras. manual expression of the milk just enough to relieve pain or engorgement. do not empty the breasts at a time. frequency and time for emptying vary. for more information consult an internal medicine physician online --> <link>
in my opinion. it is most probably migraine headache and to a lesser extent sinusitis. a ct scan is a good diagnostic tool to rule out any other pathologies. try. triptan medications which include sumatriptan (imitrex) rizatriptan (maxalt) almotriptan (axert) naratriptan (amerge) zolmitriptan (zomig) frovatriptan (frova) and eletriptan (relpax). sleep well and drink plenty of water. if no progression then you will need to see a neurologist and ct brain is needed.
i have read and understood your problem. premature ejaculation is very common problem and is usually not associated with any disease. but may be due to anxiety and sometimes however may be problem with prostate gland and thyroid hormone. you can learn to control premature ejaculation by doing this exercise. pull your muscles that you pull at the end of urination for few seconds then release repeat this several times daily. another is stop-start technique: when you feel that you are going to ejaculate stop the sexual stimulation and divert your mind the penis will relax. after sometime start the stimulation again and repeat the procedure. over few months you will gradually increase your ejaculation time. most often it is a chronic problem; you have to take medicines in between and period off medicine. you can apply lignocaine gel to head of penis  minutes before sex and wipe it off before starting sex. usually medicines like dapoxetine  mg are given two to three hours before sex but you have to get a prescription from your doctor. best wishes. for further information consult a sexologist online --><link>
to drink or swim in it? if you are talking about drinking cold water then i have to tell you that ice cold water is my favorite drink. the colder the better. drinking cold water is not bad for you. i am not a big fan of swimming in cold water but some people love it. as long as you are not immersed to the point of getting hypothermia you may find it exhilarating. i find it unbearable. so swimming in cold water isn't bad if you can stand it.

hi i m not a cardiologist or anything but due to my experience with anxiety i can tell you that it had caused my heart to beat so fast that it made my chest hurt and i felt short of breath. to answer your question to the best of my knowledge arteries do not go from normal to clogged in  months unless you have risks such as family history of heart disease not being active and eating unhealthy foods (high in salt and fat). i would recommend however to call up your cardiologist and ask for yourself to get checked out again just to be sure.

this sounds just exactly like an issue that i dealt with for months in . hubby and i went on vacation and on the last couple of days i was having an itch right at my waist line in the back. it wasn't too bad and i didn't think too much of it at the time. it would come and go. the day we got home it got worse. i looked in the mirror and there was a couple of spots each about the size of a quarter that looked like hives. i put an ice pack on it to relieve the itching and after half an hour or so it went away. over the course of about  months my nutritionist and i tried and tried to figure it out but it would just come and go several times a day. sometimes on my arms other times it was on my stomach or legs or back. very random. at times it would be circular in shape. other times it would show up as long lines or irregular shapes. definitely looked like hives though. then suddenly it just stopped. i realized one day that it had been a week and no new out breaks. it started on our vacation in august  and ended sometime around november/december . then just this past week it happened again. i noticed my arm pits itching a little one evening but again didn't think much of it. wasn't too bad just a little annoyance a couple times. the next morning i woke up to bright red pits and the same hive looking spots on my stomach. i started thinking about what was different during the time that i didn't have the hives. the only thing i could come up with was the while on our vacation last year we had lots of specialty coffee drinks from a famous coffee shop that i won't name here. i continued to have them several times a week until sometime in the fall don't remember when. just last weekend we decided to have them again a couple times that weekend. large ones. two days later the hives were back. that makes me sad but i guess maybe i need to lay off the expensive coffee drinks and just have my coffee here at home. it can be different things for different people but thought i would mention this just in case it might help someone else. i never thought at the time that my coffee drinks could be the problem (and it may just be a coincidence) but for now i think i'll avoid them.

surgery is one of two main treatments for early-stage prostate cancer. radiation is the other. surgery may be done to remove the prostate and its cancer. it may done to remove and test lymph nodes in the area to see whether the cancer has spread. it also may be done to fix urinary problems that are caused by a tumor pressing on the urethra. the stage of your prostate cancer along with your age and general health will affect the type of surgery you choose. surgery choices radical prostatectomy is an operation to remove the entire prostate and any nearby tissue that may contain cancer. it can be done as open surgery through an incision (cut) in the belly or as laparoscopic surgery through several very small incisions in the belly. laparoscopic surgery is done with a tiny camera and special instruments to remove the prostate. sometimes lymph nodes in the area also are removed so that they can be checked for signs of cancer. this is called a lymph node biopsy nerve-sparing surgery helps preserve the nerves that are along the side of the prostate and that are needed for an erection. this is only done when there is little chance of leaving cancer cells behind. if you already have sexual function issues nerve-sparing surgery may not be the best choice for you. laparoscopic surgery is most often done by hand. a few doctors now do this surgery by guiding robotic arms that hold the surgery tools. this is called robot-assisted prostatectomy. what to think about removing the prostate can cause erection problems and bladder problems. but for many men these problems get better over time. if you and your doctor decide that you need surgery be sure to choose a highly skilled surgeon at a hospital that has a good success rate. studies show that men have fewer side effects from prostate surgery when they have a skilled and experienced surgeon.  surgery may completely remove your prostate cancer. but it is not possible to know for sure before surgery whether the cancer has spread beyond the prostate. when cancer has spread it cannot always be cured with surgery alone. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.

what you are describing is what i think a blood boil. most people get them like under the arm where you sweat are inside the leg near the scrotch or vagina area. and they can be very painful. my suggestion is to sit in a warm tub of water for as long as you can to get it soft do not put soap in it but put something like lysol the concentrated kind it will kill the germs and it will help as an disinfectant. it will keep the infection down;. it may break on its own and if it does it will have some pus and maybe some blood. in a tub a warm water as warm as you can stand it put about  capfuls of lysol only the kind that is concentrated it should come in a brown bottle. you might could find it in a drug store or in a grocery store where the laundry soap is found. but that is only a temporary fix. if it doesn't pop on its own then go to a doctor he will likely look and see exactly what it is and prescribe antibiotics to help it go away. i went to a doctor cause i had something similar and she popped mine and then she prescribed some medicine and then it went away and i have never had one since. so please seek treatment whatever you feel like is the best option and please let us know what you decide to do. i do hope that you get to feeling better and please keep us informed of your health. we do care and we want to help. thank you

in my practice i recommend that women start with a baseline mammogram at age . then they do their next mammogram at  and then we do them yearly after . we see a lot of breast cancer between  and  and we try to even increase the mammograms with breast sonograms so it enhances a pickup in breast cancer because as you look at the breast before  a lot of them are dense and you cant really pick up a lot on the mammogram so the breast sonogram is a great adjutant to your mammogram. do you ask your doctor for that if they dont give it to you? i have my patients go for mammograms and we fight to get them breast sonogram because the insurance companies are not great about paying for breast sonogram but having had picked up many breast cancers from the breast sonograms i encourage the patients to go for breast sonograms.

when looking for a therapist it is important to find one that is qualified affordable and that you can connect well with. when you first talk with a therapist (either on the phone or in person) consider it an interview to see if the person is right for you. ask about their credentials making sure that they are a licensed psychiatrist psychologist social worker or counselor. offer a thumbnail sketch of your issue and ask if this is the kind of issue that they treat and have expertise with. ask what their approach is and why they think it would be helpful for you. as you listen to these answers think about whether you feel comfortable not only with what they are saying but also with how they are saying it. in terms of finding someone you can afford you might want to try a local clinic hospital or teaching institution (a school that trains therapists might have its own clinic) because they might have a sliding scale. although those in training are less experienced (a downside) and might make you think twice about going they also receive supervision-- and sometimes the training is for experienced people working on a more advanced degree. again if you feel comfortable that is most important (along with proper qualifications). you might want to check with the self-help support group clearinghouse for both self-help groups and recommendations for where to seek sliding scale professional help. try the state or local professional associations (i. e. for psychologists or social workers) and ask if they can direct you. and whoever you call for help if they cannot help ask if they can direct you as to where to get help.

you've done the right thing by coming here and asking about your phobia because actually this is exactly the type of fear that can be overcome. you've already taken the first two crucial steps to overcoming this phobia: . identifying it; . asking for help. the next step i advise you to take is to contact a counselor or psychotherapist. you may be pleased to learn that advances in treating phobias over the past couple of decades have made it possible for many people to overcome their fear of things like needles in just a few sessions with a therapist. obviously the length of treatment time will vary with each individual. but my goal here is to reassure you that you need not believe you'll need a lifetime of psychotherapy to overcome this. it's probably not true at all! you obviously understand how important it is to get an annual blood draw especially at your age. our analysis of people's blood allows us to detect all kinds of medical conditions that may require treatment. and please don't feel awkward or ashamed about approaching a therapist for help with your issue. this is not an uncommon fear and any medical professional will admire you for finally coming to terms with your phobia and wanting to conquer it. i wish you all the best!
"first i'm very sorry to hear of your loss. my sympathy to you and your family. as to your question it sounds like you're asking about the ""manner of death"" listed on the death certificate. in general a death certificate has a section called ""cause of death "" which lists the direct event that led to a person's death such as ""myocardial infarction"" (heart attack). the death certificate usually also has a section called ""manner of death "" which often consists of checkboxes labeled ""natural "" ""accident "" ""homicide "" ""suicide "" ""undetermined "" etc. generally speaking a perforated bowel would be considered a ""natural"" death. a ""natural"" death usually is one that arises from a disease process or aging. keep in mind i am not a physician or lawyer. i'm just offering information based on my best knowledge of death certificates. if you have questions about your mother-in-law's death certificate you can consult the physician who certified the death certificate. his or her name should be listed. the centers for disease control (cdc) has a page on its website about how to fill out a death certificate. i am unable to link to it here but a search of their site should reveal it. again i'm very sorry for your loss."

well your symptoms certainly warrant a checkup. what you're describing could be something as benign (non-life threatening) as a cyst or something more serious. the fact you've had pain and swelling in the area plus a fever could point more to an infectious process than to something like cancer but only a physical examination by a medical professional can say for sure. and either way this lump seems to need treatment. i'd suggest you make an appointment with your primary health care provider as soon as possible to get this lump looked at. wishing you all the best!

"melatonin should be effective in regulating sleep in people with hypothyroidism. the question is does it make hypothyroidism worse or cause unwanted side effects in patients with auto-immune disorders. the jury is divided on the potential benefits vs. possible drawback of taking melatonin by patients with hypothyroidism. - one group of clinicians believes that melatonin is important for cell growth and has positive thyroid benefits. - other researches believe that hypothyroidism caused by an underactive thyroid gland is an auto-immune disorder (i remember seeing a warning on a bottle of melatonin that it should not be taken by people with auto-immune disorders). studies have suggested that the taking of melatonin by individuals with an auto-immune disorder stimulates inflammation within the body. cited were arthritic patients who condition worsened after taking routine dosages of melatonin. an article in livestrong states "" it (melatonin) may also down-regulate the activity of the thyroid gland. so melatonin could worsen hypothyroidism. "" i would tend to err on the side of caution and not recommend your taking melatonin for sleep or thyroid treatment without consulting your medical professional. synthyroid medication works well in controlling hypothyroidism. other mechanisms are available to treat sleep disorders including herbal teas and positive sleep hygiene techniques. please consider talking with a doctor about this topic. your physician may have their own feelings about your taking melatonin."

"you should not have to ""pester"" your doctor to get care. he is not doing it for free. you or your insurance company is paying him. at this point you may need to ask for a referral to a neurologist for a higher-level neurological evaluation."
the symptoms of hypothyroidism are often subtle. they are not specific (which means they can mimic the symptoms of many other conditions) and are often attributed to aging. patients with mild hypothyroidism may have no signs or symptoms. the symptoms generally become more obvious as the condition worsens and the majority of these complaints are related to a metabolic slowing of the body. common symptoms are listed below: fatigue. depression. modest weight gain. cold intolerance. excessive sleepiness. dry coarse hair. constipation. dry skin. muscle cramps. increased cholesterol levels. decreased concentration. vague aches and pains. swelling of the legs. as the disease becomes more severe there may be puffiness around the eyes a slowing of the heart rate a drop in body temperature and heart failure. in its most profound form severe hypothyroidism may lead to a life-threatening coma (myxedema coma). in a severely hypothyroid individual a myxedema coma tends to be triggered by severe illness surgery stress or traumatic injury. this condition requires hospitalization and immediate treatment with thyroid hormones given by injection. properly diagnosed hypothyroidism can be easily and completely treated with thyroid hormone replacement. on the other hand untreated hypothyroidism can lead to an enlarged heart (cardiomyopathy) worsening heart failure and an accumulation of fluid around the lungs (pleural effusion).

you should be ok. you want to make sure that you keep your pet's medication in a separate area from your medications including vitamins and over-the-counter medications. also make sure you are familiar with what your pills look like before you swallow them. always better to be safe than sorry.
many medications are safe to split. because of this insurance companies and doctors are increasing prescribing higher dose scored tablets as a cost savings for patients. yet some medications are compromised when they are split and this should not be done. for example capsules or tablets without a score or pills with an exterior coating shouldnt be split. splitting these medications could result in uneven doses of treatment and can causes harm under-treatment or inadvertent overdose of medications. to see if your medication can be split check the how supplied section of the package or ask your pharmacist. yes you can cut them in half. i just called my own pharmacist and asked this very question today and was told i could absolutely cut it in half. i don't see why not. i wouldn't recommend taking less than the doctor perscribed though. if it's a tablet then use a pill cutter or a thin knife to cut it in half. if it's a capsule or something else i don't think it can be cut in half. hope this helps!
due to the fact that my dr had me on / hydrocodone/acetaminophen  x day for a few years my liver test were extreamly high. he even called me personally and asked if i was alive (not funny at the time). he switched me to  oxycodone and no acetaminophen what-so-ever. ibuprofen is all i'm allowed. though my case may be rare i don't recommend acetaminophen to be taken daily ever. be sure you know the warning signs as i was vomiting alot and very tired all the time for no reason.
"when there is too much cholesterol in your blood it builds up in the walls of your arteries. over time this buildup causes the arteries to harden -- a process called atherosclerosis. the arteries become narrowed and blood flow to the heart muscle is slowed down or blocked. the blood carries oxygen to the heart and if enough blood and oxygen cannot reach your heart you may suffer chest pain. if the blood supply to a portion of the heart is completely cut off by a sudden blockage the result is a heart attack. there are two forms of cholesterol that most americans are familiar with: low-density lipoprotein (ldl or ""bad"" cholesterol) and high-density lipoprotein (hdl or ""good"" cholesterol). these are the forms in which cholesterol travels in the blood. ldls have little protein and high levels of cholesterol and hdl has a lot of protein and very little cholesterol. ldl is the main source of artery clogging plaque. hdl actually works to clear cholesterol from the blood. triglycerides are another fat in our bloodstream. research is now showing that high levels of triglycerides are also linked to heart disease."
it depends on why you are taking it. if it is for  deficiency then you take vitamin  but with a doctor's guidance to monitor blood levels. if you are taking it for high blood levels of homocysteine or to prevent age-related macular degeneration then you take a combination of  folic acid and pyridoxine. for more information on dosing side effects and interactions see this link.
yes if you truly had strep throat and you were taking the proper dosage for your weight and for the proper length of time. most sore throats are not strep so if you are self-diagnosing and self-treating i would caution you against doing this.
"the cause of your acne that is worsening is not as important as the treatment. cystic acne is the type most likely to scar and most likely to need the services of a good dermatologist. there are some wonderful medications available that can get your acne in control. at age  both male and females have ""ranging hormones"" which is really the number one cause; a cause that cannot be rectified at this time in your life since your hormones are providing some other essential functions right now. if you are female certain oral contraceptives can help regulate those zit-causing female hormones. for men there are no options to regulate testosterone; the male hormone. think of your acne as a temporary side-effect."
hi endometriosis seems less likely. such changes usually occur if your body is undergoing severe hormonal changes during periods. this does happens at this age and is usually known to recover spontaneously. taking anti spasmodics will help. a ultrasonography of abdomen is surely indicated. thanks
