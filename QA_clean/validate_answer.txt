i'd suggest you take another home pregnancy test. and do it first thing in the morning when your urine is most concentrated. your spotting could indeed be implantation bleeding. or it could be the arrival of your period. only the home pregnancy test can tell for sure! if you take another pregnancy test that comes up negative but you fail to have a regular period i suggest you consult a gynecologist to find out what's going on. a number of factors could cause you to skip a period and yet not be pregnant. your gynecologist can sort through the possibilities and figure out what's going on. wishing you all the best for a positive test!
medicare is always your primary. i don't believe you have a choice.
the most common reason for this is a foreign body usually food. your three-year old for some reason decided it was a good idea to put a green bean pea or? in the nose. if there is a bad smell and a nasty drainage from just one-side this is the most likely reason. nasal foreign bodies can be challenging to remove so it may be a good idea to allow the medical provider to do it for you.

yes it can be anal fissures. also you can look for a skin tag around perianal area which occurs in anal fissure. does the child have constipation or tight stools? because if it is an anal fissure then we will have to see the cause of hard stools as the difficulty to pass stool can cause fissures. he should also be checked for hypothyroidism. is there any blood in stools? most likely it is anal fissure. the rest all can be said on examination for which you should see a pediatrician. for further doubts consult a paediatrician online 
there seem to be a lot more obsession questions over the years about penile implants and penile size ejaculatory volume and issues that arent really so much health issues but more concerned with personal image. things are changing. people now no longer seem content with who they are and they want to be something else. and so were trying to figure out why that this is going on. the only thing that several of us have been able to come up with is its the internet. and pornography and that young guys and women are seeing men who are not normal maybe particularly healthy you know what i mean well-endowed not anything that they will ever see in their lives and they now compare themselves to these porn stars. and they look down there and they dont see something that impressive and they dont understand why theyre not that way. and the answer is because very few people are that way. thats not necessarily the norm. (butt) that applies to ejaculatory volume frequency of ejaculation erection size girth length what you do how you do it what it is that youre supposed to do. young teens im sure are seeing images and thinking thats what im supposed to do. and its changing things. its bad for the guys its bad for the females. sex is no longer this romantic special bond it becomes this act that youre supposed to do trying to follow some bizarre video that was sent to you online.

to be safe pregnant women should avoid high-risk sexual behaviors. here are some important precautions: the absolute safest route of course is to avoid sex if your partner has a sexually transmitted disease such as hiv herpes genital warts or chlamydia. these infections can be transmitted to your baby during intercourse. some couples choose to use condoms and practice safe sex. avoid sex or use condoms if you're not absolutely sure about your partner's sexual history and there's a possibility of an unknown or undisclosed std. some experts suggest you should avoid having your partner blow air into your vagina if you engage in oral sex. it could send a dangerous air bubble into your bloodstream. if you use lubricants use a water-soluble product such as astroglide or ky jelly.
that is a possibility but you would need to see your health care provider and be properly tested to be absolutely sure. symptoms alone are not sufficient to know if you acquired an std or not. if you were having unprotected sex with someone that has or may have other sexual partners your risk of an std greatly increases so i would suggest that you be properly examined and have a few screening std tests. your symptoms do not necessarily mean you have an std. there can certainly be other reasons. but for your peace of mind it would be nice to know that you do not. next time. if there is a next time. insist on condoms.
your symptoms are severe but it is advised to get physiotherapy before you think about surgery.
"i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it's annoying when our joints don't work correctly! you may be spot on when you say your knee joint feels like it's full of fluid. that could be exactly what's going on. many things can cause the knee joint to temporarily fill up with fluid. as long as you have no signs of a deep vein thrombosis (dvt) such as heat pain and angry redness to the calf area you probably can take a wait-and-see attitude. if the pressure and stiffness in your knee is accompanied by a ""lump"" on the back of your knee (where the leg bends) you could have a baker's cyst. this type of cyst can be caused by osteoarthritis or an injury. a baker's cyst can be easily diagnosed by mri though some medical professionals can tell simply with a physical examination. these cysts often are easy to feel. since you don't have a fever you can be relatively assured there's no infection process going on. if resting and elevating the knee don't cause the pressure to go away you should consider a visit to your primary care provider for an evaluation. wishing you well!"
"you'll probably need to see a dermatologist, a doctor who specializes in skin conditions. they'll ask about your past and current health problems, your history of severe sunburns or indoor tanning, any pain or symptoms you're having, and when the spot first appeared."
yes you can get a tdap.
i can't offer you a definitive answer since i have no way of examining you over the internet but this could be a small spermatocele unrelated to your varicocele. i would suggest that you see your medical provider so that you can be properly examined and diagnosed. if you do have a lump on the testicle itself this will need to be confirmed.
you should immediately consult a doctor because there are a lot of reasons for this starting from hormonal imbalance to cancer. its always better to get tested as early as possible
yes it is normal it could take a week to a week in a half to fill normal agin it just the meds running there course but it will be fine
so sorry to hear you're going through this. ouch! unfortunately soft tissue injuries like sprains can take a long time to heal. the fact your ankle is still black and blue after a week tells me this was a pretty serious sprain. it's going to take your body quite awhile to repair the damage. keep resting the ankle keep elevating it as much as possible and follow the other instructions you were given. if you're not able to bear weight on the ankle within the coming week i'd recommend going back to the doctor. it's always possible there's a little fracture in there that couldn't be seen on x-ray due to swelling when you were first examined. (assuming you had an x-ray initially. ) i know it's hard to be patient but keep in mind that trying to rush the healing process can actually aggravate the injury  which will take even longer to heal. i wish you all the best!

hi these findings are suggestive of a weak heart. the fact that he has an abnormal ecg and old age are responsible. he has valvular heart disease affecting 3 out of the 4 valves coronary arteries seem to be blocked and his ejection pumping heart capacity is just 45 %. this should be atleast 60-70 %. he needs to consult a cardiologist and start on inotrophic drugs. healthy exercises yoga and meditation will help to some extent thanks
most helpful answer no. this cannot be re-glued (or sutured) after five days unless the wound is re-cut. you are most likely going to be stuck with a scar as this wound must heal naturally now. this is why i hate and never use dermabond especially in an area where there is tension. dermabond is for lazy medical providers and those who are not skilled in suturing. it has a place but in very very few situations. suturing is almost always a better choice. i am very sorry that happened to you and that you were given the improper instructions (dermabond should not get wet in a shower). scars can be improved by plastic surgery so if you are cosmetically scarred in about a year this may be what you have to do. the body has a remarkable ability to repair damage however so things may look fine a year from now. go back to the hospital
it is probably something minor and easily treatable but it sounds like more than a common cold. i would definitely take her to the doctor and keep giving her the benadryl. make sure you keep plenty of benadryl on hand even when they aren't sick and i would definitely want to take her to the doctor to have that rash looked at

chemotherapeutic agents or chemotherapy are anticancer drugs. they are used (for hormone resistant prostate cancer) as a palliative treatment (palliation to relieve symptoms) in patients with advanced cancer for whom a cure is unattainable. recall that the goal of palliation is simply to slow the tumor's growth and relieve the patient's symptoms. chemotherapy is not ordinarily used for organ-confined or locally advanced prostate cancers because a cure in these cases is possible with other treatments. currently chemotherapy is used only for advanced metastatic prostate cancers that have failed to respond to other treatments. several chemotherapeutic agents have been used effectively to palliate metastatic prostate cancer. one such agent is estramustine (emcyt). another agent called mitoxantrone (novantrone) has been shown to be effective in combination with prednisone for palliating androgen-independent prostate cancer. as mentioned previously metastatic tumors that have not responded specifically to hormonal therapy are referred to as castrate-resistant prostate cancers. newer chemotherapy medicines like docetaxel (taxotere) have shown some promise in prolonging the survival of some patients with extensive prostate cancer. they may also decrease the pain related to widespread cancer. however this comes at the cost of significant side effects that may impact quality of life. the more common side effects of chemotherapy include weakness nausea hair loss and suppression of the bone marrow. the suppression of marrow in turn can decrease the red blood cells (causing anemia) the white blood cells (leading to infections) and the platelets (resulting in bleeding).

because people with the flu are contagious while they are ill and that they tend to be most contagious while they have a fever cdc advises people who are sick with flu to stay home and away from others for at least 24 hours until after their fever is gone (without the use of fever-reducing medicines). if a sick person is around others we advise that they cover their cough and everyone washes their hands frequently. most flu is spread directly from a sick person to another person. while flu viruses can be spread by surfaces contaminated with flu viruses (such as by coughing on them) this is probably not a very efficient way to spread the virus. studies have shown that human influenza viruses generally can survive on surfaces between 2 and 8 hours in usual conditions.
hi i have had ed and now free of it but take herbs spices and supplement's daily and this way can get erections when ever i want get nocturnal erections that wake me up and very good morning woods. if you want just google drugs versus herbs herbs my choice its a post of mine on www. franktalk. org its a site for guys with ed and prostate problems. on franktalk your see me as nowhard if you want you can pm me through the site if you join its free. if you want to try it do give 12 week trail as long as you not on any drugs like statins diabetic hbp or antidepressant drugs these are all the main sex killers. a lot of what i take is for the blood get your blood working right then you should get good erections. but you should really think of losing the weight you say you have get off any fast and junk foods and keep well away from sodas of any kind even diet drinks and leave energy drinks well alone. if you don't do get out and do some kind of exercising brisk walking is good for you and swimming. if you smoke now's the time to stop i did it if you love drinking just keep it down to beer and wine a glass of red wine is good for your blood and just the odd beer or two. do hope this helps you. good luck

there are other options you could look into. first have you seen a dietitian who deals with eating issues? understanding what is behind your eating tracing back to childhood could help immensely no matter what weight loss path you choose. practicing mindful eating can help a great deal and there's lots of good research showing its effective for binge eating. as for weight loss weight loss surgery has the best long-term success. newer treatments like the sleeve help to decrease hunger hormones but is less invasive then bypass surgery. i would start with a registered dietitian and look at all your options. unfortunately weight loss drugs need to be safe. good luck and don't give up!

within the first few days of an injury ice can help the process of healing. applying ice to injured tissue can cause blood vessels to shrink and this makes them less capable of releasing chemicals that lead to swelling inflammation and pain. after a few days it probably best to apply heat to sore muscles. this makes muscle spasms less likely and relaxes injured muscles. however because the events behind every injury are different speak with your doctor first.
i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. anxiety is no fun no matter what causes it! i suggest you investigate cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt). this type of therapy is issue-based and is designed to help resolve issues like yours quite quickly  often in four to five sessions. if that sounds impossible take it from me: it can happen! in a nutshell cognitive behavioral therapy helps you recognize the early symptoms of in your case an anxiety episode coming on so that you can disrupt your body's physical response to the trigger. you already know your trigger: heights. since you can't avoid the trigger cbt will teach you how to change your thought patterns and behaviors to derail the panic attack before it can get started. it sounds easy and it actually can be easy  with some practice. you can find many therapists who specialize in cbt. i urge you to find one and get started soon because there's no reason for you to continue limiting your life (and experiencing the nasty symptoms of a panic attack) for even one more day. wishing you well!
there really aren't any foods you need to avoid while taking coumadin. since coumadin works on vitamin k foods that are high in vitamin k can affect your inr (the test to measure how well your coumadin is working). foods like kale spinach collard greens and brussels sprouts all have high amounts of vitamin k. while you shouldn't binge on them one day and avoid them the next if you have one or two servings a week consistently you should not notice a difference.

with blood test results in hand your doctor will prescribe you thyroid hormone levothyroxine (levothroid synthroid etc. ) it may take a blood test or 2 to get the right dosage. but it is a very very easy condition to treat. once your tsh and t4 get back to normal you will feel much better than you do now and the babys thyroid production will be ok too. just get that hormone treatment going now.
i am a strong advocate for the flu shot (and other vaccines) so i think that everyone should get vaccinated each year. it is not imperative that this be done but it makes common sense since influenza tends to kill tens of thousands of people each year. if you skip a year for whatever reason nothing bad will happen other than the fact you will be vulnerable to getting (and spreading) this year's strains of the flu. why take the risk?
hi knock knees at your age needs surgery to be cosmetically ok. otherwise you wont have any problems with your knees for atleast 30 years from now. surgery has only benefit of making the knee straight. otherwise there are anesthesia risks. also making the bones weak. scars. implant related problems are just a few cons. better to avoid surgery. thanks

"there is always a chance of an unintentional pregnancy when you practice unsafe sex. period. even though the chance may be small it is not ""zero"". you may need to sweat it out for a few weeks to see if your partner has become pregnant or even consider having her use a ""morning after"" pill. if you and your partner lucked-out this time make sure that this mindless act never happens again. i agree with you. it was a dumb thing to do. when a man thinks with his penis and not his brain all sorts of problems can occur. from an unintentional pregnancy or the transmission of a sexually-transmitted disease. having strong sexually feelings and desires are normal for both of you but please. please. please. be smart. if you cannot abstain. if you cannot limit your sexual activity to non-genital contact. then you must always use a condom and your partner should be using another form of contraception as back up (condoms can break or slip off you know)."
this is a common question. believe it or not the medication that you are on is a combination product that uses two medications to combat pain on two different levels. acetaminophen (660 mg) is an effective pain reliever and is used in combination with the hydrocodone (10 mg). you want to take the medication exactly as prescribed by your doctor or health care provider.
sorry you're dealing with this. i definitely would have these new symptoms checked out. there may be some cause/effect between the strep and the swollen painful joints or you may have developed something else entirely. at any rate the sudden onset of the symptoms you describe in an otherwise healthy young female is reason enough to seek medical care right away. your best bet is to return to the urgent care facility where you received the strep test and injection because they'll have your medical records at hand. normally i wouldn't advise someone who believes they have strep throat to seek urgent care. it's something that can be handled by a primary care provider. take care and best wishes!

"the general answer to your question is: it depends on the medication. every drug works differently. i think what you're referring to is the ""peak concentration"" point sometimes called the point of ""peak effectiveness. "" that's the point in time at which a medication is most concentrated in your bloodstream. in the case of oxycodone the medication is released almost immediately after you take it. it reaches peak effectiveness within a couple of hours and then gradually tapers off over the course of about 24 hours. always follow the dosing instructions on any bottle of narcotics like oxycodone. if you take too much oxycodone you can stop breathing. obviously that's bad. if you have any questions about your prescription medications you can always call a pharmacist. many pharmacies are open 24 hours a day and a pharmacist will be happy to answer any questions you have about how to take your medications. hope this helps!"
a fever is the body's normal response to fighting off a pathogen (virus bacteria) or respond to inflammation. there can be hundreds of reasons for a child to get a recurrent fever but in most cases it tends to be one or more of the over 200 respiratory viruses. fevers are not dangerous but finding the reason is important so i am glad you are seeing his doctor.

hi so yes a bacterial urinary tract infection (uti) is the most common kind of infection affecting the urinary tract. urine or pee is the fluid that is filtered out of the bloodstream by the kidneys. urine contains salts and waste products but it doesn't normally contain bacteria. when bacteria get into the bladder or kidney and multiply in the urine a uti can result. i do hope this helps you. good luck

i am very sorry to hear that your mother is so sick. from your question it sounds like she is still in the hospital. before she is sent home ask her if you can talk to the doctor who is taking care of her. you will need her permission for the doctors and nurses to talk to you about her illness. this is to protect her privacy. have a list of questions ready to ask the doctor. depending on your moms health you might want answers to some of the following questions.  is there any special diet that she will be on? if so can you talk to a dietitian?  will you need any special equipment at home to help take care of your mom? (like a bedside commode or hospital bed)  will homecare nurses be coming out to help her?  will she be in any pain and if so what can you do to help her?  will she be having any further treatments?  what can you and your mom expect over the next several days or weeks? when should you call the doctor?  is she on any new medication? if so how does she take it and are there any side effects?  would hospice care be appropriate at this time?  are there any support groups for cancer patients and their families in the area? hopefully you will get all the answers that you both need. your mother is very lucky to have someone like you to be her advocate.

"most cases of alopecia areata, an autoimmune disorder that causes hair to fall out in clumps, resolve spontaneously. some doctors try to speed recovery with topical corticosteroid drops or steroid shots directly into the areas of hair loss on the scalp. the treatment may be somewhat painful and may cause skin thinning in the injected sites. prednisone, an oral steroid, may be an effective treatment for alopecia areata, but its potential side effects include weight gain, metabolic abnormalities, acne, and menstrual problems. its positive effects are often only temporary."

i'm sorry to hear you've experienced a side effect from an antibiotic. what you're describing is not uncommon. antibiotics destroy all types of bacteria including the good kind that live in your gut. this can account for the symptoms you describe. you can try eating yogurt with active cultures (for example lactobacillus or acidophilus) or you can take an over-the-counter supplement containing these flora. your pharmacist can help you figure out which product to take. these may help your natural bacteria get back in balance in your intestines. if your symptoms don't clear up within a week or so you may want to consult your health care provider. wishing you well!
i imagine you are talking about a condition called pneumothorax. the lung isn't literally exploding but a hole forms in the lung and in the lining of the lung. air can then escape out into the area surrounding the lung. the problem is this air outside the lungs puts pressure on the lungs. the lungs then can't expand and fill with oxygen. that can make getting enough oxygen in the body very difficult. when people are on a ventilator the machine is pushing air into the lungs so the chance of this happening is always higher. that's because of the pressure that can build up in the lungs. while the respiratory therapist and the doctors adjust the machine to keep the pressures down as much as possible this can still happen. the longer someone is on a ventilator the more likely problems such as this are likely to occur.
pustular psoriasis is a form of psoriasis that most commonly occurs on the hands and feet. it is not infectious and not contagious. one of the best treatments is topical puva where a topical solution is applied to the areas and then exposed to ultraviolet light for specific amounts of time. there are dermatologists and university dermatology programs that have hand/foot light boxes and would be able to offer this treatment. we also use prescription-strength topical steroids and topical vitamin d to help control the condition. it is a chronic autoimmune condition with a genetic predisposition so it is not curable but it can be well-controlled.

thrush has a cottage cheese appearance in the mouth. usually creamy white spots dot your tongue or inner cheeks. most of the people i've worked with who have thrush say it's quite painful. thrush is basically a yeast infection of the mouth. it is caused by the candida fungus. it can be caused by uncontrolled diabetes hiv or even something as simple as taking antibiotics. you may be experiencing thrush or you may have something very common called fordyce spots. these usually occur along the lip line (vermilion border) or just inside the lips. this condition is benign (not life-threatening). if your tongue is numb or painful and covered with white spots you probably should get checked out by a doctor. if you're running a fever you definitely should get checked. you can't self-treat thrush so if you do have it you need to get a prescription mouth rinse. i hope this helps!
you definitely have some challenges but you should be able to exercise. at this point you have three goals. 1. get your physicians approval to start exercising. 2. seek treatment for you patellar tendonitis. a short course of physical therapy could get you up and moving in no time. click here for some info about what physical therapy is and how they can help. 3. look for a water aerobics class in your area. its a great form of low impact exercise (easy on osteoarthritis and fallen arches). on the first day of class arrive early and explain your situation to the instructor. as long as you've been cleared to exercise by your doctor just do want you can without causing your symptoms to flare up. more then likely the instructor will be able to provide you with some alternatives. also keep in mind any movement is good movement as long as it doesn't make your symptoms worse. anytime you have an injury it doesn't matter if your an olympic athlete or just an average person you have to e ase into activity. hi ok its not such a big problem if you think about it just think sitting down and how much you can do from there if you need help see a trainer at a gym for ideas. now the next idea is to just go swimming that's if you have a pool you can get to swimming is all low impact exercising and is as good as walking for your heart and body. do hope this helps you. good luck

most helpful answer absolutely not.
actually yes. prescription vitamins are actually formulated just for pregnant women and they do contain higher amounts of certain vitamins that may not be found in over-the-counter versions especially in iron calcium and folic acid. folic acid is really important to help your baby develop especially their spinal cord and their brains. we want to make sure that women understand that they could take the over-the-counter version but they may not be getting enough folic acid. so once again talk to your pharmacist if you have any questions. we may refer you back to your ob/gyn or healthcare provider to make sure that you are going with the prescription version instead of the over-the- counter.
hi i would say from what you described would have been that sometimes a women would not even see that. look if you feel good and well and you ok then things went the way they should have you a mothers clinic near you? if so go along they could help you as most things are free. but now would be the time to really think of the bc pill then this should not happen again. remember safe sex is the best sex. hope this helps you. good luck
"as you know i cannot ""see"" your throat and examine you over the internet and unfortunately your description is really not specific enough for me to even guess. a medical provider must see these things first-hand. a mono test taken early in the course of an illness may not be very accurate so your medical provider should consider doing an ebv titer (a very sensitive mono test) if the clinical findings warrant it. a z-pack is not the treatment of choic for strep so perhaps a repeat strep culture is indicated as well (not the rapid strep test) and while you are at it a cbc (complete blood count) would be helpful information. the vast majority of sore throats are viral but sometimes this virus is mono so this diagnosis needs to be revisited."
your best way to fight premature wrinkling is sun protection. sun damage and smoking account for the majority of premature aging. in order to help combat wrinkling use compounds that exfoliate dead skin cells (glycolic and ahas) encourage new collagen deposition (tretinoin-based products) and provide nutrition for skin cells (vitamins c and e and peptides).
you were diagnosed with psychosis from merijuana? then if you smoke you'll suffer from psychosis again. did you do research as to what psychosis is how it evolves and how bad it can get? you need to look at your family and see if they have any mental illnesses. but honestly look up psychosis and do your research. a sever case can be a horrible way to live. if you cant stop smoking due to a mental illnes and you want to take the risk you should go into addiction counseling first. also look into pschizophrenia and merijuanna use in young adults. you wont find very much information in regards to developmental issues and the use of drugs. the theory is that the brain develops as you get older and if you introduce a chemical constantly to the brain the brain wont develop as well or as it could because it designed and developed itself under the use of something that shouldnt be there. it changes how it functions. its why antidepressents are bad for children. from my understanding. good luck and dont end up in a psych ward! those places arn't fun. a metaphore: developing mental illness is like falling asleep. you can never tell where it happened and the only way you knew you were asleep is when you wake up. some people never wake up or are unable to.

"the usual ""reference range"" (or normal range) for vitamin d levels in the blood is 30 to 74 nanograms per milliliter. so while your result falls within the normal range it is toward the low end. did your doctor advise you take a vitamin d supplement (or to take calcium with vitamin d added)? if not then he or she must feel you have nothing to be concerned about. however if you've been told you have osteoporosis or osteopenia then you might consider using a calcium supplement that contains vitamin d. vitamin d helps the body absorb the calcium better. if you'd like to get a bit more vitamin d in your system you can spend a little time in the sunshine every day (how pleasant! ) drink milk fortified with vitamin d or eat more saltwater fish (like cod) or liver. this article "" are you getting enough vitamin d "" might be helpful to you. if your doctor wasn't concerned enough to address your vitamin d results i wouldn't worry about it too much. hope this helps! your level of vitamin d is considered normal if it is between 30-100 according to my internist. so while yours is normal you may consider taking a regular over the counter vitamin d. mine was taken recently and my results were 17 very deficient. 20-30 is considered low. my doctor put me on 50 000 iu's once a week for 8 weeks and then 50 000 once every 2 weeks for another 8 weeks. i have been having a terrible time with my gums puffing up and bleeding ( i have always taken great care of my teeth and this is like a nightmare) chipping of several teeth without knowing it hurting all over my body and joints and losing hair like crazy along with many other symptoms. i'm 51 by the way. hope you find this somewhat helpful. any questions just let me know and i'll see if i can answer them."

"the primary medications used to treat schizophrenia are called antipsychotics. these drugs do not cure schizophrenia but help relieve the most troubling symptoms, including delusions, hallucinations, and thinking problems. older medications (commonly referred to as ""first generation""), newer (""atypical"" or second generation) drugs, and even newer atypical antipsychotics may be prescribed."
there are no magic solutions to motivation but i am pleased that you are doing this with a friend. how about a bet? put some money on the line ($100? ) or house-cleaning (if someone fails to meet their goal they have to clean the other person's house). keep in fun and make sure your goals are reasonable and achievable. start with control. cut out the things you know you are not supposed to eat and stop buying them. write down everything you eat for about a week or so (be honest! ) and try to determine the number of calories you are ingesting. make sure you are under 15 calories per pound of ideal body weight (your goal). any one can lose weight. there is only mismatched strategies. something tells me that you are on your way to success.
unfortunately yes the risk really is that big. even if you're not having an active outbreak of cold sores you're still infected with the herpes simplex i virus (hsv i) which causes the cold sores. this virus can be transmitted through any physical contact including kissing. the problem with hsv i and genitalia is that increasing evidence shows hsv i can cause genital herpes. both of these viruses are incurable and your girlfriend is rightfully concerned about being infected with a lifelong case of genital herpes by your performing oral sex on her. i wish i could offer a good solution to your problem. the only safe way for you to perform oral sex on your girlfriend is with a barrier in place. you could look into the female condom to see if it provides enough coverage for you to avoid skin-to-skin contact between your mouth and her genitalia (including the clitoris). otherwise your best bet is to avoid oral sex altogether. remember however that oral sex is just one way to pleasure your partner. if the lack of oral sex is a deal-breaker for your girlfriend then she's not the girl for you. take care!
"stress can be positive or negative, depending on the situation. positive stressors (called eustress) may include an upcoming wedding, the holidays, or pregnancy. on the other hand, negative stress (called distress) results in the full-blown stress response. if continuous, negative stress can lead to loss of productivity, health problems, and exhaustion."

have you had a history of sneak eating? here are seven steps to help you stomp out sneak eating: 1. examine your eating habits. what are your sneak eating rituals? how do you sneak eat? what kinds of foods do you choose? when youre done overeating what do you do with the wrappers or evidence of sneak eating? when are you most likely to curtail your eating because you feel youll be judged? what triggers send you flying into your secret sneak eating rituals? look at the last time this occurred to you and seek out the connections between trigger and reaction. late-night eating has a particular air of sneakiness. its dark out no ones around just you and your sneak food. how do you feel at that time? make connections. 2. write it down. the best way to look at patterns and make connections is to journal it. just whip out a computer or spiral-bound notebook and with absolute honestly write down what you eat when and under what circumstances. reading your journal usually is a real eye-opener. 3. savor dont sneak. if you feel like youre sneaking food youll scarf up food so fast youll get whiplash. stop. ask yourself: what was i thinking before i decided to sneak eat?  make connections between events emotions and actions. youre not going to truly savor and enjoy food you need to eat behind others backs. instead youre reacting to something that has occurred in your life. the goal is to savor every morsel of food not to secretly stuff it into your mouth and feel nothing but remorse guilt and shame. 4. focus on your strengths. heres where we do lots of body image work. look at your body. you have tremendous strengths there and you need to take pride in them. write down your strengths. what can your body do well? the next time you feel bad about your body whip out your laundry list of positive things you love about your body and neutralize the negative thoughts that send you into a sneak eating binge. 5. optimize your healthy lifestyle habits. to improve your body image you need to do the work to eat healthfully as well as stay physically active. living a healthy lifestyle lays down the foundation for the elimination of sneak eating. be patient. people whove been sneak eating for a long time will have to be patient with the process of eliminating this habit. old self-destructive patterns take time to be replaced with healthier progressive lifestyle habits. 6. make a commitment. if you feel that youre about to sneak eat you probably are. eating should not be accompanied by guilt and shame. make a commitment to spend the next 24 hours eating healthfully and fight the urge to take food into a secret place where you eat sneak foods. start out with a healthy breakfast and eat every 3-4 hours after that. make certain youre eating a balance of high quality protein carbs (veggies fruit whole grain) and fat. stop eating by 8 p. m. each night. get physical activity. if youre feeling stressed and anxious seek other ways to alleviate the angst. these include activities that do not involve sneak eating or self destruction (meditate breathe yoga read a book call a friend take a walk). write down your commitment and take it day by day. each successful day is a powerful experience that will help you to build a strong foundation for healthy living. 7. get help. since sneak eating is associated with body image issues sometimes we need to get help and guidance with understanding how to come to peace with our body. there are licensed social workers and psychologists who can provide the expertise youll need to achieve your goals. sneak eating is an outward manifestation of inner turmoil about your body and yourself. gift yourself with the daily patience and practice to resolve this challenge. come out of hiding. you deserve to sit up proudly at the table and savor your food and life. you can stomp out sneak eating once and for all.
"your reaction to visual stimuli is really ""normal"". inconvenient yes. but normal. there is really nothing you can really do to keep this from happening unless you wear very dark glasses and quit looking at things that are ""hot"" to you. as you get older you may be able to control your involuntary erections since you will be busy and not be thinking about sex 24/7."
scientists aren't sure what causes migraines with aura. it's thought that at least two brain chemicals  serotonin and dopamine  play a role. according to the theory something goes awry in the way these chemicals regulate brain function. this may cause the brain and the body's immune system to overreact. when this happens a flood of immune response cells flows through the blood vessels to the brain. the brain's blood vessels open wider to accommodate these cells. even more chemicals are released to help control the vessels' muscles. the vessels open and constrict. a severe often throbbing headache results. factors suspected of causing migraines with aura include genetics and being overweight. substances behaviors and environment may trigger migraines as well. it is known that migraines often run in families. they frequently begin in childhood and worsen through adolescence. although more boys than girls have migraines more adult women than adult men have migraines. over time the number of migraines lessen and they become rare after age 50. whatever the cause the good news is that  although painful  migraines with aura are not life threatening.

"there is no diet magic only sound dietary lifestyle changes. anything we do can be done in a way that's more favorable or less favorable for fm. that includes how we move how we rest what we take etc. etc. and what we eat. i favor a higher protein lower carb diet approach. here is a brief summary of suggestions i've made to patients regarding diet and fm. any specific diet for you should be discussed with your doctor. foods that are okay to eat: good proteins  lean meats skinless chicken fish & turkey.  eggs but egg whites are healthier.  tofu.  soy meat substitutes.  dairy products â use the lowfat varieties.  legumes â beans peanuts lentils peas soybeans. good carbohydrates  all vegetables. corn has more carbs than other vegetables.  fresh fruits. avoid dried fruits. good fats  preferably olive oil â other acceptable oils include plant oils soy corn peanut and sunflower oil.  almonds.  avocados.  fish oils. miscellaneous  salad garnishes.  flaxseed oil.  artificial sweeteners sugar-free beverages (in moderation). foods to avoid  breads sweets pastas white rice white potatoes partially hydrogenated oils carbonated drinks alcoholic drinks. dr. pellegrino's diet strategies:  think protein always. a key with this diet is not to eat any carbohydrate foods by themselves even if they are considered good carbs.  avoid the rush. to avoid a carbohydrate surge take a few bites from proteins first whenever you eat.  eat until full. try to eat at least three meals a day and have one or two snacks. at meals eat until you are comfortably full but not stuffed.  strict during the week splurge a little on the weekend. the diet is five days ""on"" and two days not so ""on. "" this allows people to follow the basic rules during the week but also allows the anticipation of favorite foods over the weekend."
the symptoms of heart failure can include: congested lungs. fluid back up in the lungs can cause shortness of breath with exercise or difficulty breathing at rest which is often worse when lying flat in bed. fluid and water retention. this results in swollen ankles legs and abdomen (called edema) and weight gain. dizziness fatigue and weakness. less blood to your major organs and muscles makes you feel tired and weak. less blood to the brain can cause dizziness or confusion. rapid or irregular heartbeats. the heart beats faster to pump enough blood to the body. if you have heart failure you may have one or all of these symptoms or you may have none of them. in addition your symptoms may not be related to how weak your heart is.

normally your bones are being rebuilt all the time. first old bone is removed (resorbed). then a similar amount of new bone is formed. this balanced process keeps your skeleton healthy and strong. osteoporosis is a thinning and weakening of the bones. it is common in women after menopause and may also occur in men. in osteoporosis bone is removed faster than it is formed so overall bone mass is lost and bones become weaker. therefore keeping bone mass is important to keep your bones healthy. in both men and women osteoporosis may also be caused by certain medicines called corticosteroids. at first osteoporosis usually has no symptoms but it can cause fractures (broken bones). fractures usually cause pain. fractures of the bones of the spine may not be painful but over time they can make you shorter. eventually your spine can curve and your body can become bent over. fractures may happen during normal everyday activity such as lifting or from minor injury that would normally not cause bones to break. fractures most often occur at the hip spine or wrist. this can lead to pain severe disability or loss of ability to move around (mobility).

"super glue is not a good idea. you cannot possibly dry the tooth properly and all you will do is create a thick layer of goo over the veneer. try using tooth paste or go to the pharmacy and buy fixodent. it is pink but it will make the veneer ""stick"" until you can see your dentist. the temporary cement you can buy in the pharmacy is too thick as well. it might ruin the veneer."
hello jean13. it's very good that you can reach out and talk about your issues. if you are way overweight then yes exercise is always recommended. but not always necessary in 2011 i was able to lose 70 lbs in less than 5 months by doing no exercise. a life changing experience helped me to learn the secret to weight loss and how to look at life for what it is. losing weight has to do with working less not working more. depending on how overweight you are you might not want to put too much pressure on a body that's already struggling with an amount of weight that's too much for your frame. losing weight is 100% mental. if you're mentally in it the body will follow and do its thing as long as you understand to get out of your own way. i also suffered from anxiety and depression. i beat the hell out it though. i had to take 47 pills a week. my condition got worse and worse. losing weight is about becoming aware of what you are not who you are or what others are saying or doing or what your occupation is. your body doesn't understand that stuff. trust me. i speak from experience not just reciting something i got off the internet tv or some crap story in the tabloids. i just got finished losing 15 lbs in a week and a half. no problem. i'm telling you that you're much more powerful than you think and much more powerful than you've been taught in school on tv in magazines or even in church. the greatest dietary supplements and pharmacy on the planet is already in you. it's just waiting for you to throw the switches. you are divine. know it! you are a product of nature not something that's owned by a corporation. be your own president. i'm always here if you need anything answered or just need to talk. i would like to know how much you weigh or how much you need to lose if you don't mind. keep your head up and have a glorious logical day!
if your brother was specifically prescribed a diuretic by one of his physicians who are treating his lung cancer then yes. he should take it. each person on chemotherapy is unique. often taking different types and dosages of chemotherapeutic agents and not every person would need a diuretic. your brother appears that he does. i wish your brother and family the very best on his treatment.

"no ""red hot ears"" is not usually a problem with your blood pressure but it is ""vascular"". in most cases this unusual phenomenon is just a variation of blushing  warm red blood is shunted to your outer ears giving them that red appearance. unlike other blushing this is not necessarily caused by embarrassment or other triggers; it just happens. for some people the ears can uncomfortably hot or even painful. to the very least it can be embarrassing. there is very little that you can do for this but since you mentioned blood pressure the use of a class of drugs called beta-blockers has been used for red hot ears. these are use for high-blood pressure preventing migraines and other cardiac problems. sometimes it helps; sometimes it doesn't. it would be up to you to convince your doctor to prescribe them for this purpose. red hot ears are harmless but if you consider the problem severe beta-blockers may be worth a try. there are many discussions about red hot ears on webmd's ear nose and throat community board. if the ear is red and hot only along the top two thirds or so where the cartilage is located and the tip of the ear or the ear lobe is still close to normal in color the problem could be relapsing polychondritis. this is a very rare autoimmune disease that attacks the cartilage in the body and is not limited to the ear. it can attack the trachea heart valves eyes joints and connective tissue. this can be a very dangerous disease that is very difficult to diagnose as only about 3 or so people out of every 1 million ever develop the disease. mayo clinic has a good easy to understand write up about it. if you suspect that this may be your problem after reading the mayo and/or other articles you would do well to contact a rheumatologist and mention it to him/her. be sure to bring up the name ""relapsing polychondritis"" as most doctors have never seen this disease. it took me ten years to get diagnosed. i have the same issue and i see it was suggested to try beta blockers here. given that it does not seem to be an issue to be concerned about is it worth to run the risk of beta blocker's side effects to deal with this? thanks for your answer. hi - i've had the same problem for the past 3 - 5 years; for no obvious reason one or both ears suddenly heats up most often at night. if this happens while i'm sleeping i end up with a migraine so what i do is drink a lot of water before i go to sleep - meaning i have to wake up to pee; i then also douse my ears and neck with water to cool down. kind of unpleasant but it's the only way i know to fend off a day-long fuzzy-brain headache. about the beta-blockers: i was given one (propranolol) for the migraines; took it for about 18 months but it didn't seem to make a huge difference. and it didn't have any impact at all on the hot ear syndrome. hope this helps. i had red ear syndrome and although ibcouldnt find a trigger i visited a chiropractor for a different reason. after an adjustment on my neck my ear immediately turned red. i then returned for about 5 neck adjustments and he fixed the problem. that was five years ago and i'm convinced movement in my neck was occasionally hitting a nerve."
i have had bad rotator cuffs and frozen shoulders in both shoulders. the docs had me do therapy/shoulder exercises for 6 months before i had surgery for the first one and all i did was therapy for the other with no mri on the second (although i also could only do therapy because of the cost of follow-up on the second after my insurance changed). maybe i had bad doctors and therapists but nobody ever told me that exercises would make it worse and everyone really pushed for 30 min. to hour of exercise every day to every other day. the exercises/therapy before and after my surgery performed both by myself and by professional therapists were very painful. and except for a very short time immediately after my surgery the doctor and therapists never said to limit the exercises because of the pain or that the painful exercises were possibly causing harm. although i would recommend some care obviously. the exercises you find at reputable sites on the internet are typically the same that i was given to perform. large wide bands (rubber) are used for most of the exercises for strengthening. i haven't looked for them in the store but they may be available - start with the least resistance you can get first then work up to stronger bands. the exercises should be done slowly in both directions - don't use a band that's so strong you can't control the recoil and you should be able to do ten to fifteen repetitions. other exercises can be done against a wall. i am not a doctor or medical professional so i don't have to recommend seeing a doctor. obviously it would be best to do so but i understand that decent health care isn't affordable - even with insurance.
you can weigh yourself as often as you feel comfortable doing so. getting on the scale is a good thing! your body weight will fluctuate on a daily basis depending what is going in and out so do not become discouraged if it does not go down on a day to day basis. it is usually recommended that you weigh in once each week in order to see a more accurate weight over time. get on the scale in the mornings before eating or drinking on the same day each week. also keep a log of your weights from week to week to see your changes. if you still want to weigh in on a daily basis â take a three day average to determine a more accurate reading.
the most common cause of aortic aneurysms is hardening of the arteries (arteriosclerosis) but other causes include: genetic/hereditary: there is a familial tendency to developing abdominal aortic aneurysms. peoplewith first-degree relatives (brothers sisters or parents) having abdominal aortic aneurysms have a higher risk of developing abdominal aortic aneurysm than the general population. they also tend to develop the aneurysms at younger ages and have a higher tendency to suffer aneurysm rupture than individuals without family history. genetic disease: there are also rare inheritable genetic diseases of connective tissue (tissue that make up the wall of the aorta) such as ehlers-danlos syndrome and marfan's syndrome that can lead to the development of aortic aneurysms. posttrauma: after physical trauma to the aorta. arteritis: inflammation of blood vessels as occurs in takayasu disease giant cell arteritis and relapsing polychondritis. mycotic (fungal) infection: a mycotic infection may be associated with immunodeficiency iv drug abuse syphilis and heart valve surgery.
it depends on where you are in the country and whether you are doing half a leg or full leg but it can be as little as $300 or $400 up to $500 or $600 per treatment. but when you average that out over the cost of what it would be to have the area waxed or razors and shaving and all the trouble that goes along with that oftentimes that can be a very cost effective procedure to do.
hi have had one many years ago really bad pain which may fill like its burning i would get to your doctor for a cortisone injection they do right into were it really hurts most but great when its done. any help. good luck
harmful? yes even one to two cigarettes a day exposes you to cancer-causing chemicals and tar. they are harmful to your respiratory tract / lungs as well as other body areas. if secondary smoke is known to be harmful than certainly first-hand smoke is worse. why don't you just quit now? what is this six-month crap? the sooner you stop the more likely your body will repair damage and hopefully restore your lungs to the non-smoking level that you had previously.

"in the last days or hours, your loved one may become restless and confused and have hallucinations so upsetting they may cry out, strike out, or try to climb out of bed. stay with them. try to keep them calm with soothing music and gentle touch. sometimes medication helps. the room should be well lit, but not bright. make it as quiet and peaceful as possible. constantly assure them that you're there. ironically, a loved one may also become clear-headed in their final hours."
"the lens lies behind the iris and the pupil. it works much like a camera lens. it focuses light onto the retina at the back of the eye where an image is recorded. the lens also adjusts the eye's focus letting us see things clearly both up close and far away. the lens is made of mostly water and protein. the protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and lets light pass through it. but as we age some of the protein may clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens. this is a cataract. over time the cataract may grow larger and cloud more of the lens making it harder to see. researchers suspect that there are several causes of cataracts such as smoking and diabetes. or it may be that the protein in the lens just changes from the wear and tear it takes over the years. the term ""age-related"" is a little misleading. you don't have to be a senior citizen to get this type of cataract. in fact people can have an age-related cataract in their 40s and 50s. but during middle age most cataracts are small and do not affect vision. it is after age 60 that most cataracts steal vision. who is at risk for cataracts? the risk of cataract increases as you get older. other risk factors for cataracts include: certain diseases such as diabetes. personal behavior such as smoking and alcohol use. the environment such as prolonged exposure to sunlight. wearing sunglasses and a hat with a brim to block ultraviolet sunlight may help to delay cataracts. if you smoke stop. researchers also believe good nutrition can help reduce the risk of age-related cataracts. they recommend eating green leafy vegetables fruit and other foods with antioxidants. if you are age 60 or older you should have a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once every two years. in addition to cataracts your eye care professional can check for signs of age-related macular degeneration glaucoma and other vision disorders. early treatment for many eye diseases may save your sight."

scientists aren't sure what causes migraines including migraines without aura. it's thought that at least two brain chemicals  serotonin and dopamine  play a role. the theory is something goes awry in the way these chemicals regulate brain function. this causes the brain and the body's immune system to overreact. when that happens a flood of immune response cells flows through the blood vessels to the brain. the brain's blood vessels open wider to accommodate these cells. then even more chemicals are released to help control the vessels' muscles. the vessels open and constrict. a severe sometimes throbbing headache results. factors suspected of causing migraines include genetics and being overweight. substances behaviors and environment may also trigger migraines. it is known that migraines often run in families. they frequently begin in childhood and worsen through adolescence. although more boys than girls have migraines more adult women than adult men have migraines. over time the number of migraines lessens. migraines become rare after age 50.

"" the webmd answers staff usually but you had quite a crush injury. the body has a remarkable ability to re-grow a lost or damaged nail assuming the matrix (the base of the nail that has the cells needed to regenerate the nail) has not been damaged. a damaged matrix may cause the nail to grow back somewhat deformed or have a ridge. when we lose a finger we do not grow a new one but when we lose a nail the body likes to replace it. time will tell if your nail re-grows again and comes in normally. my son just had the same accident. so i'm curious since its been a little over a year. has your sons nail grown back?"

that is the nasolacrimal duct that drains tears from your eyes into your nose. when you peel onions your eyes will water and your nose will run. when you cry your nose will run. this duct goes two ways so it is possible to have air come through when you blow your nose. this is innocent and there is really nothing you can do to correct this normal phenomena unless you want a surgeon to close this duct. then of course the tears will run down our cheek. not a good solution. though it's rare it is possible for air to come out through there. the reason why is because the tear ducts are actually connected to the top of your nasal cavity. normally when you cry some of your tears actually flow down into your nose - one of the reasons why our noses run sometimes when we cry. since it's all connected anyway you probably just have slightly larger passages between the two areas.

"the word ""arthritis"" means ""joint inflammation. "" inflammation is one of the body's natural reactions to disease or injury and includes swelling pain and stiffness. inflammation that lasts for a very long time or recurs as in arthritis can lead to tissue damage. a joint is where two or more bones come together such as the hip or knee. the bones of a joint are covered with a smooth spongy material called cartilage which cushions the bones and allows the joint to move without pain. the joint is lined by a thin film of tissue called the synovium. the synovium's lining produces a slippery fluid called synovial fluid that nourishes the joint and helps reduce friction. strong bands of tissue called ligaments connect the bones and help keep the joint stable. muscles and tendons also support the joints and enable you to move. with arthritis an area in or around a joint becomes inflamed causing pain stiffness and sometimes difficulty moving. some types of arthritis also affect other parts of the body such as the skin and internal organs. there are over 100 types of arthritis including osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis and gout."

i see this everyday in my practice and it's a real problem. this is a condition that's most likely called melasma. we used to only see it in pregnant women but what happens now is that when women take the pill and the longer they take the pill; so it's almost any contraceptive whether it's a patch or a pill that contains hormones the longer you are on that and then when you combine that with even minimal sun exposure can cause a patchy discoloration usually symmetric on the cheeks or upper lip and even on the forehead. this gets darker in the summer often fades in the winter but on the upper lip especially can look like a mustache and women just hate this. so it's important to understand the underlying cause it's hormones and sun exposure either from being on the pill or just your own natural hormones or during pregnancy. then the other part is the sun that you really have to protect against. when i say protect i don't mean if you are going to the beach. if you are just going to walk on the street get your newspaper from the corner go to the bus stop you have to have adequate protection on. wear a hat if you can try to stay in the shade when you can. this condition can be treated but it can often be difficult to treat. what we use are things like hydroquinones or ingredients that have sepiwhite or mulberry root extract or liquorice extract those are ingredients you can look for on products and as dermatologists we can also do treatments in the office. there are certain chemical peels that we can do that can help target that pigment in a very specific way and help lighten it. but if you go in the sun it will come right back.

bactrim is an antibiotic and i can't think of any reason why it would interact with any blood pressure medication but it's always good to question these things. i would suggest contacting a pharmacist. they're my go-to experts for all questions about drug interactions. when you speak to the pharmacist make sure to mention any non-prescription pills you take too such as vitamins or supplements. that will help the pharmacist give you the most accurate answer to your question. wishing you all the best!

i'm sorry you're going through this but i doubt it has anything to do with your blood transfusions. just to be clear: eczema is not something that can be transmitted through an exchange of blood. eczema is not contagious. so you can rule out that theory. i suggest you seek a medical opinion about the cause of the scaly itchy skin on your leg. it could indeed be eczema. but it might be something else altogether. a medical professional can not only diagnose the problem but also prescribe an appropriate treatment. wishing you well!
it depends on if your child is getting some through her diet. if she is eating fish at least twice a week she doesn't need to supplement with omega 3s. but if she eats no fish then it is unlikely she is getting enough docosahexaenoic acid (dha) and eicosapentaenoic acid (epa) which plays an important role in brain development. when looking at supplements check the specific amount (milligrams) of dha and epa in the product. the world health organization recommends 2-4 year old's get 100-150 milligrams of dha and epa (combined) daily. studies show most children only get 45 milligrams. always check with your healthcare provider.

in post-polio syndrome the symptoms of pain weakness and fatigue can result from the overuse and misuse of muscles and joints. these same symptoms can also result from disuse of muscles and joints. this fact has caused a misunderstanding about whether to encourage or discourage exercise for polio survivors or individuals who already have post-polio syndrome. exercise is safe and effective when carefully prescribed and monitored by experienced health professionals. exercise is more likely to benefit those muscle groups that were least affected by polio. cardiopulmonary endurance training is usually more effective than strengthening exercises. heavy or intense resistive exercise and weight-lifting using polio-affected muscles may be counterproductive because they can further weaken rather than strengthen these muscles. exercise prescriptions should include the specific muscle groups to be included. the specific muscle groups to be excluded. the type of exercise together with frequency and duration. exercise should be reduced or discontinued if additional weakness excessive fatigue or unduly prolonged recovery time is noted by either the individual with post-polio syndrome or the professional monitoring the exercise.

there are no set times for using epsom salts for this purpose. as a matter of fact i have never recommended it. what concerns me is the redness and swelling which can be signs of infection especially when it was an animal bite. i recommend that you call your medical provider or the place that sutured your hand for patient-specific advice. as you know i have no way of seeing or examining your injury over the internet.

"instructions for most psychiatric medications warn users not to drink alcohol, but people with bipolar disorder frequently abuse alcohol and other drugs. the abuse is possibly an attempt to self-medicate or to treat their disturbing mood symptoms, and they may also cause mood symptoms that can mimic those of bipolar disorder. alcohol is a depressant. that's why many people use it as a tranquilizer at the end of a hard day or as an assist for tense social situations. while some patients stop drinking when they are depressed, it is more common that someone with bipolar disorder drinks during low moods. according to the national institute of mental health, people with bipolar disorder are five times more likely to develop alcohol misuse and dependence than the rest of the population."
as you are probably aware there are many foods that have salt added as a preservative and for taste. some foods that naturally contain sodium before processing include the following (nutrition info was taken from usda database): 1 cup of milk (127mg) or plain yogurt (113mg) and 1 egg (62mg). most veggies contain minimal sodium except a large stock of celery (51mg) and a medium artichoke (120mg). shellfish like shirimp (3oz about 100mg) and certain meats liike ground beef (3oz about 50mg) also contain sodium. sodium occurs naturally in many foods and is also added in the form of salt or other sodium-containing substances. some foods that naturally contains sodium are egg meat raisin cinnamon carrot celery broccoli cauliflower tomatoes and coconut milk to name a few.

"surgery is aimed at stopping further damage to the heart and improving the heart's function. procedures used include: left ventricular assist device (lvad): the lvad helps your heart pump blood throughout your body. it allows you to be mobile sometimes returning home to await a heart transplant. bypass surgery : the most common surgery for heart failure is bypass surgery to circumvent a blocked heart artery. heart valve surgery : as heart failure progresses the heart valves that normally help direct the flow of blood through the heart to the rest of the body stretch out of shape allowing blood to ""leak"" backwards. the valves can be repaired or replaced. infarct exclusion surgery (modified dor or dor procedure): when a heart attack occurs in the left ventricle (left lower pumping chamber of the heart) a scar forms. the scarred area is thin and can bulge out with each beat (an aneurysm). a heart surgeon can remove the dead heart tissue or the aneurysm. heart transplant: a heart transplant is considered when heart failure is so severe that it does not respond to all other therapies but the person's health is otherwise good."
"i hope you told your doctor you did not stop the geodon ( ziprasidone hcl) when you switched over to latuda ( lurasidone hcl). because both of these medications are in a class called ""atypical antipsychotics "" it means they both work in a similar fashion. when you take both of them at the same time it has an effect not unlike doubling the dosage. taking too much of these types of medications can cause serious side effects. i urge you to contact your doctor before you do any more tapering of the geodon dose. your healthcare provider needs this information in order to treat you appropriately if you experience any side effects from reducing the geodon dosage. if you're having trouble sleeping your healthcare provider should address that as a separate issue. you should not self-medicate your sleep issues by taking medications not prescribed for that purpose. wishing you well!"
of course. past traumas can definitely have an adverse effect on a sexual life. this is not something that can be solved in this forum however. this person (and perhaps you as well) needs to see a compassionate counselor for help.
injectable filling material such as juvÃ©derm restylane radiance and artefill typically do not enter the circulation and therefore it would not appear to be dangerous during pregnancy. understand that the fillers and the wrinkle-softeners botox and dysport are all degraded or metabolized by the body and their end products would not be expected to be injurious any more than any other medication that the mother may be taking. however i am just against any non-essential service being rendered to a patient during pregnancy. in medicine we dont have 100% certainty as to all the interactions between drugs and the body. so why take the chance?
there can be hundreds of reasons for a change in your menstrual cycle but being 26 is not one of them. if this irregular cycle does not self-correct and it is concerning you you would need to see your gynecologist for a consultation.

i'm sorry to hear you feel your health needs are being neglected. self-diagnosis is a dicey deal. you can read all you want about adhd on the internet but you still may not have it. only a trained medical professional can give you a diagnosis because he or she will take into account your entire medical history and other factors. i don't say that to dismiss your concerns and i'm sorry if it comes across that way. this type of forum isn't useful for expressing tone of voice. you deserve to have your medical needs met. if you have talked to your mother and requested a doctor visit to be evaluated for adhd and she is not willing to do so i'd suggest you make an appointment with your school counselor or nurse to discuss your concerns. either of these individuals should be willing to work with you to help you sort out how to deal with this problem. i wish you all the best!
"it's not uncommon for a person who takes an anticoagulant (like clopidogrel; brand name plavix) to bruise more easily than others. however i'm wondering if your doctor told you to take a baby aspirin along with the plavix because that's kind of an odd combination. aspirin also is considered a ""blood thinner. "" if you decided to take aspirin on your own you should stop taking it right away and consult your doctor. in general it would be a good idea to consult your medical provider anyway. he or she may want to run some blood tests to make sure your blood hasn't become too anticoagulated. this can be risky. wishing you all the best!"

ibuprofen is used to relieve pain from various conditions such as headache dental pain menstrual cramps muscle aches or arthritis. it is also used to reduce fever and to relieve minor aches and pain due to the common cold or flu. ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid). it works by blocking your body's production of certain natural substances that cause inflammation. this effect helps to decrease swelling pain or fever. if you are treating a chronic condition such as arthritis ask your doctor about non-drug treatments and/or using other medications to treat your pain. this form of ibuprofen is intended for use by children. do not give this medication to a child younger than 6 months unless directed by the doctor. check the ingredients on the label even if you have used the product before. the manufacturer may have changed the ingredients. also products with similar names may contain different ingredients meant for different purposes. taking the wrong product could harm you.

she is coughing for a reason so the first and most important step is to find that reason. does she have asthma? bronchitis/bronchiolitis? pneumonia? influenza? there are so many reasons. there are few if any recommended medicines for cough in children. some are expectorants that cause her to cough (probably not something you are interested in) but children (especially girls. don't ask me why) cannot hock up phlegm. there are cough suppressants but these may be contraindicated since the cause of the cough is not known. some people are safely using honey to quiet a cough and certainly a humidifier is helpful. my recommendation is for you to have her properly examined. while most causes are viral a few are bacterial and require antibiotics.
a serum ferritin level is a blood test. it is not very expensive. there are no other ways to determine this level.

hi try starting with a blood test for your hormones that would be a good place to start try seeing your doctor for that. or it could be a phantom pregnancy you get all the symptoms and even a lump that grows and at the end of 9 months nothing it all just goes away you can google that for more info. good luck
to be honest i'd have this checked out. chronic tmj disorders can be caused by an injury like the one you describe. it's even possible you suffered a small fracture. at any rate the sooner you have it checked out the more effective treatment might be at heading off ongoing problems. you don't need to rush to the emergency room but you might call your primary care provider for an evaluation. he or she might want to take an x-ray just to be sure there's no break. your provider also can give you more specific information about the prognosis. good luck to you! the examination might include pressing on (palpating) the jaw muscles for soreness or asking the patient to open and close the jaw in. in most cases x rays and mri scans of the temporomandibular joint will be normal. . in many cases the cause of pain in the tmj area is temporary and disappears without treatment.

the urine should be cultured to determine the pathogen causing the infection and the best antibiotic for that particular pathogen. not all people with classic symptoms of the uti actually have one so perhaps you will need to see a urologist to look for other possibilities.
i have high blood pressure when it is up i feel tired i get mad easy. i think in some people it does cause mood changes
here are a few suggestions. i suggest anti-inflammatory tablet like voveran 75 mg (diclofenac) twice a day after meals. consult your doctor discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. for swelling use a compression bandage and ice the area for 20 minutes at a time. avoid squatting lunges and stairs till the pain subsides. also you need a good manual therapist to assess you for hamstring tightness quad weakness including vmo (vastus medialis oblique - thigh muscle) and gluteal weakness. try the above out for at least 10 days followed by three to four weeks of physiotherapy to get complete relief. for further information consult an orthopaedician and traumatologist online  
hi prolonged drug use can affect egg production and maturation affecting fertility levels. the chances of successful pregnancy depend on many factors (ovarian uterine hormonal stress etc). you should consider getting a complete infertility work-up done for partner to see if there are any underlying causes for the infertility/inability to conceive. do hope this helps both of you. good luck
for the present symptoms of pars interarticularis along with medication you should also apply ice for a period of about 15 minutes 3-4 times a day and followed by stretching exercises. a brace can also be used to relieve pain and improve symptoms. take a rest of 3-4 weeks time. in case if nothing still works then unfortunately surgery is the only option. hope this helps
yes your symptoms could have been an allergic response. not all allergic responses have breathing difficulties but most will have some degree of itching or hives. symptoms you did not mention. a swollen throat that suddenly came on after eating something certainly is suspicious of an allergic reaction. a bacterial disease especially one that would require an antibiotic would typically not come on this sudden. oral steroids can counteract an allergic reaction so perhaps that helped you. yes it can be due to food allergy. not all alergic reactions give breathing problems. in severe reactions one can get symptom of breathlessness. be cautious next time while eating stuff that you are allergic to.

most definitely. adderall is an amphetamine.
no. it is not common. actually a bit of weight gain is more common with depo provera. if you are losing weight without a logical explanation it would be wise to see your medical provider to find out why.
i am very biased towards exercise. in fact some studies have shown that exercise works as good or better than antidepressants for mild to moderate depression. i know with a busy lifestyle it can be difficult to find time for exercise. we often think in terms of being unable to find time for exercise. instead we should turn our thinking around so that we're making time for exercise. even if it's 20 minutes a day the benefits will more than pay off. 10 minutes in the morning and 10 minutes in the evening can even do the trick if that's all the time you have. ideally 30 minutes of steady exercise a few days a week is best. here's more information on how truly wonderful exercise can be for depression. if you're interested in supplements there are several that medical research has shown to be effective. the supplements that have the most evidence to support them are same and st. john's wort. studies have shown that same may work as well as antidepressants. the studies in this area aren't great but the supplement certainly shows promise. there is a lot of research showing st. john's wort can help as well as some antidepressants. it's been shown to improve mood and anxiety and improve sleep related to depression. another possibility is 5-htp which again has been shown in some studies to work as well as certain antidepressants. if you are already on an antidepressant you should definitely talk to your doctor before taking any supplement to make sure there are no drug interactions. of course if you haven't seen a doctor about your depression you absolutely should. you want to make sure that is in fact what's going on and that you're getting the right treatment based on your depression. everyone is different and you and your doctor know your body the best. the two of you can work together to tackle your depression.
you have to remember is that people who sleep well heal well. and thats a very important factor that people have to understand especially in hospital settings uh or even at home if youre not feeling well sleep is actually a healing mechanism. and you need to allow your body to have a little extra if it needs it. so you have to be somewhat careful but usually your amount of sleep is reasonably set unless youre sleep deprived alright so youre going to bed at the wrong time and getting up at the wrong time and not getting enough good quality sleep or theres a medical condition on board that may make you need more sleep. usually when you hit the age of about 18 19 years old your amount of sleep is pretty set even though many people think that as they get older they need less sleep. in truth thats not the case. what we if you looked at the total minutes of sleep that somebody gets over the course of a day they take naps which they dont count towards their sleep or they may even take unscheduled naps where they are watching tv during the day because they are not working and theyve retired and all of a sudden they are out cold.
dark circles are a problem for everybody and sleep is a critical factor that's a really good point. however there are other things that people also do to make dark circles and discoloration around the eyes. i have noticed that people who have allergies who tend to rub their eyes a lot will also have dark circles. so you have to be aware of how much you are touching your eye. otherwise it's really a matter of managing your stress getting enough sleep and drinking enough water because dehydration will also cause that change there. there's two different components that can cause discoloration around the eye. one is pigment. that's what gives your skin color. the other is blood supply. so when you have a change in either or both of those two you see that change around the eye. the skin around the eye is very thin so you notice it there before you see it on other parts of the face or body and that's just a very sensitive area. the only thing you can really do is get a good concealer. hope your kids grow up fast and learn to sleep through the night or maybe close the door tighter. as long as your kids are safe and you know they are okay i think that a little bit of discussion with your children about their sleep patterns if they are old enough might also help but you really have to get enough sleep. there is just no other way around it.
i completely emphasize with you. the problem of premature ejaculation is quite common and is distressing to a young man but is seldom discussed. see most of the time the problem is secondary to the anxiety attached to your expectations in the bed. it has been wrongly projected by unscientific magazine articles and porn that a man can last for 30 minutes or more. honestly most of the male ejaculate before 5 minutes. when you are anxious about not lasting long in bed you actually do not enjoy the act of intercourse and keep on thinking about prolonging the act without enjoying it. the preoccupation and anxiety about not lasting enough in fact cause hyperarousal and lead to premature ejaculation. moreover when the male start to thrust himself into the partner the moment he undress leads to early termination of coital act (the sexual union that takes place between male and female during insertion of penis into the vagina). there are also lots of young man who are suffering from premature ejaculation without any associated anxiety or apprehension. such men as well as you may benefit by taking oral medication like tablet dapoxetine or paroxetine before sexual act. but in your case i would like to suggest relaxation techniques like breathing exercises and progressive muscular relaxation. regarding your problem pertaining to non-retractable foreskin my opinion is that you must consult a surgeon. it is always better to remove foreskin if it is causing inflammation or itchiness. non-retractable foreskin is often associated with problems of genital hygiene that may subsequently lead to chronic infections. so make an appointment with a general surgeon. for further queries consult a sexologist online  
"but if your stress system stays activated over a long period of time (chronic stress), it can lead to more serious health problems. the constant rush of stress hormones can put a lot of wear and tear on your body, causing it to age more quickly and making it more prone to illness."
you can see them but unfortunately i cannot. dermatological problems require a hands-on examination either your primary care provider or a dermatologist. an accurate diagnosis  not something that i could blindly give you based solely on your very brief vague description  is the most important step in determining the proper treatment.
mcv stands for mean corpuscular volume. its the average volume of the bodys red blood cells measured in femtoliters (one-quadrillionth of a liter). cell-counting machines calculate mcv from a blood sample. a normal value may vary between laboratories but is usually between 80 and 96 femtoliters (fl). an mcv above 100 fl is called macrocytosis. when anemia (low red blood cell count) is also present its called a macrocytic anemia. causes of macrocytic anemia include deficiency of b12 or folic acid medication side effects alcohol abuse and certain blood cancers. macrocytic anemia can also occur in healthy people who are rebuilding their blood supply (after surgery for example). an mcv below 80 fl is called microcytosis (or microcytic anemia if the red blood cell count is also low). microcytic anemia can be due to iron deficiency blood loss (in women most often from menstruation) chronic illness or a condition causing abnormal hemoglobin like sickle cell disease or thalassemia. its not unusual to have an mcv thats slightly abnormal without any serious condition identified as a cause. often in these cases the mcv becomes normal again on its own when its next tested.
and something that you should always ask your pharmacist because you need to be careful with over-the-counter medications even while you are nursing. allergy medications like claritin benadryl and zyrtec have all been found in breast milk. because of the higher risk of adverse reactions in infants generally and for newborns and premature infants in particular antihistamine therapy is not recommended in nursing mothers.
hi. this can be early stage of recurrence of the cancer or may be an simple enlarged lymph node. if its not painful then i dont think you need to worry much. you can always aspirate it and send for histopathology to confirm what it is. thanks
"neither. canker sores (aphthous ulcers) assuming you made the correct diagnosis are self-limiting. they can hurt yet but there is little that can be done to make them go away sooner. some medical and dental professionals will use a steroid medication in a special dental paste (so it will stick to the slippery mouth tissue) but just ""no treatment"" is also a viable option since these things go away a less than a week. i don't know the age of your child or the location of this canker sore however. watch salty foods that can burn these open mouth sores but otherwise just hang in there."
"if your symptoms of depression are causing problems with relationships, work, or your family  and there isn't a clear solution  you should see a professional. talking with a mental health counselor or doctor can help prevent things from getting worse, especially if your symptoms stay for any length of time. it's important to understand that feeling depressed doesn't mean you have depression. depression involves not only changes in mood, but also changes in sleep, energy, appetite, concentration, and motivation. if you have physical symptoms like these and find yourself feeling depressed much of the time for days or weeks, see your doctor."
"blood clots (thrombosis) is are one of the most dangerous complications of pv. you might get a clot in your brain, your eyes, or your heart. clots also can block blood flow in your lungs (pulmonary embolism) and form in the large veins in your muscles (deep vein thrombosis, or dvt)."
as a clarification (could find another way): i did not take all these drugs together. in different occasions when i had fever usually caused by viral throat infection i tried them one by one each one more than once to make sure that it's the cause of diarrhea. so my question is  is there any alternative which could possibly not cause diarrhea?  or is there anything which i can take with them to avoid diarrhea?
yes post-nasal drainage from the sinuses can definitely leave a bad taste in your mouth (mostly in the mornings after a night of dripping). allergies colds environmental irritants chronic or acute sinusitis can be involved. of course there can be dental reasons as well. make sure to stay will hydrated by drinking plenty of water. if you have a cool mist humidifier use it at night for a while to see if it helps. moisturize your nose with saline nasal spray before going to bed. if this helps great but if you are having any signs of infection you will need to see your medical provider for a proper examination.

your genes can play a big role in your risk of developing osteoporosis. for instance studies show that if your parents had a history of bone fractures you're more likely to have weaker bones and a higher risk of fractures yourself. your risk of getting osteoporosis is also higher if other family members like aunts or siblings had it too. a genetic risk for osteoporosis can be inherited from either your mother or father's side. if osteoporosis does run in your family talk to your doctor. you need to take extra steps to prevent it.

as a man ages his prostate can grow larger. when a man reaches the age of 40 his prostate gland might have increased from the size of a walnut to that of an apricot. by the time he reaches the age of 60 it might be the size of a lemon. because it surrounds part of the urethra the enlarged prostate can squeeze the urethra. this causes problems in the passing of urine. typically these problems passing urine don't occur in men until they are age 50 or older. they can though occur earlier. an enlarged prostate is also called benign (noncancerous) prostatic hyperplasia. it is common and cannot be prevented. age and a family history of bph are risk factors. eight out of every 10 men eventually develop an enlarged prostate. about 90% of men over the age of 85 will have bph. about 30% of men will find their symptoms bothersome.

a swimming cap. put in the earplugs and then put on a form-fitting swimming hat to keep them in. although a cantankerous 16-month old may have other ideas. i should poll the ents out there. one ent in our group allows children with tubes to swim in home pools or bath without earplugs. he said that if the water is clean enough to drink it not going to put the ears at risk. besides the hole in the ear tubes are soooooo tiny that the amount of water that could enter the middle ear space would be extremely small. another ent requires that his patients buy specially fitted ear plugs (made by hearing-aid dispensers). kids tend to lose them in the pool so the swimming cap really helps.
gallstones are usually treated with surgery to take out the gallbladder. the traditional operation is called an open cholecystectomy. a more recently developed procedure called laparoscopic cholecystectomy is less invasive has fewer complications and is used in most cases. laparscopic cholecystectomy. during this procedure instruments and a light and a camera are passed through several small incisions in the abdomen. the surgeon views the inside of the body by looking at a video monitor. this procedure is used in approximately 80% of gallbladder removals. after the surgery the patient spends the night in the hospital. open cholecystectomy. this is a more invasive procedure in which the surgeon makes incisions in the abdomen to remove the gallbladder. the patient stays in the hospital for a few days after the surgery. if gallstones are in the bile ducts endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp) may be used to find and remove them before or during gallbladder surgery.
most helpful answer the most likely cause would be an infection. either a urinary tract infection or a vaginal infection. in your case it could be both. the urge to urinate is a primary symptom of a urinary infection but urethritis (irritation of your urethra) from vaginitis could also cause this annoying symptom. you will need to see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated.
no. this is not the antibiotic of choice.
restlessness is a common side effect of the over-the-counter products that can be used as sleep aids because the active ingredient is an antihistamine. i would advise making an appointment with your doctor or health-care provider for further evaluation and advise them of the side effect you experience with the otc products. you may require prescription medication instead because they work differently and are not antihistamines.
well to be honest with you this sounds like edema. edema is a fancy word for swelling. in this case edema would refer to fluid retention in the legs. if this is a new symptom it's worth getting it checked out by your primary care provider. many conditions can cause edema of the legs and several of them are treatable. meanwhile you can relieve this swelling by elevating your legs or wearing compression stockings (available over the counter for both women and men). if possible you might also reduce your salt intake as this can lead to swelling of the legs. hope this helps!
"aw i'm sorry for your little one. you're certainly describing the classic symptoms of constipation. luckily there are a few things you can do at home to see if you can help your child have a bowel movement. however if your child goes more than a couple of days without a bowel movement you need to call your pediatrician. one thing you can do is give your child some prune juice. unless your child has blood sugar problems (diabetes) he or she should be able to tolerate this treatment just fine. prune juice is a tried and true approach to constipation relief. the best way to ""treat"" constipation is to prevent it. feed your child a healthy diet that includes plenty of fiber from whole grains fruits and vegetables. also make sure your child drinks plenty of water and gets some exercise every day. these three components are crucial in preventing constipation. please do not give your child a laxative without consulting your pediatrician. dosing can be tricky with children and your pediatrician is in the best position to advise you about what laxative to use and what dosage to give. wishing you all the best! you may have the answer. abdominal discomfort and inability to have a bowel movement in a five year old is typically constipation (the pain may be caused by gas) or even stool-holding (a condition where the child does not want to defecate and tries to hold it. ) if the continues to have pain and is not defecating he will need to be properly examined. if constipation has been a long-term issue he will need to see his medical provider anyway or some specific dietary intervention or perhaps the addition of a stool softener in his diet."

not usually no. in klinefelter syndrome a male is born with at least one extra x chromosome. most males have one x and one y chromosome. klinefelter males have an xxy chromosomal structure. this condition usually renders these men infertile meaning they cannot father children. they can have a normal sex life however. if you suspect you (or your son) may have klinefelter syndrome your doctor can tell for sure with a simple blood test. if the condition is detected before puberty testosterone can be given to help with normal body development. i hope this provides the information you need.

you need to confirm with your insurance provider regarding coverage of investigation and consultation charges during your trial period. if these investigations are covered by your insurance provider during the trial period then these would be done for you during your visit to emergency. if these investigations are required to be done immediately then the doctors in the emergency room will get these done (as based on your examination findings and current health status) and you need to pay for them yourself in case your insurance provider does not cover these. you need not have to convince them to get these done. take care.
"i'm sorry you're dealing with all of this. it sounds miserable! while nothing's impossible it's highly doubtful the steroid treatment caused the symptoms that developed in january. even though you've been thoroughly checked out if the symptoms persist you should consider continuing to follow up on them. many disease processes develop slowly over time. this means an initial workup (all those tests you had done) won't always reveal an answer. if you get tested later something may show up. i want to add also that i wouldn't jump to a conclusion of cancer or pre-cancer. nothing in your description would lead me to think ""cancer. "" i'd just recommend following up again with your health care provider until the problem gets resolved. take care!"

i'd suggest you consult a medical professional about this. it could be something as simple as dry eyes due to the winter season but since these symptoms came on so suddenly and severely it also could be that you have developed an eye infection called conjunctivitis. until you can get this diagnosed be sure to wash and dry your hands thoroughly many times a day especially before touching your eyes. if this is conjunctivitis it's highly contagious. even if it's not pinkeye you don't want to risk spreading any possible infection to others. hope this helps!

herpes zoster is a group of small red sacs or bubbles on the skin.
i can't tell if you mean you haven't had a period in 10 months and now you're bleeding or if you just stopped your hrt and now you're bleeding for 2 weeks. either way. yes if you have been bleeding for 2 weeks you should see your doctor. your body may need help adjusting to stopping the hrt (if you recently stopped it). your doctor may need to give you something to stop the bleeding. the concern would be that if you're losing a lot of blood you could develop anemia. so at this point the bleeding may need to be stopped and that requires a visit to your doctor. if you haven't had a period in 10 months and you're bleeding now you definitely need to be seen to determine what's causing the bleeding.
since food is the major source of infection close attention to diet is of foremost importance in the prevention of travelers' diarrhea. foods should be well-cooked and served warm. raw vegetables uncooked meat or seafood and other foods maintained at room temperature should be avoided. dairy products tap water and ice (including frozen drinks not made from filtered water) are also high-risk foods. carbonated beverages beer and wine hot coffee and tea fruits that can be peeled and canned products generally are safe. the risk for developing diarrhea increases when eating at restaurants and when purchasing food from street vendors. also frequent hand washing with soap and clean water will decrease the likelihood of the bacteria's spread.

the thermos could have had something in it from before. you may want to sanitize it with a mild bleach solution then let it air out well. i frequently store non boiled water over weekends or longer and have never had such an issue. the worst i ever get is that the water tastes bad after a few days or the interior walls of the bottle get slimy. you could have caught something from the gym too since it's an enclosed space with lots of people in it.

"take a warm shower before bed every night. wash your hair with shampoo for scalp psoriasis (with tar, ketoconazole, or salicylic acid). if your doctor gave you medicine to use during your shower, put it on your wet scalp before you shampoo. leave it on for the prescribed period of time, then wash and rinse. always use conditioner to help keep your skin moist. after your shower, gently rub any creams or scale softeners into your scalp. put a dry shower cap over your hair before bed. this will keep it damp and hold medicine in."

the devices work best for children who:
maybe it's not ringworm (tinea corporis). there are many round (annular) skin lesions that mimic ringworm so if your child is failing on the current treatment regime seeing a dermaologist for confirmation would be advisable. antibiotics would have absolute no effect on a fungal infection. you can use the zyrtec for itching if you want. the clotrimazole is an effective anti-fungal but it can take a month to get true tinea infections in control.
pain in the intestines increase with stretching so as you grow up clips gets stretched causing more pain also there is the possibility of autoimmune reaction or infection that is if you are having hot flushes or fever any way it was right not to remove the clip as it should not do any complications good luck
yes. it is very possible that there can be an ear infection even if everything looked ok 2 days ago. it is very common for a cold to lead to an ear infection in children. the eustachian tube drains the fluid out of the middle ear into the back of the throat. a cold can cause this tube to become inflamed and swollen. this traps fluid in the middle ear. this fluid can then get infected with bacteria or viruses causing pressure and pain. webmd has a good slideshow that shows what happens with an ear infection.  so give her doctor a call now. he or she can help your daughter get some relief. i hope she feels better soon!
pap tests are better now at detecting hpv. you could have gotten this virus from any of your former partners years and years ago and it is only now that changes are being detected on your cervix during a pap. past normal paps are good but that does not mean you had a recent exposure. don't start pointing accusatory fingers at anyone just get properly treated. there is really no way to determine who did it or when you were infected by this virus.
"tubal ligation is a sterilization procedure that renders you unable to get pregnant. in tubal ligation the fallopian tubes are cut or blocked which makes it impossible for a sperm to reach an egg or for an egg to reach the uterus. since you had a tubal ligation procedure it's not likely you're pregnant. that said you should call your health care provider's office before the novasure procedure to let them know your period is late. they will be able to advise you regarding what steps to take (such as whether or not they want you to take a pregnancy test). on a broader note i wanted to say i hope you did not discontinue your medications without the supervision of a health care provider. conditions like high blood pressure often don't clear up on their own. if you still have blood pressure or depression issues you would be well-advised to obtain medical treatment to ensure your health and well-being. best of luck to you! i had my tubal ligation almost 16 years ago. i am currently 25 weeks pregnant. believe me i was stunned! but the doctors said that it can happen and i am evidence of that. our daughter destiny grace will be joining us around august 27th and although there are some health concerns considering that i'm a 3 time cancer survivor and about to turn 40 we are expecting a healthy baby girl. it was not an tubal pregnancy she made it directly into the womb and has been there from the start! i have a friend and she had her tube tied for 17yrs. she got pregnant and couldn't belive it. neither could i her tube came untied. so yes you could be pregnant. you could be going through mood swing and hot flases and still be pregnant. no one do not know your body who are they to judge only god and mother nature know best. good luck! it is possible to get pregnant after a tubal ligation. especially if you had the tl during a c-section. the fail rate for a tubal ligation is around 1 percent but goes up after ten years or if you had the tl during a c-section. sometimes the tubes reattach themselves or a fistula forms. although tubal pregnancy rates are higher if you had a tl than if you didn't have the ligation it is not ""more likely"" that you will have a tubal pregnancy than a successful one. if you are pregnant it would not ""most likely be ectopic. "" it's simply more likely than if you had not had a tubal ligation but the odds are still in your favor. i believe the chances of a woman without a tubal ligation has a 1 in 400 chance of an ectopic pregnancy but now you might have a 1 in 100 chance. so the odds are still quite in your favor but technically you're ""4 times more likely than you were before"" the tubal ligation. make sense? if you had clips put on your fallopian tubes they can fall off. and ties can break. but it's rare. my guess is you are either entering menopause which is not a linear process for most of us. we stop our periods they come again and get off and on until finally they don't return. or your body is reacting to the medication changes. our bodies are more sensitive than we realize. when we moved and i was about 40 my body stopped having periods for nearly 7 months. then they suddenly resumed and never missed one since. now i'm 52 and i'm still having my periods regularly. if i were you i'd let myself wonder about pregnancy. but i'd think it's probably the third most likely possibility. (and an ectopic pregnancy will be looked at quickly. ) still missing that many months of your period if you are not having mood swings or hot flashes would get me to call my doctor just to check things out. good luck!"

the risk factors for developing cholesterol gallstones include: gender. gallstones form more commonly in women than men. age. gallstone prevalence increases with age. obesity. obese people are more likely to form gallstones than thin individuals. pregnancy. women who have been pregnant are more likely to form gallstones than women who have not been pregnant. pregnancy increases the risk for cholesterol gallstones because during pregnancy bile contains more cholesterol and the gallbladder does not contract normally. birth control pills and hormone therapy the increased levels of hormones caused by either treatment mimics pregnancy. rapid weight loss. rapid weight loss by whatever means very low calorie diets or obesity surgery causes cholesterol gallstones in up to 50% of individuals. many of the gallstones will disappear after the weight is lost but many do not. moreover until they are gone they may cause problems. crohn's disease. individuals with crohn's disease of the terminal ileum are more likely to develop gallstones. gallstones form because patients with crohn's disease lack enough bile acids to solubilize the cholesterol in bile. normally bile acids that enter the small intestine from the liver and gallbladder are absorbed back into the body in the terminal ileum and are secreted again by the liver into bile. in other words the bile acids recycle. in crohn's disease the terminal ileum is diseased. bile acids are not absorbed normally the body becomes depleted of bile acids and less bile acids are secreted in bile. there are not enough bile acids to keep cholesterol dissolved in bile and gallstones form. increased blood triglycerides. gallstones occur more frequently in people with elevated blood triglyceride levels. risk for pigment gallstones black pigment gallstones form whenever there is an increased load of bilirubin that reaches the liver. this occurs whenever there is increased destruction of red blood cells as there is in sickle cell disease and thalassemia. black pigment gallstones also are more common among patients with cirrhosis of the liver. brown pigment gallstones form when there is stasis of bile (decreased flow) for example when there are narrow obstructed bile ducts.
yes but he is going to end up getting a mouthful or eye-full of breast milk. if he is okay with that there is no harm. remember that the more your breasts are stimulated (breast feeding or sex play) the more milk you will produce. the more you produce the more engorged (and perhaps uncomfortable) your breasts may become. my wife breastfed our kids and i love the taste of breast milk. she wanted enough milk for the baby so i was limited to the amount i could drink. after about 3 weeks her breasts were getting more and more engorged with milk. she went from a d-cup to a ddd-cup and then to a g-cup. that is when she told me i could have all the breast milk i wanted. our son is 2 years old now and we are still breastfeeding.

first-degree burns are red and painful. they swell a little and turn white when you press on them. the skin over the burn may peel off in a day or two. these are the least severe type of burn affecting only the outer layer of skin. second-degree burns have blisters and are painful. they affect both the outer and thicker middle layer of skin. third-degree burns cause damage to all layers of the skin. the burned skin looks white or charred. these burns may cause little or no pain if nerves are damaged.

you need to get to the er now. with your medical history it is not that important when you started bleeding but rather how much you are bleeding right now. a rapid bleed in the stomach could cause black stools relatively fast. because you are weak and out of breath it would not be wise to delay an immediate medical evaluation.

i have had symptoms of poison ivy rash which was initially on undersides of arms and on front of shins. now over most of my body. after two 5 day treatments of 12 steroids a day and steroid cream it is worse than ever (during steroid treatments it started to fade but came back with a vengence when the pills stopped). desperate now with itching awful looking skin. have left the gym (which had helped me lose 2 stone in 4 months). hate going as whether you are working out or swimming people quite naturally look at your skin. i am now to see a dermatologist on tuesday so can only hope something can be improved. best cooling lotions i have used for relief of itching have been aloe vera and (one i got in the us) called caladryl clear (topical analgesic skin protectant). coated in this after cold water or ice to skin seems to make me more comfortable. i got this in june and it is now nearly september. worst thing i have ever managed to get. deeply regret doing all that gardening now and still haven't found the pouson ivy.

actually tegretol is perfect and definitely it takes time to show results well but you need to be having a better even slow progression with convulsions. if the convulsions are getting worse or not responding completely to that treatment then a modification is going to be needed. concerning the speech a speech therapist should be consulted and he can arrange speech therapy sessions for helping her through it. i recommend a hearing test mri of brain.

com most metals used in surgery are titanium which is used because it causes the least amount of allergic reactions per 100 000 patients but it is still possible to be allergic to it. also many pins clips and sutures labeled and marketed as titanium actually have small impurities metals such as nickel which are more likely to cause allergic reaction.
yes. you can virtually get pregnant anytime that you are ovulating and have unprotected sex.
you have most likely genetically inherited your acne. however your breakouts may get worse when you eat more of certain foods. many studies have been conducted concerning the connection between diet and acne. and so far the most conclusive evidence is that a high glycemic index diet (a diet high in refined sugars) can worsen acne breakouts. some data also suggest that dairy foods can worsen acne due to presence of certain androgenic hormones in cow's milk. if you notice a link between when you consume dairy and the severity of your acne you may benefit from eating dairy substitutes and products that don't contain casein or whey.
the incubation period for chicken pox virus (herpes) is about 2 weeks or so. causal exposure to someone with shingles in a child who has been immunized (i don't know your child's age or if your child had one or two vaccines) is not likely to lead to a disease outbreak. discuss it with her doctor anyway.
i'm sorry you experienced this. it sounds scary! the good news is people usually don't just drop dead suddenly in the manner you describe. i wonder if you mean you felt light-headed when you got out of bed. this is not uncommon. it can be caused by a blood pressure change from lying down to standing. if you continue to have episodes like this please see a health care provider. a physical examination will help discover the cause of the problem. it also will give you peace of mind. take care!
check with your doctor maybe you have muscle soreness however try and do some stretches and take some rest

"most helpful answer what kind of ""stuff""? unfortunately i do not have enough information about this incident to determine if your pain on urination will resolve spontaneously but my guess (and it is a guess) is that the burning will subside in a day or so. if not you will need to see a medical provider for a proper examination and a urinalysis to see if you have an infection. right now you may just have traumatic urethritis so hang in there. keep everything out of your urethra. and hope that it resolves."
take caution when opening the wrapper to avoid tearing the condom with your teeth fingernails or rings. gently pinch the air out of the tip of the condom before putting it on. the condom is rolled over the erect penis before sexual activity begins. if the condom does not have a built-in nipple leave about 1/2-inch of the condom free at the tip of the penis so that semen has a place to collect. a new condom must be used each time you have sex. the condom must be in place before the penis gets near the vagina. if you use lubricants with a condom be sure to only use water-based lubricants such as k-y jelly. oil-based lubricants such as vaseline massage oils and body lotions can cause condoms to leak or break. certain vaginal medications used to treat yeast infections can also weaken condoms. initially it was felt that condoms lubricated with spermicidal agents offered more protection against stds. newer studies show that frequent use of condoms containing spermicides offers no additional protection and it may actually increase the risk of hiv and other stds by irritating the vagina and penis. spermicidal products do however remain useful in pregnancy prevention.
although it may not have the fame of herpes or the clap hpv is actually the most common sexually transmitted disease. fifty percent of all men will have it at some point in their lives. in most cases hpv causes no symptoms and doesnt lead to any health problems. but some strains do cause genital warts. the only way to prevent transmission of the virus is to avoid skin contact. condoms may help reduce transmission but thats not really clear. the virus has no cure. if you do get genital warts theyre most likely to appear on the head of your penis. they can also show up elsewhere including your anus. while they may fade on their own they can also be treated with creams or surgery. hpv does raise the risk of getting cancers of the anus and penis  however those risks are still extremely low.
many people are turning to cow's milk alternatives for the taste and to address lactose intolerance. almond milk does not naturally contain much calcium so most manufacturers fortify the beverage with this mineral. you'll need to check the label to see how much calcium is contained in one serving (usually an 8-oz glass). if you're aiming for 1500mg of calcium per day simply divide that number by the amount of calcium in your chosen product to get the number of glasses you'd need to drink. for example if each serving of your brand of almond milk contains 450mg of calcium then 1500 divided by 450 = 3. 33 glasses daily. hope this helps! just a suggestion. why not try getting calcium in from other sources as well? for instance kale contains calcium. 
when children older than age 6 or teens have bipolar disorder they have mood swings with extreme ups and downs. when they are up they have brief intense outbursts or feel irritable or extremely happy ( mania ) several times almost every day. they have a lot of energy and a high activity level. when they are down they feel depressed and sad. in the past experts thought bipolar disorder was the same in children and adults. but symptoms in children and teens are different from those in adults and they need different treatment. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

it makes a lot of sense. it's another non drowsy medication that works to reduce the allergic response over the long term and the 5 milligram chewable is the children's dose. though it's also used to control asthma it is very useful for allergies. here's more information: 
your partner can only become affected when the affected person has an outbreak! if you have herpes and your partner doesn't you should use protection! also your partner should get tested!
insurance companies may cover certain types of genetic testing but there seems to be no consistency in how or which tests are covered. the only way to know is to contact your health plan directly to find out. to answer your question; yes it does work but they are limited by the amount genes that have been sequenced and workd on so far. negative aspects are yet to be fully understood but as far as health goes the advantages are pretty fantastic. the ramifications of having a health provider screen you based on your genetic disposition is a scary thought for a lot of folks. it's use is increasing especially in the light of president obama's recent speech including it; the president called pharmcogenetics precision medicine ( video link) and called for a huge amount of money to be dedicated towards development and research in this field. it's use is surely going to expand. it makes sense saves time money and whole lot of effort. you can call your insurance company and find out if it's something they will cover but it's relatively new. this subject is something that i personally find fascinating and i found a lot of good information about pharmaco genetic testing. it's only going to be growing and i kinda get excited thinking about how many people this new technology is going to help. i myself have struggled to find the right meds for me but with genetic screening and testing i don't have to worry about that as much. bottom line-it's something you should research some more but it could be very worth it. hope that helped. jim
"in my personal experience ""yes"". i tapered down dosage from twice to once a day for two weeks. then only once a day every other day for two weeks. finally once a day every three days for one week. because i have to go off and back on the medication every six months this is the only way that prevents that ""tingly"" sensation if i just stop completely."
in the united states the flu season usually occurs from about november until april. officials have decided each new flu season will start on oct. 4. typically activity is very low until december and peak activity most often occurs between january and march. ideally the conventional flu vaccine should be administered between september and mid-november. it takes about one to two weeks after vaccination for antibodies against influenza to develop and provide protection. the cdc has published a summary list of their current recommendations of who should get the 2010-2011 vaccine: summary of influenza vaccination recommendations 2010 all people 6 months and older should be vaccinated annually. protection of people at higher risk for influenza-related complications should continue to be a focus of vaccination efforts as providers and programs transition to routine vaccination of all people 6 months and older. when vaccine supply is limited vaccination efforts should focus on delivering vaccination to people who are 6 months to 4 years (59 months) of age are 50 years of age and older have chronic pulmonary (including asthma) cardiovascular (except hypertension) renal hepatic neurologic hematologic or metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus) are immunosuppressed (including immunosuppression caused by medications or by human immunodeficiency virus) are or will be pregnant during the influenza season are 6 months to 18 years of age and receiving long-term aspirin therapy and who therefore might be at risk for experiencing reye's syndrome after influenza virus infection are residents of nursing homes and other chronic-care facilities are american indians/alaska natives are morbidly obese (body mass index is 40 or greater) are health-care personnel are household contacts and caregivers of children aged younger than 5 years and adults aged 50 years and older with particular emphasis on vaccinating contacts of children aged younger than 6 months; and are household contacts and caregivers of people with medical conditions that put them at higher risk for severe complications from influenza as each flu season progresses and as the cdc refines its data from previous flu seasons and pandemics this summary may be modified. the cdc publishes routine updates about the flu at flu. gov and at .
that's a very interesting question. i'm glad you asked. in the medical community we often tend not to treat a condition that's asymptomatic (doesn't have symptoms). as long as you're sure your low testosterone levels aren't related to another condition such as obesity or diabetes i think the choice of whether or not to treat it is up to you. it's a discussion you should have with your health care provider. he or she can contribute their expert medical knowledge and you can take into account your personal values and feelings. between the two of you you can arrive at a decision that's right for you. remember too you can always change your mind. if you choose not to treat your low testosterone now but experience symptoms in the future you can always opt for testosterone replacement therapy. likewise if you decide to treat your low testosterone now you can always choose to discontinue treatment later. take care!

treatment of molluscum-associated eczema is directed toward the underlying dry skin. general measures to prevent excessive skin dryness and breakdown (such as mild soapless cleansers) are recommended. lubrication with moisturizer lotions (such as cetaphil or lubriderm) is helpful for many people. eczema that is more resistant may require the addition of an over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream (such as cortaid or a prescription medium potency topical steroid cream such as triamcinolone once or twice a day) for inflamed or itchy areas. topical steroids should not be applied directly to the molluscum bumps as they may worsen molluscum contagiosum.

not a clue. i have never read that cats have the ability to smell poison ivy. as far as cats are concerned no one has yet to unravel specific reasons for their unusual behaviors.
the cause(s) of psoriasis is really unknown. i can vindicate the cats as a cause however. cats can cause allergic responses to the skin but cats do not cause psoriasis.
there is really no such lab test as a liver count. there are specific liver tests like the alt ast etc. that all have their individula lab normal ranges. please review your test results again or specific ask which of these liver enzyme tests have a value of 219

hi this is from the uk's nhs sounds just like your symptoms? white or grey fishy-smelling discharge if your vaginal discharge is grey or develops a strong fishy smell particularly after sexual intercourse you could have bacterial vaginosis (bv). bv is an imbalance in the normal bacteria found in your vagina. it does not usually cause itching or irritation. like thrush bv is very common and is not sexually transmitted. it is easily treated with antibiotics. see your gp for a prescription. now you can either go the antibiotic way or if your one of these people who's against. antibiotics because there to much use of them ok there is lots of natural ways you can try now just google each one for bv. like garlic for bv boric acid for bv sea salt for bv or look through these links one at a time.    just google each at one at a time copy to the www. to open and read. do hope this helps you. good luck

my husband had shingles and both my daughters got chicken pox. the incubation period is 14 to 21 days from the time they first are exposed. he had them on his chest and they did not come in contact with that part of him but they got them anyway. i think exposure is more than touching the scabs evidently. but the old saying that if you get them once you won't get them again is only true with chicken pox. if a person is susceptible and exposed and their resistance is low they will get shingles if exposed to them or if their body won't fight it off. some people opt for a shot that i'm not sure of the name of it but if a person gets it within a certain amount of time after the recover from the shingles they are less likely to get them again. but they say it is quite expensive. so just being in the same house and touching things the person with shingles has touched will cause a child to contact the chicken pox as it is of the same virus.
this is a serious response. medical professionals do not provide potents that make people ugly for a day or at least not since the dark ages so you may need to see a theatrical make-up artist.
hi i found you this its an answer on csn cancer. org psa levels vary with each man. what is normal for one may be a little high for another yet how high is it as compared to previous psa levels? i assume there were none.? doctors look for a radical or rapid change in the trend of psa tests. if this is the first test for your brother it may not be a problem but should be monitered closely. prostate cancer is supposedly slow growing yet he does not want to wait or do nothing! once it spreads out of the prostate the treatments and options are worse. in my case i am 57 (58 this month) and was running above 2. 0 and creeping up a minute amount every six months then it jumped 4+ points (7. 62)in approx 60-90 days. we treated it with antibotics for a month to determine if it was merely a bladder or urinary infection. at the end of the month it was unchanged. we then did the biopsy and determined prostate cancer. (two opinions) my case was such that i had the option of choosing the type of treatment after much research. not everyone i understand is suitable for some treatments due to various factors. meanwhile i went on hormone therapy. it supposedly eliminates the food this cancer grows on (testortrone) shrinks the prostate and is believed to make the cancer cell more vulnerable to future radiation treatment if that is the choice. i chose radiated seed implant - there are other courses of treatment available - the one that is best for your brother if he has cancer are between his doctors and himself mainly not what we others chose. if your brother would like to discuss the various options there are many contributors tauting their success and methods of treatment and all of us are more than willing to discuss any questions / concerns or things we experienced. don't panic. there is a lot of data available. research it on the internet and through the amer. cancer site. they too are able willing and responsive to any questions. all we survivors can impart is what we experienced. do hope this is helping you but if you do get tested and things don't look bad and its just enlarged do have a read up about tuna if you have this done it shrinks it down i do know of somebody who had this done perked up his sex life so his wife is now very happy about that but do hope this helps you. good luck

how wonderful that you keep close tabs on your dad while he's in assisted living. it's great he has someone to help advocate for his health needs. it wouldn't hurt to get your dad's dizziness symptoms checked out by a health care provider. it's one of those things that could be related to his breakfast meal (such as perhaps low blood sugar) or it could be coincidental. for instance dehydration can also cause the type of symptoms you describe and dehydration is very common in elderly people. you might encourage your dad to drink plenty of water. the main thing is this: since the symptoms are bothering him and no one wants to see him fall and break a bone or gash his head it's probably a good idea to have a health care provider evaluate this. all the best to you and your dad!
controlling seizures caused by epilepsy requires a daily commitment to following your treatment plan. if you are using antiepileptic medicine you must take your medicine exactly as prescribed. not following the treatment plan is one of the main reasons why medicines fail to control seizures. antiepileptic medicines will work only if the right medicine level is maintained in your body. your doctor will set up a schedule of medicine dosages that keeps the proper medicine levels in your body. missing one or more doses can throw the whole system off. see information on: epilepsy: taking your medicines properly. the same rule about following your treatment plan applies if you or your child is on a special ketogenic diet. the ketogenic diet can be hard to follow but it must be followed exactly. as you follow your treatment plan also try to identify and avoid things that may make you more likely to have a seizure such as: not getting enough sleep. using drugs or alcohol. being emotionally stressed. skipping meals. if you continue to have seizures despite treatment keep a record of any seizures you have. note the date time of day and any details about the seizure that you can remember. your doctor can use information about your seizures to plan or adjust your medicine or other treatment. if you have not been diagnosed with epilepsy a record of your seizures can help your doctor figure out whether you might have epilepsy and what kinds of seizures you are having. if your child or someone else in your family has epilepsy learn what to do when someone has a seizure. if you have epilepsy (or your child has epilepsy): be sure that any doctor treating you for any condition knows that you have epilepsy and knows what medicines you are taking if any. wear a medical identification bracelet (such as medicalert). in the event of a seizure or accident that leaves you unconscious or unable to speak for yourself a medical id bracelet will let those who are treating you know that you have epilepsy. it will also list any medicines you are taking to control your seizures so that you are not given any medicines that will react badly with those already in your body. if you have a child with epilepsy there are other tips for parents that may be helpful. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

"if you have shingles it's important to talk to your doctor about your risk for developing phn (postherpetic neuralgia). ask whether preventative treatment with antiviral drugs makes sense. if your doctor says it's not necessary ask why. the full implications of the psychological risk factors for phn aren't clear yet says robert h. dworkin phd a professor in the department of anesthesiology at the university of rochester medical center in rochester n. y. but he suggests that people with shingles should try to stay active and connected. ""if psychological distress is a risk factor for phn "" he says ""then we think that people who have shingles might benefit from getting out and not being isolated and homebound. "" you might make an effort to stay connected to family and friends and not to dwell on your symptoms. also keep in mind that even if you do develop phn there are treatments that can help. ""we have about a half dozen types of drugs that are used as first-line treatments for phn "" says dworkin. they include lidoderm lyrica neurontin tegretol zostrix cream tricyclic antidepressants and painkillers. ""there are many options now and some of them have only become available in the last few years "" he says. the most important thing is to get prompt medical attention if you think you might have shingles. ""if you have a one-sided rash  especially if you're over 50  see your doctor right away "" says dworkin. ""it could be shingles. and we know that prompt treatment can dramatically reduce the likelihood of developing long-term pain. """
hi these symptoms can be due to long standing bronchitis or early stages of asthma. you should get spirometry ct chest and if necessary a bronchoscopy done to see whats wrong. breathing exercises in fresh air will help. avoid doing strenous work outs. consult a physician. thanks
see a medical provider so you can be properly examined and perhaps tested for strep. there are numerous non-strep reasons for a sore throat like viruses or environmental reasons (like the dryness you mentioned) but causes cannot be blindly determined based solely on a posted description of the problem. because of nerve pathways one can get ear pain from a problem in the throat. or a person can have more than one medical problem at the same time (a sore throat and an ear infection).

its due to poor hygiene wash vaginal area thoroughly after you go to the bathroom. local vaginal pessaries will help. public toilet using wont cause it. very rare
in my opinion the motorized toothbrushes really do help in plaque removal. i also love the water piks with diluted mouthwashes in them. however if cost is a factor a regular soft toothbrush and mouthwash will work.
changes in your breasts are another very early sign of pregnancy. when you conceive your body undergoes a rapid change in hormone levels. because of the changes in hormones you may notice in one to two weeks that your breasts have become swollen sore or tingly. or they may feel heavier or fuller or feel tender to the touch. in addition the area around the nipples called the areola may darken. pregnancy is not the only thing that can cause breast changes. a hormonal imbalance that's unrelated to pregnancy could be responsible. the changes could also be caused by a change in birth control pills or they could be a premenstrual symptom. if the changes are an early symptom of pregnancy keep in mind that it is going to take your body several weeks to get used to the new levels of hormones. but when it does your breasts will feel less painful than they do in the beginning.
hi yes this rash can be due to sjorgens syndrome and is quite common to happen. like your earlier rash even this will go away in a few days. if it doesnt then you can consult a skin specialist to rule out other causes. thanks.
the symptom severity (ss) scale measures three key symptoms during the past week:
2 weeks after surgery and having such symptoms should be investigated well do cbc is the operated part is inflammed or something do u see any strange vaginal discharge?
your not moving enough stool it is building up & causing the problems. you will find otc meds will not work that well you need to find foods that will allow you to go on a regular basis. i had this very problem & found cherrio's or other wheat based products help move things along even if it's just wheat toast.
it's certainly possible. you can reduce the risk to your partner by having sex only when you have no symptoms of genital herpes. however the virus can still be contagious without any noticeable symptoms such as sores or a rash on the skin. that's why you should always use a latex condom. a condom does not completely eliminate the risk because it may not cover an affected area but it does offer some protection. taking antiviral medications acyclovir (zovirax) valtrex and famvir can make symptoms appear less often and make them less severe. there is some evidence that these drugs also may protect against transmission.
they usually prescribe compression stockings for such a condition.
it's always a bit unsettling to see blood in the urine  or anywhere it's not supposed to be! a small amount of blood in the urine is not uncommon when you have a urinary tract infection (uti). have you been diagnosed with a uti by your health care provider? if not you should not assume blood (even just a pinkish tinge) in the urine is enough to diagnose a uti. blood in the urine can be a symptom of other conditions and definitely needs to be evaluated by a health care professional. a urinary tract infection requires treatment with antibiotics. so if you think you have a uti you should make an appointment to see your primary care provider. by the way the jury is still out on the value of cranberry in treating or preventing utis. the most recent study on this topic showed that cranberry has virtually no value in treating or preventing urinary tract infections. i mention this so that you don't delay getting professional treatment in order to try cranberry juice or supplements. best wishes to you!

"spontaneous osteoarthritis is to a major degree a result of inherited tendencies. we inherit the tendency to develop osteoarthritis from our parents and their parents etc. therefore prevention is not technically possible. obesity has long been known to be a risk factor for osteoarthritis of the knee. however by maintaining optimal weight we can minimize the risk of developing and worsening osteoarthritis of the knees. we can also ""prevent"" osteoarthritis by minimizing the risks for injury of joints. for example avoiding high risk sports after certain ages etc."
"oral benadryl is safe for younger children but i do not know the exact age when you say ""under two years old"" (a newborn is under two years old! ). there are other prescription medications that are often used for eczema in younger children to control the itching so before given benadryl it is best to check with his pediatrician first  someone who knows your child the severity of his eczema and of course his age/weight. control itching is extremely important for eczema patients."
zyrtec-d is available as a 12-hour formulation and should relieve your allergy symptoms and congestion for 12 hours.
the risk of pregnancy in using routine antibiotics and birth control pills (bcps) is very low. in fact antifungals (e. g. ketoconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e. g. erythromycin azythromycin biaxin) actually increased blood levels of estradiolnot decrease them. being late taking some bcps can also increase [the] risk of pregnancy but the risk is not large unless you entirely miss for two to three days. unprotected sex on active pills does not increase risk unless you had just completely missed several days of active pills. . i would urge you to do a reliable pregnancy test. for the most accurate answer you can do one test on the first day of your next pack. .
hi. there seem to be a similar substance that may have still remained inside your uterus causing incomplete discharge of the substance. it may be blood clots mixed with endometrial substance. u should get a usg abdomen done to see the remnants in the uterus. take anti spasmodics for the pain till then consult a gynecologist if the symptoms are severe. thanks
"once you and your clinician have decided that it's time to stop what's the best approach? the simple answer is that we don't know. formal studies to evaluate this question have failed to show that either going cold turkey or tapering off is better. so the choice is really yours. the important thing is to know that women in general have about a 50/50 chance of experiencing hot flashes again (although maybe not as severe as initially) after stopping. some studies suggest that symptoms peak within 3 months after stopping hormones. after you stop take some time to evaluate how you feel before beginning any new medication so you don't get the two effects confused. there are a couple of other things to keep an eye on once you've stopped ht. if you develop vaginal dryness or recurrent urinary tract infections ask your clinician about vaginal estrogens. nonhormonal lubricants and moisturizers can also help with dryness. and you might want to ask about a bone density test. we know that women who stop ht often lose bone. depending on your bone density score and risk profile you might be a candidate for an osteoporosis drug (bone-sparing). at any rate discuss calcium and vitamin d supplements weight-bearing exercise and fall prevention with your clinician. another good idea is to have your cholesterol rechecked in about 3 months after stopping ht because hormones can affect ""lipid levels"" (both good and bad). and if you're taking a thyroid medication for an underactive thyroid your dose might need to be adjusted. thanks for your reply!"

"unless a star rose in the east your little cousin is not telling the whole truth. if that ""messing around"" included any penetration or ejaculation it was certainly sufficient to cause of a pregnancy. unless she inserted a turkey basting device filled with sperm or secretly had in vitro she is lying or certainly in serious denial. ask her how else sperm may have made it into her vagina up her fallopian tubes and greeted a waiting egg? sperm does not walk across the carpet swim up a leg circumvent the underwear and seek out an egg all by itself. let her tell her story. you know it is a bunch of baloney but now that she has a baby it would be better to focus on this new little life than that little lie. there could be some truth to it. here is an article on teen sex & pregnancy myths that explain about pre-ejaculate. i hope this helps. the webmd answers staff i be leave you can i no because i have them and my do true told my mom i was"
hi. 520 sugar is too much. and should be brought down immediately. if possible admit her to a hospital and get her levels to as low as possible by insulin drips. atleast 250-300 should be achieved. later on she can take tablets to reduce the remaining sugar levels. but if she is not diabetic then you need to find out the reason for such high sugar level raise. thanks
yes you can take them together. flonase is a steroid nasal spray and allegra is an antihistamine.
there are plenty of other effective antibiotics like erythromycin or the cephalosporins (some penicillin allergic people may have a cross-over allergy to this class however). he needs to be under the care of a good dentist now. let the dentist determine the type of treatment and antibiotics. if he has an abscess he needs more than just a prescription for a non-penicillin based antibiotic. dental infections like you are describing need immediate and definitive care.
no i have never heard of iron pills enlarging a woman's uterus. there are many medical conditions than can cause enlargement however so it would be in her best interest to see a gynecologist for a thorough examination.
i highly doubt that you are pregnant. stress and worry can cause irregular periods. also pre-cum doesn't always carry sperm especially if you partner has urinated since he ejaculated last. you might have had implantation bleeding if you had been pregnant but you certainly wouldn't have had a second period. regarding the peeing four times frequent urination doesn't usually start until the fetus is quite large like the third trimester or so. nausea could come from feeling nervous or a garden variety cold or flu bug.
most probably these are because of corticosteroids however not the matter of concern.

i used to play football and suffered from this as well. i personally put a little bit of vaseline on my chin and forehead before putting on my helmet. it helped. also if that doesnt work try putting a fungicide on your chin guard and the inside of your helmet. it could be a form of jock itch. you get sweaty in those helmets and they can be a breeding ground for all sorts of things. hope this helps.
i am not an md but i asked my doctor the same exact question a few years ago. he said herpes is a blood-borne virus that can be transferred at any time and the only sure way to avoid contracting it is to avoid sexual intercourse with someone who is infected.
it's important to use an eye makeup remover that's specific for waterproof mascara. i am not a big fan of waterproof mascara for that very reason. i think it does coat the eyelashes a little too heavily and can be difficult to remove and sometimes the eyelashes can come out with it. fortunately the eyelash cycle is pretty quick so your hair will grow back very quickly over time really within a matter of a few weeks. but it's uncomfortable if you are using it over a long period of time to keep losing lashes like that. so i would try recommending a water-based mascara except for very special occasions when you really need something longer lasting. then if you have the waterproof mascara look for something that's very specific and take your time. let it sit on your lashes for a little bit longer and then rinse with lukewarm water and then repeat the process without rubbing because it's the rubbing that can physically remove the lashes.
i understand your concern. actually there is no treatment or medicine to prevent ectopic pregnancy. only thing to look for is to avoid using copper-t for contraception as this may increase the chance of ectopic pregnancy in case you conceive. take care to get an early ultrasound as soon as you discover pregnancy next time. also there is high chance of around 10%-15% to get your next pregnancy too as ectopic. no process or medicine is available presently to prevent this condition. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online

"remember that the ""protection"" is not just for pregnancy; it is for the prevention of a sexually-transmitted disease. unless you are 100% sure (no 200%) sure of the absolute fidelity of your partner under every concieveable circumstance now and in the past it is best to keep condoms in your routine."
to soon to tell. wait a week before your period is due and take a test.

be sure to get in touch with your doctor about your leg pain and thyroid  only a healthcare provider can address your medical needs. once you get that worked out you can focus on gaining muscle. make sure you get protein at every meal along with a balanced diet adequate in calories. research shows 25 grams or more of protein at meals helps build muscle. to give you an idea 1 ounce of lean meat has 7 grams. also exercise that includes resistance training is beneficial as long as it's okay with your doctor. after working out consume a snack that contains protein and carbohydrates within a half hour of stopping exercise. more reading. healthy protein sources what to eat before during and after exercise

"let him do it. sometimes bad experiences help. the answer is no. if you try and ""burn a nerve"" there is a very good chance that the pain will be worse. i have neuropathy and my doctor wanted to do this but stated that it is a 50/50 chance that it would work. my wife is a nurse and she asked about this with doctors she assists at the hospital and they stated the same and also the pain usually returns."
hi been off and found this. how does it effect blood pressure? viagra can slightly lower blood pressure. this is not a problem for most men. but viagra's effect on blood pressure is exaggerated if the viagra is taken with a nitrate drug. nitrates are one of the treatments doctors prescribe for angina. if you take viagra when you are also taking nitrates the combined effect of the viagra and the nitrates can lower your blood pressure to such an extent that it could prove fatal. never take viagra at the same time as taking nitrates. if i have a heart condition can i take it? if you have a heart condition it is important that you discuss this with the doctor before taking viagra. viagra may not be appropriate because of the danger of interacting with the nitrates. but i think your find if your low blood pressure is a naturally occurring thing then taken viagra would not do you any damage unless you was pushing the doses. but have you tried take l-arginine 1000mg and zinc to improve your erections. see if this helps you. good luck

"antipsychotic medications are used as a short-term treatment for bipolar disorder to control psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, or mania symptoms. these symptoms may occur during acute mania or severe depression. some also treat bipolar depression, and several have demonstrated long-term value in preventing future episodes of mania or depression."
actually both foods can contribute to heartburn and may actually make it worse. when treating heartburn we always recommend non-pharmacological methods like avoiding spicy and fatty foods stop smoking and avoid eating at least three hours before bedtime.
"i'm sorry you're going through this. certainly a lumbar puncture is nobody's idea of a good time! ""white matter brain disease"" is not a single diagnosis. actually there are several diseases that affect the white matter of the brain. i suspect your neurologist is trying to determine if you have one of those diseases or not. i'd suggest you discuss your concerns about the lumbar draw with your neurologist. ask him why he feels it's necessary and what he is trying to learn from it. ask him if there are other non-invasive tests that could be done instead. don't be afraid to express your fears or concerns with him or her. you are the patient and you deserve to have all your questions answered. i wish you all the best with this!"

do i need a specialist for a biopsy?
it has been in the news lately and the reason why is because children were getting multiple different types of medications not intentionally and were exactly following the directions. the parents were kind of like well i need to go to work and i need to get my child to school. so they're giving them all these different types of medicines not realizing that some of them contain the same ingredients. children were becoming very tired they were having different types of reactions and actually some children did end up in the emergency room. the labeling and directions have actually been revised and now most products are not recommended for use in children under four. so as a parent when you come into the pharmacy ask the pharmacist if they can assist you in making sure you're choosing the right product. the pharmacist is going to ask you a lot of questions including what is your child's weight? we are finding out more and more that these medications need to be dosed on the child's weight rather than their age. also when you get a dropper or spoon that comes with the medication you want to keep those together. that spoon was specifically designed for that medication to make sure your child receives the right dose. read the labels. the labels may have tylenol cough and cold but it is going to contain some products other than just tylenol. then you might go to a robitussin type of product which may contain the same thing as well. make sure everyone in the house is aware of what you might be giving your child to help their cough or cold. sometimes we have nannies or grandparents that come over and say oh i'm going to give him some medication. well make sure everyone knows when the last time the medication was given what was given and keep track of it. sometimes also the best medication is no medication at all. we might want it to run its course or it may just require something like a simple nasal drop or running a vaporizer at night. it's as simple as that. but we really want to keep this in mind we want to be safe we want to make sure that parents understand that. there are lot of questions around this topic. ask your pharmacist or the medication experts we'll be more than happy to help you with this.
hi. blurry vision and the spots may be due to temporary remnants of the infectiona nd the use of eye drops. these usually fade away in about 1 month time. only if the blurry vision deteriorates and vision gets affected badly or if the spots increase then she may need some active management. else presently she just needs lubricating eye drops and also give her oral multivitamin medicines to speed up the recovery. thanks
as you may have read on the label dimetapp is not to be used in children under age six. thus you should not give it to your child unless your pediatrician tells you it's ok. you may also wish to ask your pharmacist about this. i can think of several situations in which it could be all right to give dimetapp to a five-year-old but i cannot go into them on this public forum. for one thing i know nothing about your child and his/her medical history. your pharmacist however can give you accurate information about whether or not an over-the-counter cough and cold remedy would be appropriate for your child. wishing you well!
hi this is a failed back syndrome. happens in 30 % post operative cases. take physiotherapy in form of traction laser therapy. get another mri done thanks
it is probably best to keep your cobra in place but at the same time it is absolutely a good idea to look at your state marketplace check out coverage options available online and see whether there is a more affordable option that covers the doctors he sees. if he has no income you may also want to see whether he qualifies for medicaid coverage in your state. that may also be an option that is more affordable than cobra.

"it's always nerve-wracking to think about going under anesthesia isn't it? you're wise to think about how your medication might affect the experience. let me set your mind at ease by saying in general your anesthesiologist should not have difficulty providing general anesthesia even though you take adderall. of course ""going under"" always has some risks. however by telling the anesthesia provider what medications you take you're helping him or her make the experience as safe as possible. a few days before your surgery you should have an appointment or phone call with a nurse who will give you instructions regarding what medications to take or stop taking before your surgery. be sure to tell her or him about all the medications you take regularly including vitamins and other supplements. if you don't receive any instructions at least a day or two before your surgery call your surgeon's office. on the day of surgery your anesthesiology provider will meet with you. be sure you again tell him or her about all the medications you take. this will help your anesthesiologist to give you the best care possible. good luck with your surgery!"

cdc does not recommend one flu vaccine over another. this includes deciding between trivalent or quadrivalent vaccine or between injection (the flu shot) or nasal spray vaccine. the important thing is to get a flu vaccine every year! getting you flu vaccine regardless of which option you choose can be instrumental in protecting you and your loved ones from flu.
this is a great question. when patients come in or consumers and ask me about heartburn as a pharmacist i have to ask them a few questions to find out what kind of heartburn are they having. for instance if they are having heartburn at night they really need to see a physician. i need to find out how frequently they are having their heartburn. if they are having it everyday or is it only one or two times a week? then i need to ask them some questions about their diet because what they may not understand is that diet caffeine acidic foods even smoking could lead to heartburn. then i will look at them and say okay are they taking any other medications? my elderly patients hopefully they have their medication list with them. i will be able to take a look and see what's appropriate for them. there are a variety of different products that are available. if it's just something for quick relief then you could use like an antacid like a maalox or a tums something along those lines. if it's something that maybe needs a little bit more consistency then we can go more towards a pepcid type of product which works a little differently by cutting down on the amount of acid in the stomach. if they complain that they have had it more frequently during the day for a number of days then the choice might be something like prilosec otc which they are going to take for about 14 days. if they come back to the pharmacy after that and the 14 days and it hasn't worked then i am going refer them back to their physician or their healthcare provider for further evaluation.
they can but it isn't as likely that they will. lice like to live in clean oil free hair. since african american's usually have more oil in their hair it isn't as inviting of an environment for the lice to live in.

"a baker's cyst can indeed be removed by surgery. in fact that's a typical ""last resort"" step after drainage and steroids haven't solved the problem. a baker's cyst is a fluid-filled sac behind the knee joint. that's why all of your pain is behind your knee rather than in your joint proper. as to why your physician is recommending a knee replacement that's a good question. i'd ask him or her. sometimes an underlying condition like arthritis can cause a baker's cyst to develop. if that's the case in your situation it could be one reason why your doctor would mention a knee replacement as opposed to simply removing the cyst. i'm only mentioning this for informational purposes not in an attempt to read your doctor's mind. i'd suggest you go back to your doctor and find out why he or she is recommending a knee replacement. you may want to consult a surgeon as well to get his or her opinion about what the best treatment option is for you. hope this helps!"

medications will work properly when stored in an environment away from light heat and moisture. medications improperly stored can expire before the expiration date. using expired medication is very risky. expired medications are not only less potent but some medications become toxic when used beyond the expiration date. taking expired drugs can cause an unwanted visit to the emergency department as well having an unnecessary medical bill.
if you have kidney damage you should keep your blood pressure below 130/80. the national heart lung and blood institute (nhlbi) one of the national institutes of health (nih) recommends that people with kidney disease use whatever therapy is necessary including lifestyle changes and medicines to keep their blood pressure below 130/80. nhlbi has found that five lifestyle changes can help control blood pressure: maintain your weight at a level close to normal. choose fruits vegetables grains and low-fat dairy foods. limit your daily sodium (salt) intake to 2 000 milligrams or lower if you already have high blood pressure. read nutrition labels on packaged foods to learn how much sodium is in one serving. keep a sodium diary. get plenty of exercise which means at least 30 minutes of moderate activity such as walking most days of the week. avoid consuming too much alcohol. men should limit consumption to two drinks (two 12-ounce servings of beer or two 5-ounce servings of wine or two 1. 5-ounce servings of hard liquor) a day. women should have no more than a single serving on a given day because metabolic differences make women more susceptible to the effects of alcohol. limit caffeine intake.

it is not safe to give your child expired medication  even if it is prescription or over-the-counter. your child may be put at risk for having an allergic reaction to the medication breaking down and the medicine may not even work. it is not worth it especially if it costs you a trip to the hospital. you should go through all of your medications once a year. make sure you get those vitamins and over-the-counters as well. the process is really easy for disposal: we do not recommend flushing anymore; instead get a zip-top bag and place the medicines in the bag. you can then add some water to the bag to help them dissolve. next add kitty litter or coffee grinds zip it up and throw it in the trash.
the 2010 dietary guidelines allow room for discretionary calories to help satisfy your sweet tooth. ten to fifteen percent of calories can be used for sweets and treats as long as you reach your quotas for healthy foods like fruits vegetables low fat dairy lean protein and whole grains. if you need 2 000 calories per day you can enjoy almost 300 discretionary calories. try to satisfy your sweet tooth with foods and beverages that also contain nutrients you need such as: low-fat milk with a teaspoon or two of chocolate strawberry or vanilla syrup low-fat plain yogurt mixed with fruit honey or low-sugar fruit preserves added fresh or dried fruit in cereals whole grain graham crackers or fig bars snack frozen grapes fruit smoothies
there are a number of prescription and nonprescription medications for migraine. products available over-the-counter like excedrin are not a good choice for you as they contain aspirin. some people who have allergic reactions to aspirin may also have an allergy to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) like ibuprofen (brand name: advil or motrin) or naproxen (brand name: aleve). talk with your health care provider to see if he/she wants you to avoid nsaids as well. if so there are prescription medications for migraines called the triptans such as sumatriptan (brand name: imitrex) zolmitriptan (brand name: zomig) or rizatriptan (brand name: maxalt). they work very well at relieving a migraine when it occurs and they should be taken at the first sign of migraine symptoms. you will need to consult with a health care provider to obtain a prescription for one of these products but these should be safe to take if you have an aspirin allergy.
if you qualify for medicaid those are the plans you'll be offered. if you decide instead to buy a different type of plan you'll be required to pay its full cost. consumers don't have the opportunity to choose the tye of financial assistance they accept.
you are correct. dark red or brown urine could be blood although there are medications and even certain foods that can change the color of the urine. this would have nothing to do with your recent hep b vaccine. one common cause of blood in the urine would be a urinary tract infection even if you are not feeling any other symptoms. just the way a nose can suddenly bleed the bladder can do the same. this would be high on my list if you were female. urinary tract infections are uncommon in men. a kidney stone can cause urinary bleeding as well. i would be advisable for you to see your medical provider today and have a urinalysis to see if you are indeed having a urinary tract bleed. if not your medical provider can search for other possibilities. two nights ago had dark red urine?

variations in blood pressure are normal. bp readings should be done by a professional or using a professional bp monitor. however bp usually increases during the day and should be lower at night. 150/100 bp is considered as hypertension and should be treated. you should consult your gp regarding your bp findings.

if you need radiation it would be given every day (except on weekends) for a number of days that is determined by the dose of radiation that your physician feels that you need. typically we do give chemotherapy at the same time. sometimes though not all the time there is more chemotherapy after completion of chemoradiation. .

a couple of weeks ago i ran to the grocery store to grab a few ingredients for a pasta dish i was making. i was reminded â as i was holding the last sad and wimpy two-dollar bunch of fresh basil in my hands â how an herb garden or pot can save you time and money. for about the same amount of cash i was able to buy a big pot of fresh basil and plant it in a big pot in my backyard but this $2. 99 is the gift that keeps on giving. you dont need much to make an herb garden or herb pot happen. you just need two square feet of patio or deck space and most of us have a big pot or two sitting idle in the back of the shed. now we can put this empty pot to work! add some dirt or potting soil then plant your favorite herbs. i planted a gob of basil some parsley and some sage for less than $10. you can start using them in your cooking immediately!
someday manufacturers may have the flavonoid content on their packaging but we aren't quite there yet. basically cocoa powder has the highest amount of phytochemicals followed by bittersweet and then semisweet chocolate. the dark chocolate that has 60% cacao or more on the label is a good sign. you might find out about the specific process used by the chocolate company by checking their website. i personally find dark chocolate very satisfying!
good for you for performing a testicular self-exam. it's critically important to the early detection of cancer. that said i don't want you to immediately assume you have testicular cancer. you do need to get those lumps checked out by a doctor though. i'd suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider as soon as possible. other conditions such as benign (non-cancerous) cysts can cause lumps in the scrotum. your health care provider will be able to diagnose what those lumps are and get you appropriate treatment. wishing you all the best!
some people feel that genes related to addiction can be transmitted to the offspring since alcoholism can run in families. it can be very difficult to say what human characteristics are genetic versus environmental factors. growing up in a family that has more than their share of alcoholism i can certainly say that it never surfaced in me. i actually detest alcohol. alcoholism is classified as a disease and certain characteristics in our personality can be genetically transmitted but to worry that a male alcoholic would create an alcoholic child would be a stretch at this point. an alcoholic. one who continues to drink. would not make a good father/husband for lots of reasons.
any condition is life threatening if not taken care of. my mother 7 years ago died because her bowl burst. if that happens you have an hour to get help. she was 69 and mainly stress and eatting red meat was her vice that and she didnt want to bother anyone. so on it's own no if you had neglect ignore the warning signs it will end in a free trip to a funeral home.
the provider reimbursement rates will vary widely across the country and among health plans so it's impossible to say. however it is reasonable to expect that in order to keep costs down and be competitive in the marketplaces insurers may seek to reduce provider reimbursement rates. however competitiveness will also depend on how robust a provider network plans can offer consumers so there will be a balancing act.
"one common side effect of narcotics can be sexual dysfunction including decreased desire and performance. medications like viagra and cialis may be able to help with performance but usually do not increase desire. for most people if there is decreased desire they may not be ""inspired"" to have sex. i remind patients that are on pain medications like narcotics that it is for quality of life and that if you don't need it at that time you may not have to take it. some people who do this may have improvement if their symptoms."
the thing about clear skin is that it's really not about how clean or dirty your face is. there is a bacteria that can live at the very base of your hair follicle which is your pore that can create what we see as acne. and no matter how much you wash you will not wash that away. i have also seen people use rubbing alcohol on their skin and that has no effect on the type of bacteria that causes acne and will only dry out and irritate your skin. so what you really need to do is to use products that will focus on the underlying problem and not over wash because if you over wash your face what you can do is actually dry out your skin create irritation and inflammation that can look like acne or skin that is breaking out. but if you just stop that your skin would clear up even more.
"a lower than normal body temperature of 96 is just fine; if you are ""room temperature"" it would be time to worry. slightly lower body temperatures is not uncommon in viral infectons; perhaps the cause of your sore throat."
the allergic symptoms usually aggravate during winter season. it continues from november till february based on the climate in your place. you have not mentioned about the allergic site (nose or lung or skin). if it is nose or lung the dryness due to winter can trigger the allergic response in nose. in this situation you need to maintain moisture by just applying a drop of coconut oil in each nostril before going to bed. on the other hand you can apply a drop of anu thailam (an ayurvedic nasal drops for allergy) in each nostril before going to bed. during evenings and nights when it is too cold you need to protect your ears (by keeping cotton plug) nose (by applying oil drops) head (by covering head with a woolen cap) and hands and feet (by wearing gloves and socks). the external cold stimulus triggers the allergic response. so prevent yourself from the cold stimulus to avoid allergy. if you have allergic asthma then it is better to practice pranayama and yoga. breathing exercises will help you. if you have allergic skin disorder then you can use vaseline or vegetable oils to gently apply on the skin. this helps in overcoming the dryness due to the cold climate. the skin manifestation should also be examined by a physician to decide the proper medication. revert back to an ayurveda specialist online for further follow up

this is a very common problem and i see it in men and women and especially in the summertime when our heels tend to show more. so it's important to hydrate your skin. people are great at moisturizing their face but when it gets to their feet they just seem to skip that area. so moisturizing really helps and using a product that is what's called a keratolytic. so your skin is made up of proteins called keratins and lytic means to break that up. so ingredients like urea or lactic acid can help those skin cells become less sticky. and will exfoliate them off a little bit better and then moisturizing really helps. you can soak your feet in a little bit of water and olive oil for about ten minutes and then when your skin is nice and soft and damp you can put an ointment like aquaphor ointment or even just vaseline or even just crisco oil if you like and then put on a sock to help lock that water in and that will help keep your feet soft and smooth.

there is a moderate drug interaction between these two medications. the disabling of the motor coordination and mental alertness is effected with one medication alone. both medications give an additive effect or intensify the side effects. depending on the dose doctors worry about respiratory depression. however if the medications are taken according to the physician's directions there shouldn't be any issues. just be cautious of the cognitive capabilities while on both these medications.

"most helpful answer don't do your own penis surgery. that would be stupid. obviously i can't see what you are talking about but you may have a penile ""bridge"" (you can look this up on the internet). or a remnant from a circumcision. a penile bridge can be cut by a urologist under a local anesthetic but to do it yourself would not be in your best interest. these things are common and are not awkward to discuss with your medical provider. do the right thing and see a professional."
most helpful answer i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds like a difficult situation. i'd recommend you go back to your gynecologist to discuss this situation. i can't think of any reason why you'd have gas constipation and diarrhea while on your period now when you didn't before. also the hot flashes sound like a hormone issue. your gynecologist will want to know about these symptoms in case your pills need to be changed. because you've been on the pills only two months it may be too early to tell if these symptoms will resolve on their own or not. but that's not really the issue. the issue is that you're experiencing new symptoms and you're concerned about them. that alone warrants a visit with your doctor. i wish you all the best at getting this resolved!

there are a number of different products available in the nyquil product line and they have different active ingredients. it is always important to read the label of the particular product you are interested in to verify the ingredients contained in that product. nyquil may contain a pain reliever/fever reducer and when it does it typically contains acetaminophen. if acetaminophen is in your product it may provide adequate relief for your daughters symptoms. however not all nyquil products have a pain reliever/fever reducer in them. and your daughter may take ibuprofen for another reason or may find that the acetaminophen in the nyquil is not sufficient for her problem. in these cases then it would then be fine to take both ibuprofen and nyquil together.

i just read your query. in ayurveda or any other branch of medicine there is no medication that will help you to conceive a baby boy. no medication can do that. moreover the chromosome responsible for baby boy (y chromosome) is inherited by the male partner that means the gender of a baby whether it is a boy or a girl is determined by father and not by mother. some people claim that they give medicine for baby boy and promote them in the name of ayurveda medicine but no medicine can do that. for further doubts consult an ayurveda specialist online  
hi i found this piece of info if this is you? during a tia one of the small blood vessels that supply your brain with oxygen-rich blood becomes blocked. atherosclerosis is a common cause of narrowed arteries. it occurs when fatty deposits known as plaques develop on the inner lining of your blood vessels. this can cause your blood vessels to become thickened hard and less elastic making it more difficult for blood to flow through them. ok if this is you then simple cayenne pepper may help clear this plaque away for you there are many ways to take cayenne you can try capsules the ok but when the capsule opens inside you it can give you the cramps or like me you can mix cayenne with tomato paste and thin with olive oil to start with to a heat that suits you next time you mix you can add a bit more and so on take 3 small spoonful's each morning wash each down with water now if you want because it very good for your blood do a jar of very fine chopped garlic and keep this in olive oil just add a spoonful on top of the cayenne before you take it. all very good for you and give it a couple of weeks to start working at full strength. good luck

certain things make you more likely to develop squamous cell carcinoma:
"oral herpes typically is caused by direct contact like kissing or by fresh exposure to the herpes virus as a fomite (contaminated surfaces). technically if the person using the mouse has an active herpetic lesion on the lip picks at it and then touches the mouse it will be contaminated. if you then touch the mouse and touch your lip and are susceptible to herpes you may get it. these are all big ""if's"" and theoretical. most people have have oral herpes have no clue where they got it or from whom. genital herpes comes from sexual contact orally or during intercourse. less-commonly it could come from shared (contaminated) sex toys but this is not the typical transmission route. you can use your own wireless mouse or at least wipe it off before using it. of course the keyboard desk a pen etc. is going to be a possible fomite as well."
since genetics dictate inherited features and structure there is a significant risk of inheriting the anatomical features that may predispose to a hernia. there may also be inherited factors that result in tissue weakness which ultimately allows the deterioration of the supporting structures and leads to the formation of a hernia. however this does not necessarily imply that the offspring of an individual with a hernia will ultimately develop the problem.

hi when shbg levels are increased beyond what is expected there is likely to be less free testosterone available to the tissues than is indicated by the total testosterone. this could lead to poor libido in men. males: 10-57 nmol/l in men aged 70-89 years modulation of androgen action may occur via an age-related increase in shbg and reduction in free testosterone without a decline in total testosterone concentration. increasing age bmi and lh are independently associated with lower free testosterone. further investigation would be required to assess the clinical consequences of low serum free testosterone particularly in older men in whom total testosterone may be preserved. ok so far so good then i think it works this way your shbg is 118 which is double what it should be this affects your testosterone and lowers it so hence ed has your doctor offered you anything to raise it back up yet? if not you could try some dhea its a hormone this helps raise you testosterone lift your libido and kick up you energy levels but get your wife to keep an eye on you? it can give the odd person some funny side effects. and with this you could take some tribulus this works along the same lines they work together so would help the dhea but this is up to you how you go this is just a suggestion. im on both daily for ed and a whole load of other things that seem to work for my ed and im 67. good luck

this is so variable it would require an individual evaluation. an special x-ray can show growth plates and determine if they have closed or are closing  this will give you an estimatel. better yet seeing a pediatric endocrinologist would take the evaluation to a higher level. thirteen year olds may still have plenty of growth but it will take a hands-on examination review of several years of his growth charts and perhaps an x-ray/labs.

"i can see why it might sound logical that calcium supplementation could help broken bones heal faster. after all bones are made of calcium right? so feeding them calcium should speed up healing. unfortunately that's not how it works. unless you have a pre-existing calcium deficiency (not likely in an otherwise healthy 16-year-old boy) taking calcium will not help your bones heal. the process of bone healing is called ""remodeling. "" your body removes dead bone cells and builds new ones in their place. this process occurs on a pretty predictable schedule. for common fractures like the one you describe the remodeling process normally takes 6 to 8 weeks. unfortunately your son will just have to wait this out. what will help the bones heal on schedule is not engaging in activities that put stress on the areas of the fracture. resting the hand (to keep the fractures stable) will allow the body to do its remodeling job and get the bones back to normal. wishing you well!"

the types of sugar people should limit in the diet are added sugars. sugars that are naturally occurring in milk yogurt and fruit would not count. added sugars would be the sugar that is added to a meal or drink (sugar to coffee or syrup on pancakes) or the addition of sweeteners during processing (granola/energy bars and soda). you can check the ingredient line for sources of added sugars such as brown rice syrup high fructose corn syrup malt syrup molasses corn sweetener honey syrup evaporated cane juice and fruit juice concentrate. for more on added sugars see this webmd article detailing the american heart association recommendations.

fruit smoothies are fine with the exception of those calories which can be surprisingly high. not all smoothies are created equal you know. if you are trying to lose weight i think it would be wise to limit these as a sole breakfast option. once in a while is fine. you will lose more weight and get a bit more mileage if you ate a piece of fruit and had some protein in the morning (like an egg) and a piece of dry toast. less calories. well no. if fruits are healthy then fruit smoothies are not bad either. but watch how much you take in because too much of anything including fruit smoothies can cause health problems like diabetes. that ius when your body cannot process sugar so the food or drink will become extra body fat. at the same time it is good to excersize. so dont worry fruit smoothies are not bad for you.

"the short answer to your question is yes the hydrocodone could possibly be contributing to your husband's sleeplessness. i'd suggest he go back to his health care provider and discuss his medications again to determine if this is the case. hydrocodone is an opioid medication. usually opiod medications depress certain central nervous system functions such as breathing. typical side effects of opioid medications include sleepiness. however a few people might experience what's called a ""paradoxical reaction"" to an opioid pain reliever. this means their body responds in an opposite fashion to the drug. so instead of becoming sleepy from taking an opioid for example a person could become stimulated instead. it's not possible to diagnose a paradoxical reaction through a forum like this. only your husband's health care provider can determine if this is happening with your spouse. your husband should not stop taking the hydrocodone abruptly because this can have unpleasant side effects. instead he'd be well-served to see his health care provider as soon possible to re-evaluate his medications. sorry you're going through this. i hope it gets resolved quickly!"

there is no blood test for the diagnosis of osteoarthritis. blood tests are performed to exclude diseases that can cause secondary osteoarthritis as well as to exclude other arthritis conditions that can mimic osteoarthritis. x-rays of the affected joints can suggest osteoarthritis. the common x-ray findings of osteoarthritis include loss of joint cartilage narrowing of the joint space between adjacent bones and bone spur formation. simple x-ray testing can be very helpful to exclude other causes of pain in a particular joint as well as assist in decision making as to when surgical intervention should be considered. arthrocentesis is often performed in the doctor's office. during arthrocentesis a sterile needle is used to remove joint fluid for analysis. joint fluid analysis is useful in excluding gout infection and other causes of arthritis. removal of joint fluid and injection of corticosteroids into the joints during arthrocentesis can help relieve pain swelling and inflammation. arthroscopy is a surgical technique whereby a doctor inserts a viewing tube into the joint space. abnormalities of and damage to the cartilage and ligaments can be detected and sometimes repaired through the arthroscope. if successful patients can recover from the arthroscopic surgery much more quickly than from open joint surgery. finally a careful analysis of the location duration and character of the joint symptoms and the appearance of the joints helps the doctor in diagnosing osteoarthritis. bony enlargement of the joints from spur formations is characteristic of osteoarthritis. therefore the presence of heberden's nodes bouchard's nodes and bunions of the feet can indicate to the doctor a diagnosis of osteoarthritis.

"yes. anxiety and/or depression would be a normal human response to knowing that you have an ""uncurable severe illness"". treating the anxiety is just as important as trying to treat the illness. i have two types of multiple sclerosis. have had it since i was 16. it is very normal to have anxiety. don't let it overcome you though. take charge as much as can handle and don't hesitate to ask for help. good luck i am a cna that works at an independent living apartment complex for age group 60-100 (just celebrated a 101sst birthday there) many of my people are not far off from being put on hospice. some get depressed for a bit and others look at it as a blessing. in my experience the persons age has alot to do with how much anxiety is shown. one commonality is they all have such great attitudes about living and seeing what the future holds. the 'anxiety' is most definitely present at the beginning. most of them want to make the most out of the time they have left leaving out any treatments that will cause them to be bed bound or will slow them down in anyway. i think the sooner a person comes to terms with their condition and lives to the fullest of their capabilities anxiety will ease."
i suggest you visit a dentist and get your teeth cleaned for gum pain and bleeding. for yellow teeth use baking soda salt and lemon juice paste to brush your teeth and then use normal tooth paste. use this paste twice a week only and it will give you good whitening. also you should maintain oral hygiene properly and use mouthwash after brushing. you can use peel of banana to rub on teeth for whitening but that is not applicable everywhere. visit the dentist soon to get relief from gum pain and bleeding. wish you a good dental health and happiness. for further information consult a dentist online

antifungal medications are used to cure ringworm. ringworm can be treated topically (with external applications) or systemically (for example with oral medications): topical treatment: when fungus affects the skin of the body or the groin many antifungal creams can clear the condition in around two weeks. examples of such preparations include those that contain clotrimazole (cruex cream desenex cream lotrimin cream lotion and solution) miconazole (monistat-derm cream) ketoconazole (nizoral cream) econazole (spectazole) naftifine (naftin) and terbinafine (lamisil cream and solution). these treatments are effective for many cases of foot fungus as well. many of these antifungal creams are available as over-the-counter preparations. it is usually necessary to use topical medications for at least two weeks. systemic treatment: some fungal infections do not respond well to external applications. examples include scalp fungus and fungus of the nails. to penetrate these areas and in cases of particularly severe or extensive disease oral medications can be used. for a long time the only effective antifungal tablet was griseofulvin (fulvicin grifulvin and gris-peg). now other agents are available that are both safer and more effective. these include terbinafine itraconazole (sporanox) and fluconazole (diflucan). oral medications are usually given for a three-month course.
well i'm not going to sugarcoat it. a cystoscopy isn't the most pleasant experience you'll ever have. on the other hand it's not as painful as say a big incision in your abdomen. based on feedback from male friends who have had a cystoscopy i can tell you they describe the discomfort of the procedure as: pinching and pressure. they say it's not so bad they felt they would have preferred sedation especially since the procedure only takes a few minutes. according to my friends the discomfort lasts about an hour or so but there's no pain or burning on urination afterwards. for the urodynamic test you probably will have a urinary (foley) catheter placed and then your bladder will be filled with fluid. in my experience as a nurse many men have told me the sensation of having a catheter placed was quite uncomfortable. those who could relax and focus their attention elsewhere seemed to tolerate the procedure better. and that is my advice to you. as much as possible focus your attention on your breathing. take long slow deep breaths. focus on making your navel (belly button) rise and fall. it may sound wackadoodle but this relaxation technique really does work. also try to hold a mental image in your mind of you walking out of the clinic getting into your car and driving home. this will help remind you the discomfort is only temporary and soon will be over with. i know you'll breeze through these procedures just fine. wishing you well!
do blood test. to confirm urine test is not conclusive.
you bet so if you do not intend to get pregnant it is best for you to use a very effective form of contraception. you cannot use or depend on irregular periods as a contraceptive method. if you have been trying to become pregnant are having difficulty you need to see your women's healthcare provdier for a consultation. every women is different when it comes to their ability to concieve (or not).
most helpful answer i am very sorry but it would not be possible to make any determination without seeing this self-surgery result first-hand. you may have a secondary infection and need more than just neosporin. insurance or not sometimes you just have to bite the bullet and pay for a medical visit if you are worried.
inguinal hernias typically flatten or disappear when they are pushed gently back into place or when you lie down. over time hernias tend to increase in size as the abdominal muscle wall becomes weaker and more tissue bulges through. if you can't push your hernia back into your belly it is incarcerated. a hernia gets incarcerated when tissue moves into the sac of the hernia and fills it up. this is not necessarily an emergency. but if a loop of the intestine is trapped very tightly in the hernia the blood supply to that part of the intestine can be cut off ( strangulated ) causing tissue to die. in a man if tissue is trapped the testicle and its blood vessels can also be damaged. a strangulated hernia is a medical emergency that requires immediate surgery. in adults a hernia that can be pushed back into the abdomen can be surgically repaired at a convenient time. this is because incarceration is rare in adults. a hernia that cannot be pushed back can be repaired when surgery is convenient unless you have increased pain redness of the overlying skin fever nausea and vomiting or abdominal bloating. if any of these symptoms occur the hernia may need to be fixed sooner. inguinal hernias can come back after surgical repair. but in women it is rare for inguinal hernias to recur. fertility is usually not affected by an inguinal hernia or hernia surgery. but in males there is a chance that surgery or an incarcerated hernia can cause injury to the vas deferens the tube that carries sperm from the testicles to the urethra. it is not yet known how often or to what degree this affects a man's ability to father a child. in rare cases surgery or an incarcerated hernia may injure the blood vessels that supply one or both testicles with blood which may cause the affected testicle to shrink. hernias in children infants or children with an inguinal hernia need to have surgery as soon as possible because of the increased risk that a part of the intestine will become trapped and blood supply will be cut off leading to tissue death. incarceration when intestinal or abdominal tissue fills up the sac of a hernia occurs in about 2 or 3 out of 10 infants younger than 6 months who have hernias. most incarcerated hernias occur before the infant is 1 year old. 1 female infants face a higher risk of incarceration. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

all exchange plans are not hmos. there are various plan types being sold though the offerings vary by state and region. you can buy a plan directly through an insurer although if you do you may not be able to take advantage of subsidies. the federal government is testing the option for people eligible for subsidies to sign up directly with insurers but my understanding is that right now that's only an option for people living in texas florida and ohio. keep in mind that when you go directly to one insurer you also miss out on the ability to compare all the plans available to you by shopping the marketplace. it's a good idea to look online at all your options first and then maybe go to the insurer you've found to offer the best option. but again make sure that if you qualify for a subsidy you'll be able to get it if you enroll this way.

there may be no logical reason for this occurrence. it just happens and should not be considered a problem. lubrication during sex is a very complex event but typically the greater the excitation the greater the lubrication. you and your partner must be doing something right. there is really nothing medically that can be done to change the amount of lubrication your body decides to emit.

"that's a good question. a stroke is what we call the death of small portions of brain tissue due to an interruption of oxygen delivery. common causes of stroke include a blood clot (which prevents the flow of oxygen-rich blood to an area of the brain) or a hemorrhage (basically a burst blood vessel in the brain). usually the symptoms of stroke such as weakness only affect one side of the body not both. so if your question is ""can stroke cause weakness in both legs and nothing else "" then the answer is ""probably not"" because a stroke doesn't usually affect both sides of the body at the same time. if your question is ""can stroke cause weakness is one leg and no other body parts on that side "" the answer again is ""probably not. "" usually a stroke causes weakness to the entire side of the body from the face to the toes. everyone should know the symptoms of stroke because stroke is an emergency that requires prompt treatment. if you ever suspect someone is having a stroke do these three things: ask them to give you a big big grin and hold it. does one side of the mouth droop? if so this is a sign of stroke. ask them to extend both arms out at shoulder height and hold them. is the person able to raise both arms equally? if not this can be a sign of stroke. ask them to answer a simple question such as ""what do you see out the window? "" or ""what did you eat for lunch? "" if the person can't give you a coherent answer (if their words don't go together correctly) this can be a sign of stroke. if the person you're testing for stroke does not pass two of the above tests call 911 immediately. when it comes to stroke better safe than sorry! hope this helps. yes! woke up one morning and fell for leg gave out upon standing. waited a few hours before going to er for left leg and foot was very heavy and numb. cat scan showed i had stroke. found out after many more tests that right corotid artery was totally blocked. left leg and foot still numb and heavy."

as much as i would like to help it would be impossible to offer you a diagnosis or treatment blindly over the internet. based solely on your posting your problem may lie in the ear canal (otitis externa) but a treatment is based on the cause (bacterial fungal a combination of both). not something that can be ascertained without a hands-on examination. if you do have debris in your ear canal this will need to be removed by the ent before treatment can be started. you will need to see that ent again.

one more thing that i would like to add is that please tell the reason for getting x ray done?
the simple (albeit gross) answer is spit it out in a tissue if you can. most of the time phlegm will drain down the backs of our throats where it is harmlessly destroyed by powerful stomach acid. phlegm caused by allergies or colds tends to be thin so drying it up using otc antihistamines can be helpful. if phlegm is thick and sticky otc mucous-thinning agents and decongestants are available keeping in mind that this may actually increase the amount of phlegm you may need to expectorate or swallow. decongestants can also be stimulating and interfere with sleep. home remedies like saline nasal sprays gargling humidifying the air and drinking lots of water are effective. persistent darker-colored phlegm may be sign of a sinus infection.
bilirubin is a by-product of the liver system but small amount of bilirubin detected on a urine test strip may not necessarily indcated a problem in this area. concentrated urine can give a false reading so it is up to your doctor to determine the significance. nitrites are positive in the presence of a possible (urinary) infection. again it would be up to your medical provider to determine if this is a possibility.
any time you are vomiting blood it has the potential to be an emergency. if you have an ulcer bad enough to bleed that means stomach acid can be eating away at an unprotected stomach lining - which can lead to a hemorrhage. a good friend of mine nearly died that way. luckily he was taken to a hospital and pulled through.

anytime that you have unprotected sex and are inconsistent with your birth control pills the possibility of pregnancy exists. remember that your body is designed to get pregnant; not to prevent it. while the pill offers you excellent protection you are not being very compliant. unless you get better and taking them you may want to consider a contraceptive method that does not require daily pills. i'm not usually this bad with my pills. i was studying abroad this semester and during the last month i was constantly out of my room getting as much done before i got home. many times i was out when my birth control alarm went off. a few times i forgot before i went to bed. i always doubled up the next morning though. i didn't just completely skip them. he also didn't finish inside me. i know the pre ejaculation still has sperm in it though.

epistaxis (nose bleeds) can have mulitple causes from irritation of your nasal membranes from allergies or colds to just dry air. less-common people who tend to bruise or bleed easily are likely to have more nosebleeds. taking a daily aspirin or any medicine that is known to interfere with blood clotting can cause them. your first step is to read about nosebleeds. webmd has some great information. next you need to know how to appropriately stop a nosebleed (many people think they do but are doing it wrong). nosebleeds that are frequent and from the same side of the nose can be chemically-cauterized by your medical provider. in most cases this will fix the problem.

colds can set the stage for secondary (bacterial) infections so yes. it would be wise to see your medical provider to be examined diagnosed and treated. colds last a week so when someone tells me that they are (a) getting worse after a week and (b) coughing blood there is a clear indication to seek some hands-on medical care.

probably not but you were given the instructions for your procedure so it would be wise to follow them since there are no universal instructions. what matters is what your doctor has instructed you to do. go to the procedure and disclose that you did take the ibuprofen. it is really up to the medical professional doing the procedure to make this call.
i used to smoke a similar amount and would often get pains in my chest on a morning sometimes lasting for a couple of hours. i used to worry about them quite a lot so i quit smoking to see if it would relieve them. the first couple of weeks after quitting the pains got worse but then stopped completely. i've never experienced them since. i'm not a doctor though so i can't say that you are experiencing the same thing as me. but it certainly sounds similar

"a lot depends on why your quality is low. i think you mean something other than a contraceptive when you talk about this ""wellman"" product because contraceptive means that it would prevent pregnancy. some men have poor quality sperm if their testes are too warm for too long. are you either wearing no underwear or wearing boxers? i know you say your diet is good but are you getting a little fat every day and eating plenty of fruits and vegetables and protein? you want to find out what is affecting your quality and fix that if you can."

hi all her symptoms point to sepsis however i have seen same symptoms in some patients with multiple small brain stroke also regarding your tests the repeated use of anti biotics may have increased bacterial resistance usually when we do a culture we search for types of bacteria called gram positive however in rare cases the ones we ignore which are called gram negative could be the cause of the problem (extremely rare) so i recommend doing a brain mri and doing a bacterial gram negative culture. good luck
i'm sorry to hear this elderly lady is going through this. the symptom you describe is worth at least a call to the patient's primary care physician. if she develops sudden difficulty breathing or swelling of the lips or tongue you need to call 911 for immediate medical attention. if the situation has been going on for some time this lady needs to be seen by a health care provider. a number of conditions can cause swollen eyelids and it's important for her to be examined in order to get a correct diagnosis. if the problem came on suddenly i would suspect an allergic reaction. this could be caused by a new medication a new soap an animal in the house bedbugs or many other things. if the situation doesn't clear up quickly then a visit to the doctor is in order. again: if this lovely elder lady develops any life-threatening symptoms please seek emergency medical attention immediately. wishing you all the best!

ive decided that one of the keys to eating healthy while traveling for work or on vacation is a mini fridge especially when you need energy to compete as an athlete. on a recent week-long road trip with my daughter (who was dancing about eight hours a day) we stocked the hotel mini fridge with water chocolate milk apples protein bars and string cheese. on top of the mini fridge we stashed some bananas and nuts. this made it that much easier for my daughter to grab a few things on her way out in the morning. plus it was much more convenient to fuel up on a nutrient-rich snack or beverage in the evening when she had some downtime from dancing. the same would hold true for any athlete health-minded vacationer or time-crunched businessman or woman.

without insurance i would head to an urgent care center for this type of health issue. the clinics are staffed by doctors and they treat a wide range of ailments including infections lacerations and bone fractures  conditions that require immediate medical attention but that dont pose a threat to life or limb. to find a center near you you can check the website of the urgent care association of america: 
"no one is required to buy insurance on the exchanges but if you do not have some type of coverage you may have to pay a penalty. if you have an insurance plan that offers the ""essential health benefits "" you will not face a penalty for being uninsured. if your income is sufficiently low (about $9 000 for an individual) you will not have to pay a penalty. if you are currently uninsured i recommend looking at the options on the exchanges."
"most helpful answer i'm sorry to hear you're experiencing this. there is a particularly nasty virus going around this year that seems to produce a lingering cough. however you should see a health care provider for an evaluation. in general it's not uncommon for a cough to linger as the last symptom to clear up after a cold. that said any time a cough hangs on it's good to see a doctor. the fact your cough is ""productive"" (that is you're coughing up gunk) could be good or bad. it's usually good to be moving that stuff out of your lungs but it could also be indicative of bacteria brewing down there. if you have a fever along with the productive cough you definitely should see a health care provider. i hope you get well soon!"

"most helpful answer so sorry you're going through this. it sounds scary. even if your blood sugar levels tested normal during a routine lab test that doesn't mean you're not having episodes of hypoglycemia. when you say ""my sugar levels are normal when checked "" i'm assuming you're talking about a lab test. have you ever used a hand-held glucometer to have someone check your sugar level when you experience one of these shaking/sweating/passing out episodes? the reason your doctor specifically said to eat something sugary when this happens is to rapidly raise your low blood sugar levels. it's not enough to eat just anything when these episodes occur. carry a candy bar or something very sugary with you to eat when you start to feel these symptoms coming on. passing out for over an hour can indicate dangerously low blood sugar levels. you should not allow that to continue. if you experience an episode like this again and your friends cannot rouse you (wake you up) they need to call 911 immediately. i would strongly recommend going back to the doctor to have your symptoms reevaluated if eating sugar isn't helping when you have one of these episodes. by the way your blood pressure and pulse numbers look very good which is why your doctor wasn't concerned. i hope this helps!"

dental implants are titanium artificial tooth roots. single implants are great because they enable us to treat a missing tooth with a one tooth solution. multiple implants allow us to treat an entire arch or a partial arch with either fixed or removable prosthetics. implants do involve surgery and the expense is determined by how much work is involved.
up until fairly recently the only way to reverse sun damage was to have laser treatments chemical peels or use retinols and prescription tretinoin creams. a revolutionary innovation in the cosmeceutical industry is changing that. now all you may need to do is go to your drugstore or department store and look for products that contain dna repair ingredients. these ingredients now come in every product imaginable â creams lotions serums sunscreens. and heres the wonderful thing: they really do work. dna skin repair ingredients are usually based on enzymes derived from a variety of sources including plankton and plants. most of the major skin care companies are already selling dna repair products and are closely following the new research. all these products seem to improve the skin so it is not necessary to buy the most expensive one. these enzymes work by restoring dna that has been damaged by free radicals most often caused by sun exposure pollution and other environmental factors. dna damage is what causes sagging wrinkles and rough-textured skin. in other words its what makes you look old. dna repair products dont seem to fade brown spots though and though they soften fine lines they wont have the dramatic effect of botox or hyaluronic acid fillers that plump deep creases. still people really notice a difference after a few weeks of using these products and they are usually happy with the results. one of the advantages of most dna repair products is that unlike tretinoin and retinols (which should only be used at night) they do not interact with sunlight and can be used during the day. in fact a few sunscreens already include dna repair ingredients. although the research is still coming in this may be the wave of the future in sun protection.
as you know adderall is a stimulant which in some individuals may cause palpitations or extra heart beats. but in the majority of people who take it it improves quality of life  that's why your doctor prescribed it! mitral valve prolpapse with minimal valve regurgitation is not a diagnosis that would generally have me recommend against adderall. but it's always a good idea to discuss your own situation with your doctor too!

normal 0 false false false en-ca x-none x-none microsoftinternetexplorer4 its from my understanding (and i am not a doctor or anything close) that there is a lot of bacteria in your mouth. some people due to cultural social or bacterial reasons will have different types of bacteria in their mouth as you ones that you've never encountered before. so when you kiss you probably french kiss and when you do you exchange those germs in turn effect your throat and give you a bacterial infection. cavities plaque on your teeth are all caused by bacteria eating and growing on the food particles left in your mouth after you eat. possible solution: you can try using mouthwash afterwards and try to kill the bacteria that enter your own mouth or if your close enough to your partner both use mouth wash before making out. if you live with them you can try to convince them the increase their oral hygiene. in theory you'll eventually build up an immunity to his standard regime of germs in his mouth. you're probably as sensitive as i am! (this used to happen to me all the time with a previous partner but since i've become older i don't have the problem. but my current partner is better at oral hygiene) also you can talk to your doctor about things that you can do to prevent this. obviously no longer kissing is going to be a solution but i doubt that will happen. if it becomes a serious issue and it doesnt go away within 3 days go to a doctor and tell them the possible origin! as some one else pointed out there are also sti's that can cause oral infections ones that are transferred from genitals to/from your mouth/throat. if you're getting seriously sick you need to consider that possibility that they need to be checked out. he may be a carrier or host. but that needs to be discussed with a doctor as well.
all these problems of periods are due to overweight. your expected weight is around 55 kg to 60 kg. it is easy to say just to reduce. but it is quite impossible to reduce so much. please put some effort to do it for at least 2 to 5 kg per month. it is a start. reduce all high calories diet and junk bakery food. but you should not fast. have regular exercise especially for the middle segment of the body like aerobics or brisk walk. all the fat in the body gets converted to hormones. you would have seen big men having breast as their fat is producing the female hormone. this hormone will affect the normal cycle of ovulation and you will not get the periods regularly. your fat distribution will be mainly around mid-segment such as thighs breast back and hip but not below knees and elbows. also there will be black discoloration behind the neck side of breast and inner aspect of thighs. kindly get a scan to check polycystic ovaries. in the meantime also check your empty stomach early morning thyroid profile and serum prolactin. these hormones can also affect your periods and can be corrected. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online

"i learned this trick from a woman i used to work with who at the time just had her 5th child. she said the secret is wearing a girdle for at least 6-8 weeks. your muscles - and everything else that had to get pushed out smashed and repositioned to make room for your little blessing -have all essentially been displaced stretched beyond their limit. you have to ""retrain"" your stomach muscles to hold everything in place - back to their original position and not bulging out making you appear pregnant. i know this works because my sister and her own daughter did not use this trick - both still look pregnant to this day. it worked for me for both of my pregnancies i was back to my original weight and shape. i hope it works for you as well."

leg pains are very common in fm including referred pain nerve pain restless leg syndrome and muscle spasm pain. other causes of leg pain can include disc problems pinched nerves peripheral neuropathy vascular disease joint disease etc. [could p]rior work injuries could be involved? please have your doctor look over any new or persistent pain problems. antidepressents are known to help fm pain in many people. there's been an accumulating body of medical evidence demonstrating how different antidepressant meds: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (like effexor) and tricyclic antidepressants can help decrease fm pain. it's common for patients not to first realize how much a med may be helping until they go off of it. they may understate or underappreciate the med's pain-relieving benefit while on it but realize it must have been working because the pain level escalates once off the med. discuss with your doctor possible additional medicine strategies. i was on effexor for quite a while and found it very effective. however when i started to have problems with muscles and aches. not knowing that i was probably dealing with fibromyalgia. i switched to cymbalta. i have found it to be helpful with the aches. your pain sounds like you may be having problems with your sciatica. a nerve that runs from your lower back down through your butt. and then down the leg. it can be very painful. i have had spinal injections that have been helpful and for a brief time participated in a pain management program. sometimes it is hard to figure what comes first the chronic pain or the depression. i will say that effective pain management does allow me to focus more on dealing with the depression. talk with your doctor about developing a plan that can try to address both issues. best wishes to you.

what should happen? that nurse or medical assistant should be retrained! other than the inflammation which is obvious there should be no long term residuals. i am a bit concerned that you may be having a lymphatic reaction (the red streak) so you medical provider needs to see this and make sure you do not have a secondary infection from this avoidable mistake. don't pay for this extra office visit either. you will still need a proper ppd (and it should be absolutely free! ) and if you need the pneumonia vaccine (administered properly of course) i would insist on a freebee as well.

a fibroscan is a non invasive imaging study that evaluates the degree of liver stiffness or scaring known as fibrosis. it does this by determining the speed of sound waves through the liver utilizing a sonogram. similar to blood tests such as fibrotest and fibrosure the fibroscan works well in determing the 2 extremes of liver disease - minimal or no scarring from cirrhosis. it does not work so well in evaluating moderately damaged livers and this scan is not yet approved in the u. s. liver biopsy while not perfect still remains the gold standard for determining the stage of liver disease.

"there may be a number of reasons why a woman gets depressed. hormone changes or a stressful life event such as a death in the family can cause chemical changes in the brain that lead to depression. depression is also an illness that runs in some families. other times it's not clear what causes depression. during pregnancy during pregnancy these factors may increase a woman's chance of depression: history of depression or substance abuse family history of mental illness little support from family and friends anxiety about the fetus problems with previous pregnancy or birth marital or financial problems young age (of mother) after pregnancy depression after pregnancy is called postpartum depression or peripartum depression. after pregnancy hormonal changes in a woman's body may trigger symptoms of depression. during pregnancy the amount of two female hormones estrogen and progesterone in a woman's body increases greatly. in the first 24 hours after childbirth the amount of these hormones rapidly drops back down to their normal non-pregnant levels. researchers think the fast change in hormone levels may lead to depression just as smaller changes in hormones can affect a woman's moods before she gets her menstrual period. occasionally levels of thyroid hormones may also drop after giving birth. the thyroid is a small gland in the neck that helps to regulate your metabolism (how your body uses and stores energy from food). low thyroid levels can cause symptoms of depression including depressed mood decreased interest in things irritability fatigue difficulty concentrating sleep problems and weight gain. a simple blood test can tell if this condition is causing a woman's depression. if so thyroid medicine can be prescribed by a doctor. other factors that may contribute to postpartum depression include: feeling tired after delivery broken sleep patterns and not enough rest often keeps a new mother from regaining her full strength for weeks. feeling overwhelmed with a new or another baby to take care of and doubting your ability to be a good mother. feeling stress from changes in work and home routines. sometimes women think they have to be ""super mom"" or perfect which is not realistic and can add stress. having feelings of loss  loss of identity of who you are or were before having the baby loss of control loss of your pre-pregnancy figure and feeling less attractive. having less free time and less control over time. having to stay home indoors for longer periods of time and having less time to spend with your partner and loved ones."

there are certain key foods that really seem to keep you feeling satisfied for longer such as beans! i find when i have a bean burrito for example even if it's on the smaller side it really stays with me. another bean idea is edamame (green soybeans) just a bowl of these can really satisfy your hunger. basically foods with a lot of soluble fiber or protein and/or water content help make this happen. beans are rich in all three. smart fats can keep the contents in the stomach a little longer too. foods with monounsaturated fat (olive oil olives nuts) and omega-3s (fish canola oil walnuts soy and pecans). here are some foods rich in soluble fiber: beans. oats. barley  look for soups with barley! some fruits (apples mango plums kiwi pears blackberries strawberries raspberries peaches citrus fruits). some vegetables (artichoke celery root sweet potato parsnip turnip acorn squash potato with skin brussel sprouts cabbage green peas broccoli carrots cauliflower asparagus and beets). one of the best pieces of advice for you though may be to drink some hot tea when you are feeling hungry again keep some liquid in your stomach and warm liquid tends to hang out in the stomach a little longer too. green tea is full of helpful phytochemicals so find some flavors you really enjoy (tropical green or peppermint green tea etc. ) or warm up some broth or tomato-based soups as a mid-meal snack.

"arthropathy just means joint problem.  doctors often use arthropathy interchangeably with arthritis which means ""joint inflammation. "" there are some forms of arthropathy that are distinct from arthritis: neuropathic arthropathy: nerve damage from diabetes or another nerve condition results in slow damage to joints. in diabetic people arthropathy usually affects the foot and ankle. (arthritis may also be present. ) hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy: the ends of bones in the ankles knees wrists and elbows start to grow abnormally and painfully in an adult. the tips of the fingers become rounded called clubbing. this form of arthropathy occurs more often in people with lung cancer. hemarthrosis: bleeding into a joint like the knee can occur after injuries or medical procedures and is a common problem in people with hemophilia. arthritis is common and other arthropathies are uncommon so in most cases when a doctor says arthropathy it means arthritis."

most helpful answer first you cannot conclusively tell past sexual activity by having a pap smear and second if your gyn did tell your parents you would end up being a rich woman since this would be a serious violation of patient confidenitality. i would like to think that no medical provider would be so stupid as to do this.
i do not know the spacing of your cycles or anything about your sexual practices or medical history but i would say that a few days late on your period would be a bit early. while some pregnancy tests can be accurate this soon i think you really want a accurate result. wait a week or so.
"cortisol plays an important role in human nutrition. it regulates energy by selecting the right type and amount of substrate (carbohydrate fat or protein) the body needs to meet the physiological demands placed on it. when chronically elevated cortisol can have deleterious effect on weight immune function and chronic disease risk. cortisol along with epinephrine is best known for its involvement in what the medical profession say in the ""fight-or-flight response and temporary increase in energy production at the expense of processes that are not required for immediate survival. let me see if i can clarify this: an individual or person is faced with a stressor a complex hormonal cascade ensues and the adrenals secrete cortisol then cortisol prepares the body for a fight-or-flight response by flooding it with glucose supplying an immediate energy source to large muscles. cortisol inhibits insulin production in an attempt to prevent glucose from being stored favoring its immediate use. cortisol narrows the arteries while the epinephrine increases heart rate both of which force blood to pump harder and faster. then this may cause the person to think he may be having a heart attack. the individual addresses and resolves the situation. hormone levels return to normal. in short the theory is that with our ever-stressed fast paced lifestyle our bodies are pumping out cortisol almost constantly which can cause problems on our health. our whole bodies are mediated by hormones and the immune system identifies cortisol as just one of many players. but if we isolate its role we can put into context the many complex mechanisms that lead to specific physiological damage. under stressful conditions cortisol provides the body with glucose by tapping into protein stores via gluconeogenesis in the liver. this energy can help an indiviual fight or flee a stressor. however elevated cortisol over the long term consistently produces glucose leading to increased blood sugar levels. ask your doctor for any information on diabetes and tell him what specifically you are looking for i am sure that they have the information. if you still are having problems ask your doctor to send you to a diabetic counselor or management counselor to help you to understand diabetes. i do hope you get to feeling better and please keep us informed how you are doing. thank you."

yes those symptoms may not be coincidental. however you might need to wait a little longer to see if you are hiv positive. test results may be incorrect if you're tested too soon. they have a test where they prick your finger just like a diabetes test. it's completely painless and it takes 15 minutes. they test for hiv antibodies and that's why you might need to wait a little longer to test. if you have an outreach center near you they offer tests for free. also was the rash white? that's a common thing for hiv. flu symptoms are a common indicator. it's certainly possible. the best way is to see if that person you had an interaction with 100% is infected. bring him/her to a test center. even if it's negative he/she could still be a carrier. it's scary but you can definitely get it under control if you feel extremely off and in danger visit the er just in case it's something else.

doctors can diagnose influenza ( flu ) using your symptoms alone if many cases of a similar illness have occurred in the community and if the local health department has confirmed a flu outbreak. tests to confirm you have the flu and to determine the type of virus may be important if: the results may affect treatment decisions. during a confirmed flu outbreak however testing may not be needed even if treatment with an antiviral medication is being considered. in addition to flu-like symptoms you have any unusual symptoms that suggest another condition. health authorities have not identified any other cases of flu in your area. testing may involve blood tests (rarely used) or a culture to identify the virus. some cultures take 24 to 48 hours for results so they will not help your doctor decide whether to prescribe an antiviral medication. a rapid flu test is now available that gives results in 30 minutes. although this test is not 100% accurate it can be useful when deciding whether to use an antiviral medication. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

that's a great question for your doctor. i'd say to wear them until your doctor tells you it's ok to stop. compression stockings are worn after procedures like hip replacement to help reduce the chance of a blood clot ( deep vein thrombosis or dvt ). dvts may not occur until a couple of weeks post-surgery so you should wear the hose at least that long. if you have any fluid buildup in your legs you also need to keep wearing the compression stockings. fluid buildup can be a sign of poor circulation which again can lead to the development of a dvt. so in a nutshell seek your surgeon's advice as to when you can stop wearing the stockings. and don't stop too soon! all the best to you!

women taking antiviral drugs for herpes  either daily suppressive therapy or occasional therapy for outbreaks  should consult their doctor about whether to take the drugs during pregnancy. the answer is not set in stone: you and your doctor have to discuss the risks and benefits to decide what's right for you. herpes infection in a newborn is also serious. do not allow anyone with a cold sore on the mouth to kiss the baby. if you have a cold sore don't kiss the baby and wash your hands with soap and water before touching the baby.
i don't know my chip-loving friend. i guess you just like them. we tend to choose what we eat and you are choosing this odd high-salt high carbo combination (a little protein in the cheese) instead of a normal balanced diet. what? no vegetables? at least you should add some lettuce olives salsa and vegetarian refried beans to the combo. make it a super-nacho! if you fear that this is an odd craving due to an underlying medical condition i can't think of one but i would advise you to eat a bit more sensible than that.

you should always have the final say with what goes on with your health and your body. if you believe you have a health condition you did a good thing to express your concerns with your doctor. unfortunately your doctor doesnt seem to be legitimizing or validating your concerns. your doctor may have good reason however to not support your claims. think back to the explanation that your doctor provided for you â is there any possibility that he or she could be right? research online is great but medical advice from a doctor is of course very credible as well. your doctor may have limited exposure to the condition though so maybe you could find a specialist in the area. its important to consider the source of your information. another point to consider is that maybe you didnt express yourself well enough. print out some of the research that youve found and try talking to your doctor about what could be causing some of the specific symptoms. in general its also important to consider the test itself too. how accurate and reliable is it? is it invasive or are there risks to having it done? what are the pros and cons of doing the testing? theres no harm in getting a second opinion. just as different people may have different political views; doctors may have differing medical views as well. maybe you can find a different doctor that will better support your views or help you to understand why testing may not be in your best interest. you always have the right to change doctors especially if you have one who will not listen to your concerns. maybe he is not familiar with this condition called sads.

at four months of age many babies will start to laugh and squeal adding to the happiness of your day. their hands tend to be more open (and less fisted) so they will be interested in reaching for objects and may try to bring it to their mouths. if they get enough tummy time you should expect to see your 4 month old attempt to roll from front to back. at 4 months babies are much more social and you will notice that they are generally happier when they are upright and can see what is going on. you may notice that feedings take longer if there are a lot of distractions like older brothers and sisters playing in the same room. .

hi this is from  it should answer your question. if left untreated the infection may seriously affect the womb (uterus) and fallopian tubes - this is called pelvic inflammatory disease (pid). about 2-5 women in 100 with chlamydia develop pid. this may develop suddenly and cause a high temperature (fever) and pain. it can also develop slowly over months or years without causing symptoms (also known as silent pid). however over time scarring or damage to the fallopian tubes may occur and can cause: chronic (persistent) pelvic pain. difficulty becoming pregnant (infertility). if you become pregnant you have an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. in this condition the pregnancy develops in a fallopian tube and can cause serious life-threatening problems. the risk of developing some complications of pregnancy such as miscarriage premature birth and stillbirth is increased in pregnant women with untreated chlamydia. if you have untreated chlamydia during childbirth your baby may develop a chlamydial infection of their eye or lung during the birth. possibly reduced fertility in men. reiter's syndrome is a rare complication which can occur in both men and women. this causes arthritis and eye inflammation. it may be due to the immune system 'over-reacting' to chlamydial infection in some cases. hope this is what your looking for. good luck

"apparently dr. oz just did a piece about ""the triangle of death""that area from between your eyes to just below the corners of your mouth. most people will have their hands in and around there doing something either consciously or sub-consciously at least once a day. pulling nose hair and popping zits on the nose and near the lips can easily lead to infection including infections that can spread to the brain. i'm not suggesting you did any of those things but swelling is a common sign of infection. i would see a doctor asap. here is some more information i just googled using the words: pulling nose hairs infection swollen good luck and take care!"

"an allergic reaction would typically itch and have hives but not always. i have no way of really knowing if you had a cefzil allergic reaction or not but you can have a skin test to be sure. a person with 5th disease (erythema infectiosum) can have occasional ""relapses"" of the lacy rash on the lower arms and thighs as well as the characteristic ""slapped face"" appearance for weeks after the initial disease."

there are lot of medical issues which can occur from tattooing like hiv infection tetanus hepatitis b and c and allergic reactions. nowadays tattooists reduced such risks by following universal precautions working with single use items and sterilizing their equipment after each use. as you mentioned your piercing was done only till the epidermis the infection is highly unlikely (very very less chance) that you will contact any infection. even if the needle was infected it requires contact with body fluids like blood. so you can relax. still i would like to make the following points:- in case of an hiv infection the test takes about 2-3 months to be positive. hence there is no way to find out if you got infected which is again highly unlikely. there is something called post-exposure prophylaxis (pep) given to individuals who have been exposed to the virus and includes three drugs given only under doctor's supervision. you can discuss this with your doctor. if you frequently get a tattoo done make sure your tetanus and hepatitis b vaccines are up-to-date. always have clear knowledge about the infections spread by tattooing like hiv and hepatitis and their mode of spread. take care and stay safe. for further doubts consult a hiv aids specialist online

muscle relaxants are not that helpful and i rarely prescribe them for teenagers and even adults. muscle relaxants tend to be overly sedative. cold compresses ibuprofen and a restriction of aggravating activities can do wonders over time.
i understand your concern. escitalopram may not help you to sleep since it does not have much sedative property. feliz plus has clonazepam in it which will aid in sleep but is not recommended long term. since you have not mentioned any other symptoms regarding the prescription of stalopam i am assuming that you do not have any other symptoms except sleep disturbance. for a beginning start practising sleep hygiene do a bit of exercise in the evening and avoid drinking coffee after 5 pm. if you are still unable to get sleep then i suggest you tablet ramelteon 8 mg known by brand name rametax which is very physiological and devoid of side effects. consult your specialist doctor discuss with him or her and take medicine with consent. but i will advise you to try the non-medical approach. if you have symptoms of anxiety or depression then it is better to continue stalopam. for further information consult a psychiatrist online

"when your penis is inflated, the prosthesis makes it stiff and thick, similar to a natural erection, although most men rate it as shorter than they'd normally have. but newer models have cylinders that may increase the length, thickness, and stiffness."
"diagnosing your medical condition will require a through patient interview detailing past medical conditions confirming when symptoms first appeared family history age sex medications being taken pain quality (describing your pain as burning after eating may suggest a gastric type of disturbance) and a physical examination. it can be a time consuming challenge to both you and your medical professional to eventually come-up with an accurate diagnosis. one point to note is that some pain can be characterized as ""referred pain"". that is pain originating from one anatomical location but causing pain in another location. a differential type of diagnosing technique may be employed and require more blood studies cardiac testing c. t. scans x-rays and other testing. some common disturbances were addressed in the emergency room but a boatload of other possible medical conditions still remain. upper right abdominal pain can be caused by many medical conditions including: gastric disturbances - pancreatitis irritable bowel syndrome lactose intolerance crohn's disease intestinal obstruction ulcers and others. liver conditions - gallstones viral hepatitis cholecystitis and others. allergic conditions such as angioedema. renal system conditions - kidney stones pyelonephritis and others. cancer - bowel lesions and others. respiratory conditions such as pneumonia. cardiovascular disease - your symptoms will require the painstaking investigative work by a competent and methodical physician. one- by- one all possible causes must be eliminated until only one remains."
as a clinician we are not really sure who gave what to whom when it comes to chlamydia. our goal is just to treat our patient and treat the partner. doing an extensive investigation as to who brought the std into the relationship is really not something we do. clearly you were exposed by someone. whether he tests positive or not is really irrelevant at this point if you are both treated and both test negative again. the urine dna test is very accurate but like most tests few lab tests are really 100% accurate. there may be variables in collecting the specimen and processing it in the lab. chlamydia can be asymptomatic in both men and women so you could have had it for a long time. the important thing is that it was found and successfully treated.
menstrual cramps very common. there are few different ways that can be treated. the first way is actually through a heating pad or using something like thermacare makes a heat wrap that could be applied to the inside of the clothing and it'll provide heat. and heat has been found to be very beneficial in treating that. also where appropriate you could take things like ibuprofen or motrin advil or even aleve. we want to make sure that the patients understand they need to take this with food. on a full stomach because if you don't you might experience a little bit of an upset stomach or some stomach cramping. and also just try to get some rest and eat well. so many times females are running around they are trying to take care of our families and do a lot of different things. but we forget to take care of ourselves at the end of the day. so just making sure that you get a little extra sleep around this particular time of the month and also making sure that you are eating well that's very important as well.

while parkinson's disease usually progresses slowly eventually the most basic daily routines may be affected â from socializing with friends and enjoying normal relationships with family members to earning a living and taking care of a home. these changes can be difficult to accept. support groups can help people cope with the disease emotionally. these groups can also provide valuable information advice and experience to help people with parkinson's disease their families and their caregivers deal with a wide range of issues including locating doctors familiar with the disease and coping with physical limitations. individual or family counseling also may help people find ways to cope with parkinson's disease. people with parkinson's disease also can benefit from being proactive and finding out as much as possible about the disease in order to alleviate fear of the unknown and to take a positive role in maintaining their health. many people with parkinson's disease continue to work either full- or part-time although eventually they may need to adjust their schedule and working environment to cope with the disease.

"like many stds, hpv does not always have visible symptoms. but when symptoms happen, they may include warts around the genital area. in women, warts can develop on the outside and inside of the vagina, on the cervix, or around the anus. in men, they may be seen on the tip of the penis, the shaft of the penis, on the scrotum, or around the anus. genital warts also can develop in the mouth or throat of a person who has had oral sex with an infected person."

i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. here's the thing. this could be some sort of blemish like a clogged pore but that pimple also could be the sign of a sexually transmitted disease. even if you've never had unprotected sex you should see a gynecologist while that pimple is active so that he or she can diagnose the problem. i'd suggest calling to make an appointment as soon as possible. meanwhile you should avoid having sex even with a condom. condoms may not fully protect your partner against certain stds such as genital herpes. best of luck to you!
why take the chance? i found this article very informative. 
are you old enough to be possibly experiencing menopause? if not you should consult your doctor and he may want to do a fbs (fasting blood sugar) and check you for diabetes. drink lots and lots of water not soft drinks or anything with sugar added just lots of water. even if you are not old enough for menopause (though some women do experience it at a young age even as young as early 30's) this is rare but it could happen. you should see your doctor and let him test you for diabetes get a complete cbc and ck all your hormone levels.
you say you are not overweight and do not state your weight so it seems that focusing on the scale isn't the right answer. instead focus on creating a healthy lifestyle that is sustainable and above all enjoyable. incorporate healthy habits that make you feel good like regular exercise and eating fruits vegetables whole grains lean protein sources low fat dairy healthy fats and sensibly include energy-dense foods you really love. aim to get the right amount o food for your body by providing yourself with regular balanced meals eating at the table and stopping when satisfied and comfortably full. avoid eating in front of the tv or as a way to handle stress. a recent study with women around your age showed that those who were at a normal weight but dissatisfied with their bodies gained more weight over time than those satisfied with their bodies. if you chase the perfect body and diet frequently it may increase your risk of future weight gain. take the time to create a healthy lifestyle that fits your preferences and the right weight for you will follow. good luck!
as a man ages the prostate can grow larger. when a man reaches the age of 40 the prostate gland might have increased from the size of a walnut to that of an apricot. by the time he reaches the age of 60 it might be the size of a lemon. because it surrounds part of the urethra the enlarged prostate can squeeze the urethra. this causes problems in the passing of urine. typically these problems passing urine don't occur in men until they are age 50 or older. they can though occur earlier. an enlarged prostate is also called benign (noncancerous) prostatic hyperplasia or bph. it is common and cannot be prevented. age and a family history of bph are risk factors. eight out of every 10 men eventually develop an enlarged prostate. about 90% of men over the age of 85 will have bph. about 30% of men will find their symptoms bothersome. symptoms of an enlarged prostate may include: trouble starting to urinate or urinating freely. having to urinate frequently particularly at night. feeling that the bladder is not empty after urinating. feeling a sudden urge to urinate. having to stop and start repeatedly while urinating. having to strain to urinate. to maintain prostate health it is important for men who have early symptoms of bph to see their doctor. bph is a progressive disease. it can lead to serious although rare health problems such as kidney or bladder damage.

teeth need to be replaced for several reasons. to prevent surrounding teeth from tipping to prevent opposing teeth from extruding for protecting the integrity of your occlusion or bite. it also helps to keep the missing tooth as a one-tooth-problem. if you feel that you do not want an implant there are other options such as bridges and removable dentures. there is also the aesthetic reason if the missing tooth is visible. and you also want to preserve the chewing efficiency of your mouth.
the appearance of vaginal mucous is not a definitive sign of ovulation. assuming you are on an oral contraceptive (you did not specify) and taking it properly it is unlikely that you ovulated. yes people can get pregnant even on birth control pills since the effectiveness is not 100% so it may be wise to use a secondary method as well (like condoms). statistically you are probably just fine with your contraception so relax.
exercise. physical activity strengths your heart just like other muscles in your body.

yes aleve and different nsaids (aspirin ibuprofen and remedy just meds like toradol furthermore the late claims against vioxx) can result in heart palpitations and you are taking a higher measurements than is prescribed (the pill supplement says don't take more than 2 in 24 hours). on the off chance that torment has been a real issue for you i'd go to a specialist and let him know/her that you have terrible symptoms from aleve and request help with whatever is bringing about you the agony. there are much more secure torment relievers out there than nsaids (even opiates are more secure when taken as recommended). nsaids have the danger of bringing on stomach ulcers and heart issues. anyway i'd enlighten your doc reality regarding your twofold dosing and take after their recommendation (accepting the doc is able which is frequently not protected to expect).
there are several effective treatments for shingles. drugs that fight viruses (antivirals) such as acyclovir (zovirax) valacyclovir (valtrex) or famciclovir (famvir) can reduce the severity and duration of the rash if started early (within 72 hours of the appearance of the rash). in addition to antiviral medications pain medications may be needed for symptom control. both nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and narcotic pain-control medications may be used for pain management in shingles. the affected area should be kept clean. bathing is permitted and the area can be cleansed with soap and water. cool compresses and anti-itching lotions such as calamine lotion may also provide relief. an aluminum acetate solution (burow's or domeboro solution available at your pharmacy) can be used to help dry up the blisters and oozing. in may 2006 the u. s. food and drug administration (fda) approved the first vaccine for adult shingles. the vaccine developed by merck laboratories and known as zostavax is approved for use in adults ages 60 and over who have had chickenpox. the shingles vaccine contains a booster dose of the chickenpox vaccine usually given to children. tests over an initial four-year period showed that the vaccine significantly reduced the incidence of shingles in these older adults. the single-dose vaccine was shown to be more than 60% effective in reducing shingles symptoms and it reduced the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia (phn see above) by at least two-thirds. studies are ongoing to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine over a longer term. there are certain contraindications to receiving the shingles vaccine. people with weakened immune systems due to immune-suppressing medications cancer treatment hiv disease or organ transplants should not receive the shingles vaccine because it contains live weakened viral particles. there is not enough information available from researchers to decide at this point whether zostavax may be beneficial in people younger than 60 years of age. since the chickenpox vaccine is now recommended for children the incidence of chickenpox has been reduced. this is also expected to reduce the incidence of shingles in adults in the future as these vaccinated children age.
cancer. even if you don't inhale you can get a number of different cancers from smoking pipes and cigars. people who smoke cigars regularly are four to 10 times more likely than nonsmokers to die from cancers of the mouth larynx and esophagus. oral cancer can develop anywhere the smoke touches including the lips mouth throat and tongue. people who inhale also increase their risk for cancers of the lung pancreas and bladder. lung disease. cigar and pipe smoking double the risk for the airway damage that leads to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) a lung disease that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. smoking can also worsen existing asthma. heart disease. smoking cigars or pipes increases your likelihood of having heart disease or a stroke. cigars boost the risk of early death from coronary heart disease by 30%. teeth problems. smoking pipes or cigars wreaks havoc on your mouth contributing to gum disease stained teeth bad breath and tooth loss. one study showed that pipe and cigar smokers had an average of four missing teeth. erectile dysfunction. smokers are twice as likely to have erectile dysfunction as nonsmokers. cigars and pipes aren't just dangerous to the people who smoke them. they also give off secondhand smoke filled with toxic chemicals such as carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. because a cigar wrapper (which is made from a tobacco leaf) is less porous than a cigarette wrapper it doesn't burn as thoroughly as a cigarette wrapper. this increases the concentration of cancer-causing substances such as ammonia tar and carbon monoxide released into the air. despite their sweet aroma water pipes are also dangerous to your health. during a typical hookah smoking session you'll inhale 100 to 200 times the volume of smoke that you'd get from a cigarette. water pipes deliver at least as much nicotine and toxins as cigarettes and put users at similar risk for cancer and other smoking-related diseases. the same advice is true for pipe and cigar smokers as for cigarette smokers: quit. if you can't kick the habit on your own get help from your doctor another health professional or a smoking cessation service (1-800-quit-now). also make sure to get regular checkups  including mouth exams to look for signs of oral cancer  and talk to your doctor about getting screened for lung cancer.

fall is the time for apples. whether they are in a salad roasted and served with pork or in a dessert you cant go wrong. one of my favorite and simplest fall deserts is an apple crisp. i love the rustic version that has a bit of fresh thyme and a crumble topping that is as good for you as it is delicious. the great thing about this dessert is 1) its simple to make; 2) it has a balanced amount of butter and sugar so compared to many desserts it is a much healthier choice; and 3) you can serve this easily as a weeknight treat or for a dinner party on the run. start with your favorite apple. i recommend a crispy and tangy one like gala pink lady and honey crisp (avoid mealy apples such as red delicious). from there cut up the apples (i leave the skin on mine) into small chunks (nickel size). toss them in a bowl with fresh thyme (about 1 tablespoon per 4 whole apples) a bit of agave nectar or honey and a light sprinkle of flour. you can add either dried or fresh cranberries for more flavor and a great boost of antioxidants. for the topping combine rolled oats chopped almonds or pecans butter brown sugar and shredded coconut. bake in individual dishes or a large baking dish for about 20-30 minutes. serve warm with vanilla ice cream or fresh whipped cream. this is a great dessert for the holidays and can be made a few days ahead of time and reheated before serving. apples add another simple and healthy flavor boost to pork or chicken dishes. roast apples with a bit of rosemary sage or thyme. serve this hot savory topping over your meat. present the dish on a large white plate with a few fresh sprigs of rosemary and look how fancy you are now!
i do agree with what rod moser has said but i do like to add few more things to this that inhalers are just not the available solution for every problem. keeping in consideration the age of your child i will suggest him some deep breath exercise like :- the stimulating breath (also called the bellows breath) the 4-7-8 (or relaxing breath) exercise breath counting. once he will be fine with these he push himself further more with some more deep breath exercise. for more information you can visit pharmacysell

isn't sex pleasurable enough without putting menthol on your penis? your partner may not like this cooling sensation either. is it harmful? i suspect it is fine but i seriously doubt that the company tested this product on genitals. it is usually for sore joints and muscles. one can have allergic or adverse responses to any product that is used for something that it was not indeed to be used on so obviously your menthol days may be over. this unpleasant sensation should end soon. try a little over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream to relieve the inflammation.
"by taking the ""morning after"" pill you certainly increased your chances of not getting pregnant from this one encounter but this pill is not 100%. your biggest mistake was to agree to unprotected sex. you are still at risk for contracting a sexually-transmitted disease (std). you will need to wait until your next period is due. if you miss your period or have any signs of pregnancy i would suggest that you do a home pregnancy test or see your medical provider. unprotected recreational sex has definite risks: risks of getting pregnant and risks of an std. please don't forget it."
people who choose not to buy health insurance will be charged a penalty of just $95 or 1% of their annual income whichever is higher in 2014. that penalty grows over time. a big concern is that in order to save money people will decide to pay the penalty instead of purchasing coverage and simply wait until they become sick to sign onto a health plan. if thats your plan you may want to reconsider. open enrollment periods will be set up to discourage people from doing this. in year one for example. in most states youll be able to buy insurance through your states new marketplace beginning october 1 2013 through march 31 2014. if you dont sign up for insurance youll be locked out of the market until the following year. if you become sick during that time youll be left to pay for your medical care on your own.
it sounds like your diet may be out of balance. make sure to include 3-5 food groups with main meals and 2-3 with snacks (lean protein whole grains fruit vegetables dairy healthy fats). for example a salad with veggies and dressing includes vegetables and healthy fats but that alone is usually not enough to keep you full. so add a protein source to it (beans/chicken) and round it a piece of whole grain bread and a side of yogurt. the goal is to include foods with a high satiety value meaning they take longer to digest and keep you fuller longer. here are some ways to increase the satiety power of your meals: make sure most of your meals have a source of protein. protein is the most filling of the macronutrients (carbohydrates protein and fat). so include nuts on your cereal a boiled egg or chicken on salads and build your dinner meals around a lean protein source. include healthy fats with your meals. fat also helps to slow digestion and is satisfying. try chopped avocado on salads nuts topped on yogurt and veggies sauteed in olive oil. a healthy fat source at every meal will increase satisfaction. fiber-rich foods are also filling. include fruits and veggies with meals (as you have) whole grains beans/legumes and nuts and seeds. while it's great to eat healthy make sure you eat meals you enjoy that also taste good. that include sweets in moderation. a small piece of dark chocolate or cookie after a meal can increase satisfaction and help keep cravings at bay. keep trying different things until you find meals that are not only healthy but satisfying. i am not an expert and am only answering from my own experience. even back to when i was younger i can remember always being hungry and always eating. people used to comment on how much i ate and that i didn't gain an ounce. i also try to eat healthy and love vegetables. two years ago i was diagnosed with hypoglycemia- low blood sugar- not due to diabetes. especially around the time of my period my blood sugar is hard to control. i feel like i'm starving and of course crave chocolate! i usually give in and then that starts a viscious cycle with my blood sugars. i try to have a variety of vegetables fruits cheeses peanut butter and whole grain snacks (wheat thins triscuits etc) on hand. so if you are feeling the signs- shaky dizzy weak grouchy feel like you could eat a freakin' cow lol! . you may want to have your blood sugars tested. you say that you sleep all night and are still tired the next day. i had this problem for years and it turned out that i have sleep apnea. sleep apnea interferes with rem sleep and though it seems that you sleep all night you are waking up a lot. sleep deprivation due to sleep apnea or for any other reason can cause an imbalance in leptin and grehlin. these hormones affect appetite. i would eat a big supper and in an hour i was physically hungry again and wanting to eat another full meal. i gained 15 pounds in about 3 months before i got treatment for the apnea. you might ask your doctor to assess you for sleep apnea or other sleep problems. you could have low blood sugar or low blood pressure. you might need to go to the doctor for some blood tests. also i have the same problem too. the doctor told me it could be my medication for my thyroid condition. how are you doing with your issue? i feel like this is really rare and you probably would know by now if you have this. prader-willi syndrome will give you an unsatisfiable craving for food (if you are born with this you will have had this eating problem your whole life).
com reflux can be caused due to many reasons  h. pylori stress hiatal hernia are among them. so we need to make sure first that h. pylori is no more there by doing a stool h. pylori test. have your endoscopy showed any thing like hiatal hernia? are you stressed? do you sleep in upright position? are you subsiding all acidic foods and caffeine? and foods that aggrevate symptoms?
"if you're thinking about self-medicating don't do it. have you been diagnosed with a ""bladder infection "" or did you self-diagnose this? if a medical professional diagnosed you with a bladder infection then he or she would have given you a prescription for the appropriate antibiotic to treat that infection. as you seem to be aware different antibiotics are effective for different types of infections. an antibiotic that treats a tooth abscess for example may have no effect on a foot ulcer that got infected. when a person decides to self-diagnose and self-medicate they do themselves a grave disservice. in taking a ""leftover"" antibiotic for a perceived infection they may delay getting the correct diagnosis and treatment. this can allow the infection to get worse spread and cause other complications. if you believe you have a urinary tract infection (much more likely than a ""bladder"" infection) i suggest you go to a clinic or urgent care center. they will take a simple urine sample and tell you right away if your problem requires an antibiotic. many conditions can cause symptoms similar to a uti or bladder infection. even if you'd had a uti before do not assume you ""know"" that's what's causing your symptoms. only a urinalysis can tell you for sure if there are bacteria in your urinary tract. wishing you well!"
teething refers to the time when baby teeth (also called deciduous teeth or primary teeth) appear. generally teething first occurs between 6 months and 24 months of age. while this process is uneventful in some children; for others it causes quite a bit of discomfort and irritability. teething symptoms. some teeth grow with no pain or discomfort at all. at other times you may notice that the gum is sore and red where the tooth is coming through or that one cheek is flushed. your baby may dribble gnaw and chew a lot or just be fretful. also it is important that you start maintaining the oral health of your infant as soon you see the symptoms of teething to avoid future dental problems. there are dental clinics which consists of skilled and experienced pediatricians.
the vaginal area is very vascular so even a tiny sex-related tear can cause some bright red bleeding. since this can heal very fast your gyn may not find the cause of the bleeding if it was caused by minor trauma. please keep in mind that there can be numerous other causes including those related to your iud placement so it would be prudent to see your medical provider since this bleeding is a new phenomena for you.

"i wish that i could answer your question but to blindly comment on a prior surgery would be impossible since i do not know the medical details of your case. only your surgeon can address this issue. please keep in mind that cancer does not always ""stand out"" and be obvious during surgery so it is possible that a tiny piece was missed. i really can't say but at least the follow-up mammogram spotted ""something"". this ""something"" may not necessarily mean a ""piece of cancer"" since there can be many artifacts that mimic a suspicious reading. it is up to you to trust your doctor but medicine is far from 100% perfect 100% of the time. i am sure you will receive an explanation from your doctor. i wish you the very best."

if you are concerned about this person's short stature he should be evaluated by a pediatric endocrinologist (i am assuming this is a child but i do not know the age). there can be medical intervention like hgh (human growth hormone) for some forms of short stature if this intervention is done before the growth plates have closed. again i don't know the age or the reason for the short stature.

the best way to protect your bones while losing weight is to exercise regularly and eat healthy foods. however what if you dont want to take the slow but sure route to weight loss? [if you are] crash dieting for a few weeks for your wedding or some other big event there probably wont be any major impact  although i would always advise making sure you get adequate calcium and vitamin d during that time period  says felicia cosman md medical director of the clinical research center at helen hayes hospital in haverstraw n. y. and an editor of osteoporosis: an evidence-based guide to prevention and management. but long-term crash dieting can have an impact on your bone health cosman says. if you go for six months or so eating 800 or 900 calories a day thats likely to be bad for your bones. i would say that a threshold of at least 1 200 calories per day is about whats needed to maintain your bones and tissues. if your caloric intake is significantly below that for an extended period of time youre probably doing damage.

"you're smart to think about potential drug interactions. whenever you have questions about prescription medications you can check with a pharmacist. pharmacists represent a great resource for all types of drug-related questions including potential interactions. in fact it's a good idea to get all of your prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy. that way the pharmacist is more likely to catch potential drug interactions before you even receive the pills. i'm not a pharmacist myself but i don't believe there's any interaction between minocycline and terbinafine oral. one is an antibiotic and the other an antifungal. generally i believe these two drug classes ""play nice"" together. however you should ask your healthcare provider. if your provider knew you were taking minocycline he or she would not prescribe terbinafine unless it was safe to do so. wishing you well!"

hi this bit below is from webmd so show her this it may help both of you. sometimes you may notice that your menstrual blood becomes dark brown or almost black as you near the end of your period. this is a normal colour change. it happens when the blood is older and not being expelled from the body quickly. temporary thick heavy flow isn't necessarily cause for concern. however regular heavy periods justify a trip to the doctor to check your blood counts. many women become accustomed to heavy periods considering them to be normal. over time though the excess monthly blood loss leads to anemia potentially causing weakness or fatigue. if you ever feel something's not right with your period see your health care provider. as for the pains could be just cramping has she had anything like this before? do hope this helps you. good luck
"if imaging studies find a mass in your pancreas, a pancreatic cancer diagnosis is likely, but not definite. only a biopsy  taking actual tissue from the mass  can diagnose pancreatic cancer."
i suggest you get this checked out by a medical professional. many conditions can cause the symptoms you describe but one that comes to mind is a staph infection. obviously if that's the case you want to get treatment as soon as possible. itching is not normally a sign of staph infection but it still would be good to rule this out. at any rate you're having abnormal symptoms that are worth getting checked. meanwhile be sure to wash your hands thoroughly and often. in the event you have some sort of communicable infection you want to take every precaution not to transmit it to someone else. i wish you all the best!

first and foremost it's important for you to eat regular meals at regular times  breakfast lunch dinner and snack. then you need to understand which foods have carbohydrates and how to eat a consistent amount at meals. this article reviews carb counting and how it works. once you understand which foods have carbohydrates you can plan meals that are easy to prepare. for example oatmeal topped with nuts and fruit for breakfast takes minutes to prepare. lunch can be a tuna or turkey sandwich and a salad and dinner pasta with veggies and a lean protein. this article reviews a sample diabetic meal plan. i understand that you are overwhelmed and would like a list of foods to eat but it will take some learning and patience on your part. i highly recommend seeing an outpatient diabetic educator to learn strategies for controlling your blood sugar. there are some frozen meals you can buy once you understand how much carbs you need and what you need to stay healthy slowly build a list of simple meals you can make including some frozen and you will be in good shape.
hemoglobin has the important role of delivering oxygen to all parts of the body and carrying carbon dioxide back to the lungs so it can be exhaled out of the body. if hemoglobin level is too low which is what happens in anemia this process may be impaired resulting in the body having low oxygen level (hypoxia).
some people do notice that their hair can be thicker and fuller when pregnant and this is a hormonal fluctuation. so what happens is that your hair has three cycles of growth: it has a growing phase a resting phase and a falling out phase. sometimes with the hormones and the changes in pregnancy your hair stays in that growing phase longer. so you have more hair in that growing phase so your hair looks thicker and fuller and grows longer and often is more shiny as well. what happens though is three to four months after pregnancy when those cycle shift back all of a sudden that hair starts to shed as you revert back to your normal hair cycles. so if all your hair grew in the growing phase at the same time and then shifted to the resting phase every two to ten years or so you would go bald completely. but fortunately that pattern is not synchronized. so about 90% of your hair is growing and 10% is resting or falling out. so if that patterns shifts you might notice that your hair looks fuller for a while but there is a price to pay on the other side and then it will balance back out. yes mine did. and then after i had my baby girl i lost quite a bit of it

"there are indeed four basic options in terms of health insurance coverage available through exchanges. sometimes these are referred to as ""metal"" plans because they are bronze silver gold and platinum. the bronze plans cover the lowest percentage of your costs all the way up to platinum plans which will cover the highest percentage of your health costs. as a result bronze plans will generally be the least expensive available and platinum plans will be the most expensive. unfortunately it is not possible now to tell exactly how much you will pay for each of those plans. and the details of these plans will vary. for example there will be different premium costs and somewhat different benefit structures for silver plans even within one state. one insurer may offer a silver plan that costs more than another insurer. we all wish health reform was a little less complicated! and webmd is helping to make things as clear as possible. but the good news is that you should have several options to consider and you should be able to compare actual premium costs and coverage details when the exchanges go live on october 1."
"melatonin should be effective in regulating sleep in people with hypothyroidism. the question is does it make hypothyroidism worse or cause unwanted side effects in patients with auto-immune disorders. the jury is divided on the potential benefits vs. possible drawback of taking melatonin by patients with hypothyroidism. - one group of clinicians believes that melatonin is important for cell growth and has positive thyroid benefits. - other researches believe that hypothyroidism caused by an underactive thyroid gland is an auto-immune disorder (i remember seeing a warning on a bottle of melatonin that it should not be taken by people with auto-immune disorders). studies have suggested that the taking of melatonin by individuals with an auto-immune disorder stimulates inflammation within the body. cited were arthritic patients who condition worsened after taking routine dosages of melatonin. an article in livestrong states "" it (melatonin) may also down-regulate the activity of the thyroid gland. so melatonin could worsen hypothyroidism. "" i would tend to err on the side of caution and not recommend your taking melatonin for sleep or thyroid treatment without consulting your medical professional. synthyroid medication works well in controlling hypothyroidism. other mechanisms are available to treat sleep disorders including herbal teas and positive sleep hygiene techniques. please consider talking with a doctor about this topic. your physician may have their own feelings about your taking melatonin."

prior to the discovery of insulin there was no way for people with iddm to survive without the hormone. the 'sugar sickness' was a wasting syndrome which left people with insulin dependant diabetes unable to process foods. people were treated with diet restrictions or starvation diets in order to help them survive. this condition lead to early death. in 1922 healthcare providers were able to treat this condition with insulin. the drug was first mass produced by eli lilly and later by novo nordisk. insulin is currently produced by a technology that uses human insulin or proinsulin genes that are injected into yeast or e coli. these can mass produce a human form of insulin which is used to treat diabetes

a cataract is a clouding of the lens in the eye that affects vision. most cataracts are related to aging. cataracts are very common in older people. by age 80 more than half of all americans either have a cataract or have had cataract surgery. a cataract can occur in either or both eyes. it cannot spread from one eye to the other. what is the lens? the lens is a clear part of the eye that helps to focus light or an image on the retina. the retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. in a normal eye light passes through the transparent lens to the retina. once it reaches the retina light is changed into nerve signals that are sent to the brain. the lens must be clear for the retina to receive a sharp image. if the lens is cloudy from a cataract the image you see will be blurred. are there other types of cataract? yes. although most cataracts are related to aging there are other types of cataracts: secondary cataract. cataracts can form after surgery for other eye problems such as glaucoma. cataracts also can develop in people who have other health problems such as diabetes. cataracts are sometimes linked to steroid use. traumatic cataract. cataracts can develop after an eye injury sometimes years later. congenital cataract. some babies are born with cataracts or develop them in childhood often in both eyes. these cataracts may be so small that they do not affect vision. if they do the lenses may need to be removed. radiation cataract. cataracts can develop after exposure to some types of radiation.

i certainly understand her reluctance to seek medical attention when she doesn't have insurance. many communities offer free or low-cost clinics to people who are uninsured. maybe you can help her find one of these. i think your daughter needs to get this checked out. it may be completely benign such as a lipoma (a fatty non-cancerous tumor). but then again it could be something more serious. certainly if your daughter has a fever or is experiencing unintended weight loss she needs to be checked out as soon as possible. you might encourage your daughter also by reminding her the cost of an office visit is substantially less than the cost of an emergency room visit so why put off getting this thing looked at? i wish your daughter all the best!
dermal fillers are generally used to fix those nose to mouth lines. that would be from here to here and those are call nasolabial folds. what i found though sometimes is that some people ask for fillers in this area but they have really lost volumes in the temples or in other areas in the face and putting too much filler in that area can create too much fullness without making them look younger and it doesn't always look natural. so you need to have a conversation with your dermatologist about what your concerns are and they can point out to you ways in which you can soften your overall expression in a very natural way. by volumizing the skin and the face in a way that has balance and harmony. because we have so many new products to use between sculptra and hyaluronic acids and radiesse and evolence we have really great products to use and sometimes we use more than one product in the same person in order to achieve that overall natural result. but this is a complete conversation that you need to have with your aesthetic physician which would be dermatologist or plastic surgeon to see what the right treatment is for you.
avoid using your pregnancy as a reason to overeat or to choose low-nutrient high-fat foods over more nutritious fare. giving in too often to pregnancy cravings for high-fat calorie-laden foods such as bacon double cheeseburgers and brownie sundaes can lead to unnecessary weight gain. and it may program your child to prefer unhealthier food choices. a 2007 study in the british journal of nutrition suggests that women who regularly feast on so-called junk food during pregnancy may have children with a propensity for becoming overweight later in life because they prefer the taste of foods rich in sugar fat and calories. a salt-laden diet won't pack on fat but may cause you to retain fluid which will show up on the scale as extra weight. excess fluid may cause discomfort and aggravate high blood pressure. to control cravings for any food prevent yourself from getting too hungry. eat meals and snacks on a regular basis during the day and be sure to combine a source of protein such as hard-cooked eggs and low-fat yogurt with complex carbohydrates including whole-grain breads and cereals. that's not to say your diet must be treat-free. even the healthiest pregnancy eating plan can include moderate portions of the foods you crave but not every day.
there is no home treatment for chlamydia. antibiotics taken exactly as prescribed normally cure chlamydia infections. chlamydia does not cause long-term problems if it is treated before complications develop. untreated chlamydia can lead to many complications. finding out that you have chlamydia may cause you to have negative thoughts or feelings about yourself or about sex. you may feel embarrassed be angry at the person who infected you or feel frustrated with treatment. you may want to seek counseling or join a support group for people with sexually transmitted diseases (stds). you may get counseling from a psychologist a social worker or another counselor. std health clinics may offer counseling and support groups. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

based on your history i would seek medical attention. using plan b twice could cause irregular bleeding but highly unlikely to cause severe suprapubic pain. since you are on the nuva ring you should always insert the birth control even after using plan b. if you became pregnant of course your period would not come the following month but its best to stay on schedule with birth control. if not you start to miss with your cycle which can cause scares. best thing to do would be take a pregnancy test first then call your obgyn and have an appointment set up. also plan b should only be used in emergency cases and is not safe to use every time a mishap comes along.
here's what i suggest: four infections in peak cold and flu season (winter=october through april). three infections in non-peak season (summer). three months of persistent residual fluid behind the eardrum. three back-to-back courses of antibiotics for the same ear infection. if your child fits into one of these categories ask your child's doctor about a specialist referral.

neither. a bacteria is a bacteria. a virus is a virus. vaginal yeast is a yeast (fungus). the duration of treatment as well as the success of your treatment depends on what you are using and how well your body responds to that particular treatment. assuming you were accurately diagnosed and properly treated most women are better in less than a week.
hi primarily this does to seem to be oral cancer. but in early stages only clinical inspection will not confirm it. a biopsy and histopathology will confirm the diagnosis. better to get it done to be on safer side. thanks
"well it's a good question. motivation is the challenge of every person who wants to achieve a goal be it weight loss becoming an oil painter or anything else. it sounds like you may have invested too much time and effort into research. everything feels overwhelming to you right now doesn't it? don't let that stop you. at a certain point you have to take the plunge and do it. stop thinking about it and just do it. i read an interesting article in which a fitness coach said there is no such thing as ""motivation;"" there are only choices. you can choose to eat an apple or you can choose to eat a candy bar. you can choose to take a walk for 10 minutes or you can choose to watch tv instead. do you see the difference here? i strongly suggest you and your friend check out webmd's diet community where you can share your fears struggles goals and successes with others who will cheer you on! you are not the first person to fear getting started on the path to a healthy life and you won't be the last. meanwhile choose goals you know you can easily accomplish. for example: today i will eat one apple instead of a candy bar today i will throw away all the junk food in my house today i will walk for 10 minutes this week i will walk for 10 minutes every day i mean come on! anyone can do 10 minutes of exercise right? of course you can! lastly don't forget to reward yourself for meeting your goals no matter how small they may be. don't use food as a reward. even if you accomplish just one thing today download a new song to your smartphone take a bubble bath or do something else to celebrate the fact that today at least you won. you don't need ""motivation. "" you just need to take the plunge. i say go for it! wishing you well! there are no magic solutions to motivation but i am pleased that you are doing this with a friend. how about a bet? put some money on the line ($100? ) or house-cleaning (if someone fails to meet their goal they have to clean the other person's house). keep in fun and make sure your goals are reasonable and achievable. start with control. cut out the things you know you are not supposed to eat and stop buying them. write down everything you eat for about a week or so (be honest! ) and try to determine the number of calories you are ingesting. make sure you are under 15 calories per pound of ideal body weight (your goal). any one can lose weight. there is only mismatched strategies. something tells me that you are on your way to success. i suggest that you discuss your diet objectives with a physician and also your significant other. your doctor has had positive experience in knowing what diets work and which diets usually do not work. they also will know what is the best diet for you as an individual. your medical professional is in partnership with you to ensure dietary efficacy and safety. your significant other in life is also probably your best friend will be a cheerleader in your corner and most likely will offer you the motivating support system that is routinely missing with most diets. the diet that boasts the greatest statistical success is probably ""weight watchers"". counting points is relatively easy the food is easy to obtain and online supports are built into the dietary system. do not skip meals drink plenty of water and negotiate rewards for yourself (such as new clothing) upon reaching pivotal goals. if you have a dietary setback don't let it be your reason to throw in the towel. as the old chinese proverb suggests. ""fall down 7 times; get back up 8 times. """

"most helpful answer i don't know anything about your medical history to give you an ""okay"". certain types of cancer especially those that may involve the liver and certain types of chemotherapeutic drugs that can cause liver effects may not permit acetaminophen use. because your chemotherapy is soooooo important it would be wise to ask this very patient-specific question directly to your oncologist. don't take acetaminophen until you get the specific ""okay"" from your oncologist."

tablet splitting or pill cutting is a practice that involves patients obtaining higher-strength tablets and breaking the tablet in half quarter or whatever smaller portion they can in an effort to save money. the fda has issued a statement on this practice. splitting tablets are risky for several reasons. 1. ) you might get confused about the right dose especially if you forget to split the tablet; 2. ) splitting a tablet does not guarantee an equal distribution of medication; 3. ) some tablets are hard to split and may even crumble when attempting to split; 4. ) not all pills are safe to split especially capsules and those with specially formulations to control drug release. i suggest not splitting any medication unless you and your health care provider have discussed the risks and benefits.
many (most in fact) causes of bronchitis are viral so the z-pack may have done nothing. the prednisone may be helpful for a reactive/allergic cough but this does not cure a virus either. neither medicine nor your disease should have a direct effect on your period so you may need to consult your doctor yet again to take your evaluation and treatment up another notch.

dark circles are often due to the presence of a vascular plexus located just under the eyes. the skin there is very translucent. so it can result in the appearance of a bluish tint under the eyes. most patients respond to topical retinoids (vitamin a derivative cream) which can help thicken the stratum corneum and minimize the translucency of the skin under your eyes. because the skin there is so thin it is wise to start treatment with a gentle retinoid such as an over-the-counter retinol first.
hi the marrow oedema mentioned in the mri regarding the bones in the ankle is a normal finding after any ankle sprain and anyone will have it. its temporary and should not be worried about. the partial ligaments need strict rest and immobilisation in a plaster cast for atleast 3 weeks followed by ankle strengthening exercises. only tablets wont work. thanks
for common skin warts many dermatologists agree that its perfectly fine to try over-the-counter wart treatments for a couple of months. if your warts dont go away during that time or if they get worse it may be wise to seek medical attention. dermatologists have a variety of wart treatment and removal techniques that are stronger and work faster than commercially available products. also remember that all warts can be mother warts that give rise to additional warts in your skin. so the faster you remove the wart the less likely it will spread.
it's a common question: what are the odds that i'll get pregnant this month? for most couples trying to conceive the odds that a woman will become pregnant in any particular month are about 15% to 25%. but there are some caveats and different things can affect your chances of getting pregnant. they include: age. after you reach 30 your chances of conceiving in any given month diminish and they fall further as you get older dropping steeply in your 40s. irregular menstrual cycles. having an irregular cycle makes it tricky to figure out when you're ovulating which makes it hard to know the ideal time to have sex. frequency of sex. it may seem pretty obvious but the less often you have sex the less likely you are to get pregnant. amount of time you've been trying to conceive. if you haven't gotten pregnant after one year of trying your chances of becoming pregnant may be lower. talk to your doctor about tests for female and male infertility. illnesses or medical conditions that can affect pregnancy.
the key is to stay the course with your doctor to see if anything else shows up. as for your a1c it is just above normal (pre-diabetes range is 5. 7-6. 4). focus on lifestyle factors such as exercise getting enough sleep and diet. you do want to lower your sugar intake but also add nutrient-rich foods like plant based items (fruits vegetables whole grains healthy fats like olive oil and legumes) to your diet. a protein source at most meals and snacks can help maintain blood sugar levels as well. if your a1c doesn't come down after making some changes consider seeing a registered dietitian. for more on pre-diabetes see this article.
nicotine is a powerful stimulant and you can definitely get reactions. while your anxiety may be more complicated than just nicotine it would obviously be best for you not to smoke anymore. there are medications that can help but you will need to see your medical provider to have them prescribed. the effects of the nicotine exposure should be waning each day so it is unlikely that you will have any permanent effects. again since anxiety can be much more complex as to the causes seeing your health care provider would be advised.

one way to calm aching feet and bring down swelling is by resting them on a bag of ice or pack of frozen vegetables covered by a towel for about 10 minutes. you can also get the same benefits from a frozen water bottle when you use it to massage your feet. or try the opposite: you can wrap a warm cloth around your feet and let the heat soothe them.

no only children are guaranteed dental insurance under the law. you would have to purchase a separate dental plan to have that kind of coverage. in some cases medical insurers allow for a pair of glasses but you would have to check plan details to see if that's an offered benefit. it's certainly not a requirement. however prescription coverage is required. you can see a list of 10 essential health benefits all plans are required to cover at health. gov. here's a link to the 10 essential health benefits:

shingles is a skin rash caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox. this virus is called the varicella zoster virus (vzv) and belongs to the herpes family of viruses. after an individual has chickenpox this virus lives dormant in the nervous system and is never fully cleared from the body. under certain circumstances such as emotional stress immune deficiency (from aids or chemotherapy) or with cancer the virus reactivates and causes shingles. in most cases of shingles however a cause for the reactivation of the virus is never found. anyone who has ever had chickenpox is at risk for the development of shingles although it occurs most commonly in people over the age of 60. it has been estimated that up to 1 000 000 cases of shingles occur each year in the u. s. the herpes virus that causes shingles and chickenpox is not the same as the herpes viruses that causes genital herpes (which can be sexually transmitted) or herpes mouth sores. shingles is medically termed herpes zoster.
the biggest concern in a young child with vomiting and diarrhea is the risk for dehydration. i would recommend a fluid electrolyte replacement product like pedialyte for your child. pedialyte will help replace vital nutrients that can be lost while sick. start with a teaspoonful every 5-10 minutes and you can keep increasing as the child is able to tolerate it.

i cannot find anything linking panic attacks to high blood sugars. it seems plausible that increases in stress hormones during a panic attack could temporarily increase blood sugars. your son's a1c and fasting glucose are normal so the high blood sugars are not caused by diabetes.

most helpful answer the chance of getting pregnant during your menses is slim. the chance of you getting an sexually-transmitted disease from having unprotected sex with two different guys is high. did you miss that class when you were in high school? you are considered a high-risk patient so it would be in you best interest to be tested for the plethora of stds out there. in the event that you did not contract one you need to bless your lucky stars. sex is fun. sex is natural but it is not worth dying over. did you all go together and get tested and did you see their results? no? then how do you really know that they don't have anything? if you are going to have multiple sex partners you really should use protection (you should use protection even if its one partner and you don't want to get pregnant. ) just go get tested and use protection next time. i wante to know what type of std' test would have to be done? i know that there clean and so am i. but with that i can still get an std?

yes. every woman ovulates at different times in her menstrual cycle. plus embryos implant in the uterus at different times. so most home pregnancy tests suggest women take the test again in a few days or a week. sometimes women get false negative results (when the test says you are not pregnant and you are) when they test too early in the pregnancy. other times problems with the pregnancy can affect the amount of hcg in the urine. if your hpt is negative test yourself again in a few days or one week. if you keep getting a negative result but think you are pregnant talk with your doctor right away.

this is actually a side-effect of the medication working and drowsiness will actually continue as long as you are taking the medicine it will not subside. so i would advise the patient to let the physician know if it becomes really bothersome they feel that they can't go to work. there is actually a lower shrunk of this medication that is available. so the physician or healthcare provider may want to consider decreasing the dose and basically seeing if that helps the patient better with the drowsiness side-effect. but once again if the patient comes into the pharmacy and says to me you know i feel like i am really tired of this medication and i have to take it a lot of time four-times-a-day is really complicated for a medication. i might be able to say you know let's call your doctor and let's see if we can get them down to a lower dose and if the doctor approves it then we can try that instead. but coming to the pharmacy asking us that's what we are here for. we are the medication experts.
doctors nutritionists and public health authorities most often use the body mass index to define a healthy weight. body mass index (bmi) is your weight in kilograms divided by the square of your height in meters (kg/m2). according to the cdc a bmi of less than 18. 5 is considered underweight. a normal bmi falls within the range of 18. 5 to 24. 9. the bmi range of 25. 0 to 29. 9 is considered overweight and a bmi of 30. 0 or higher is considered obese. . obesity increases the risk for diabetes high blood pressure heart attack stroke certain cancers. losing weight reduces your risk. waist size matters too. even in people who are only slightly overweight a waist circumference greater than 40 inches in men and 35 inches in women increases health risks. dont believe your pant size; it often underestimates waist circumference. measure your waist yourself with a tape measure just below the belly button.
"yes it is possible. urologists seem to believe that it is linked to genuine stress incontinence rather than the urge type of urinary incontinence. if the amount of loss is not large or does not seem to be urine your may be having the controversial diagnosis of ""female ejaculation"". apparent female ejaculation has been long debated in the medical and sex therapy literature. there is an anatomic area analogous to the male prostate which is located behind the anterior vaginal wall (ie area reputed to be the female ""g spot""). this is supposed to be the source of some type of fluid which is ejected. . . given that your leakage is continuous it may well be urine. i would urge you see a urologist for a more ""for sure"" diagnosis. can you have intercourse if you have prolapsed bladder."
"sort of. tendonitis is really ""inflammation of a tendon"" and strain is one way this could happen."
hi yes all these symptoms are related to allergies. get allergen test done and find out the exact allergen. take anti histaminic and vitamin tablets. get thyroid tests done. thanks
it probably has gotten better. i am assuming that nail is no longer sore swollen or painful correct? this is called a subungual hematoma  a pocket of blood that formed under the nail from the injury. in most cases this blood will eventually be reabsorbed by the body and/or the nail will slowly grow out taking this black spot with it. in your case the black spot is likely dried blood on the nail bed that cannot be reabsorbed or is being s l o w l y reabsorbed. this innocent cosmetic imperfection can last quite a while so you may have to cover it up with nail polish (i am guessing from your screen name that you are female). should you ever have a similar crush injury of your nails in the future the pocket can be removed by a tiny bore hole in the nail (surprisingly painless) when it is fresh. this will improve the pain and reduce this slow healing process that you are experiencing now. the nail can be surgically removed but that may be a bit drastic.
not a clue. you would have to specifically ask this surgeon why he/she is making this odd recommendation.
"hello, as you explain the history for giving you a correct opinion i should see his chest x-ray and blood tests. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further. take care regards, dr jnikolla, pulmonologist"

hi. it looks like infection in the parotid gland that can be viral or bacterial in origin. you should consult an oral physician and get evaluated and investigation like x ray saliva culture salivary amylase can help in ruling out the exact cause and treatment can be done accordingly. as of now take a combination of anti-inflammatory painkillers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen. do cool compresses over the cheek. hope this helps.
if you were anorexic you would know. i believe your body is just going through a period where it requires random amounts of nutrients although i'm not sure. anorexia is where a person one who is usually extremely small believes they are overweight or that if they eat they will become overweight. this makes them stop eating. you would probably have symptoms of depression or anxiety if you had anorexia. you should probably trust me lol i've had anorexia.
an ear infection happens when germs such as viruses or bacteria get into the middle ear. this can often happen during or after your child has a cold or runny nose. middle ear infections are very common and occur a lot in kids under 4 because of their ear tubes being smaller. many of these ear infections go away by themselves and some may need antibiotics. because the ear infection is in the middle ear it is not contagious. if the infection is in the outer ear the part closest to the ear lobe it is called an outer ear infection. outer ear infections can occur after kids swim. these are not contagious either and usually just need some antibiotic eardrops to make them get better. if you think your child has an ear infection see your doctor. but remember it will get better soon!
at lower intensities of exercise muscles burn a higher percentage of fat than carbohydrates but not necessarily more total fat or more total calories than at higher intensities. this is a subtle distinction but it's an important one. you get more bang for the buck when muscles burn fat compared with carbohydrates because fat has more than twice the number of calories (nine calories vs. four calories per gram). muscles need more oxygen to burn fat compared with carbohydrates because fat is denser. less oxygen reaches the muscle when you exercise hard or fast and get out of breath. the term sucking wind means that you are working hard to get more oxygen in. when less oxygen reaches the muscles a situation known as oxygen debt carbohydrates become the preferred fuel because they burn completely with less oxygen. with the above information in mind the problem with exercising slowly and at a lower heart rate to burn more fat is that you end up burning fewer total calories and less total fat. consider the following example. let's say you walk for one hour on a treadmill at 3. 0 miles per hour (mph). if you weigh 150 pounds then in one hour you burn approximately 300 calories (a 150-pound person burns 100 calories per mile) and if you walk at 4. 0 mph for one hour then you burn 400 calories. now let's say you burn 70 percent of your calories from fat at 3. 0 mph. that would be. 70 x 300 or 210 calories from fat. now let's say you burn 60 percent of your calories from fat at 4. 0 mph. that would be. 60 x 400 or 240 calories from fat. you can see that at 4. 0 mph you burn less fat by percent but more total fat (and more total calories). as for which form of exercise (slow or fast) will help you lose weight faster it's important to know that to lose weight you must consume fewer calories than you burn no matter how much exercise you do. even if you run a marathon every day you will not lose any weight if you consume more calories than you burn. so whether it's fast or slow exercise you still must consume fewer calories than you burn to lose weight. and just for the record exercise is the single best predictor of maintaining weight loss (it's pretty much guaranteed that you will regain lost weight if you remain sedentary) but the more efficient way of losing weight is to reduce your calorie intake. you should maximize the calorie burn during your workouts as long as you keep it within your physical limits and don't risk injury. this burns more calories and contributes some to weight loss but even more importantly it makes you more aerobically fit. and the more aerobically fit you are the more efficient the muscles will be at burning fat and burning more calories overall.
hi though you have lumbar disc disease the symptoms do not suggest that the pain is due to this reason. the ovarian cysts is causing the symptoms. the nipples are getting sore due to the hormonal changes as a effect of these cysts. consult a gynecologist and start appropriate treatment. thanks
vitamin deficiency especially b6 and b12 can cause these symptoms. although starting on vitamins wont give immediate relief but starting on analgesics will help. a venous / arterial color doppler will rule out the causes related to blood vessels
hi. first thing you should do is gradually quit taking such medicines. you are very young and these medicines will have a very harmful effect on your body in a long run. if you think you have a major complaint you can always see a neurologist and get eeg ct/mri brain to see if there is anything wrong. you should talk about this with your parents and also consult a good counsellor. thanks
"raw salt of any kind from any source does not contain iodine. this includes sea salt rock salt and any other natural form of salt. salt distributors began adding iodine to sodium chloride (table salt) around the 1920s when scientists discovered iodine is essential to thyroid health. when the thyroid gland doesn't get enough iodine it grows very large. this is called 'goiter. ' one hundred years ago it was not uncommon to see people walking around with huge goiters due to lack of iodine in their diet. iodine is not found in many vegetables or other foods (seaweed is the notable exception). companies began adding iodine to salt in the 1920s because almost everyone uses salt in cooking. adding iodine to salt offered a way to make sure people got enough iodine to satisfy the requirements of their thyroid gland. salt with added iodine is called ""iodized"" salt. it's important for most people to eat iodized salt at least occasionally in order to maintain thyroid health. if you don't have thyroid problems you don't need to eat iodized salt all the time. you can use fancy salt like himalayan rock salt. but try to get iodine occasionally since it's an essential nutrient. wishing you well!"

"the answer is yes the only form of birth control that is 100% effective is complete abstinence. the effectiveness of the pill is very user dependent. typically about 8 women out of 100 that use bcp's will get pregnant during the first year of use. however when used as directed only about 1 in 100 women get pregnant. remember that this degree of effectiveness with the pill depends on you taking the pill exactly as directed and at the same time of day every day. abnormal or breakthrough bleeding is common during the first few months of use and its very normal. this typically is just an adjustment that the body needs to make to the newer levels of hormones. the duration of this abnormal bleeding pattern depends on the type of bcp you use and often can last much longer in women taking continuous dose pills. to ease your mind get a pregnancy test done. many over the counter tests can detect pregnancy as early as 6-7 days before a misssed period. also remember that bcp's don't protect against std's so if you are sexually active use a backup method like a condom. there is always a possibility that any kind of birth control besides not having sex will fail. so it is definitely possible that women can get pregnant while on the pill. it is definitely possible to get pregnant while on the pill especially if you have only been on it for a couple months (your body may not have absorbed and reacted to the hormones at a ""normal"" speed) you should take a pregnancy test very soon. if it is negative take one more 1-2 weeks later. if they are both negative it is possible these are just side-effects of how you react to this specific birth control. if it continues to be bothersome or gets worse go to the doctor. have a proffessional pregnancy test done and (asuming it is still negative) discuss changing your contraceptive method. yes my 14 month old son is proof that you can get pregnant on the pill. as my doctor told me its only 99. 9% effective it may be that you are pregnant. feeling nausea."
hi in appropriate and minimal doses rivaroxaban has pretty good tolerance. regular check ups with pt/inr and bt/ct levels should be safe. all other alternative drugs will have more or less similar side effects. thanks

i am sorry for the illness of your brother-in-law. i do not know his medical history and i am not a doctor but ill try to provide you with some information as follows: the symptoms as you describe can occur at any stage of liver disease. but a diagnosis for the condition is not usually made until acute liver failure occurs. sometimes the symptoms appear even when liver disease has not been diagnosed; the condition is called hepatic encephalopathy. because the liver is damaged and cannot adequately remove toxins from the bloodstream the toxins build-up in the body causing confusion fatigue and sometimes hallucinations. hepatic encephalopathy can lead to mental deterioration personality changes coma and even death. but hepatic encephalopathy may also be reversible through treatments directed at removing the toxins and eliminating protein from the diet; patients with hepatic encephalopathy may experience delusions hallucinations or illusions. a delusion is a wrong fixed idea such as. im the king of england.  a hallucination occurs when a person perceives something through the senses where there is no actual stimulus. an example of a hallucination might be seeing rats running down a blank wall. an illusion is a sense oriented defect in which a stimulus is present but incorrectly identified by one of the senses. an example of an illusion might be seeing a crack in a wall and believing that it actually a trail of rats. summary: many times there are no overt symptoms of liver disease during the early stages of liver disease including cirrhosis. it is suspected that your brother-in-law may be in a more advanced stage of liver disease. your brother-in-law appears to be in an acute stage of liver disease that has resulted in toxin build-up within the body causing stage 3 hepatic encephalopathy. hepatic encephalopathy patients may have a reversal of this condition with efficient and timely medical treatment. unfortunately some hepatic encephalopathy patients do not respond to treatment and death may occur. i hope that this answer has been helpful and that you and your family remain well during this period of medical uncertainty.

i would suggest seeing an osteopathy doctor. i believe osteopaths can help your progressing fibrosis.
if you always experience a lack of periods (amenorrhea) when your weight drops below a certain point then that is a sign that your lower weight is not enough to sustain normal periods. while estrogen often decreases when body fat and weight dips too low that may not always be the case. the female body needs a certain percentage of body fat to allow the hormones to work properly. this mixed with strenuous exercise and perhaps a diet lacking in key nutrients and calories is enough to keep your body from having periods. my suggestion to you is to see a registered dietitian who specializes in sports nutrition. they can look at your diet activity level and weight and provide recommendations to stay healthy which includes regular periods. you can find a dietitian near you at eatright. org. good luck and take care of yourself!
hi if any medicines dont work on you then exercises yoga and meditation seem best for you. avoid taking anti epileptic tablets without a pin point diagnosis. gastritis is also known to cause headaches and taking antacids daily may well help you reduce the symptoms. thanks
backaches are usually caused by the strain put on the back muscles changing hormone levels and changes in your posture. recommendations: wear low-heeled (but not flat) shoes. avoid lifting heavy objects. squat down with your knees bent when picking things up instead of bending down at the waist. don't stand on your feet for long periods. if you need to stand for long periods place one foot on a stool or box for support. sit in a chair with good back support or place a small pillow behind your lower back. also place your feet on a footrest or stool. check that your bed is firm. if needed put a board between the mattress and box spring. sleep on your left or right side with a pillow between your legs for support. apply a hot water bottle heating pad on low setting take a warm bath or shower or try massage. perform exercises as advised by your health care provider to make your back muscles stronger and help relieve the soreness. maintain good posture. standing up straight will ease the strain on your back. contact your health care provider if you have a low backache that goes around your stomach and does not go away within one hour after you change position or rest. this might be a sign of premature labor.
"thanks for asking this question because many people don't know that chigger bites differ from mosquito bites in the fact that they leave an open wound rather than a red bump. you can apply a triple antibiotic ointment with a ""pain relief"" component (which is usually a numbing agent) for these types of bites. if you need help in finding these products in a pharmacy just ask we are more than happy to help you."

the feelings associated with lupus can have multiple causes including: outward effects of the disease or its treatment. visible problems such as a facial rash or weight gain from corticosteroids used to treat lupus can affect your physical appearance and self-esteem. work and activity limitations. pain fatigue and other symptoms can make it difficult to do things you once enjoyed. the disease or its treatment may make it necessary to cut back at work or even leave your job completely. this can affect the pleasure you get from your job your sense of purpose and even your income. pain fatigue and other physical symptoms. simply living with pain and other symptoms every day can wear you down. emotionally this can lead to frustration and feelings of hopelessness. social isolation. when you feel bad or use all of your energy just to get through the day social activities may be among the first things to go. concerns about changes in your appearance may also cause you to withdraw. uncertainty about the future. having a chronic unpredictable disease can cause uncertainty and anxiety. you may wonder how the disease will progress whether you will be able to stay independent or how you will manage physically and financially. difficulty with family relationships. having a chronic illness like lupus may make it difficult to take care of your home or family the way you would like to or feel you should. because the disease may come and go and often shows no outward signs your family may not understand why you cant do the things you used to do. they may even question whether your disease is all in your head.

this sounds like exactly what happened to me i was in the most excoriating pain i ever felt and it was blisters and small bumps (not puss filled bumps) i went to the doctor they said they never seen anything like it and swabbed me for herpes but prescribed me the same medicine that you take for bv. the next day after taking the medicine everything went away but i was left not knowing what it really was. this has always bothered me because i felt it must have been a herpes outbreak but i tested negative for herpes. please let me know if you found out what this could have been.
one of the things i talk about in my book is having whats called a powered down hour. and in the power down hour you have 3 twenty minute segments. so the first segment is forgetting stuff done that you just have to get done or it will drive you crazy. so in our house its getting backpacks ready for school finding shoes you know things that you do when you have kids. the second twenty minutes is reserved for hygiene so brush your teeth wash your face maybe even take a hot shower or bath. the final twenty minutes is reserved for meditation relaxation stretching things of that nature that id want you to do in bed and id want you to do it in the dark okay. because what that does is again it sets that mood and allows you to start to fall asleep. now many people dont have an hour before they get into bed so you can do the power down half hour if you want like 10 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes.
hi if like my wife you keep a diary of you periods as a way of tracking them from this you can work out things like when your last period was and from this when it should have been. ok so far if your is just a 28 day period then about day 14 this would have been your last ovulation day give or take a day so if you had sex around two or 3 days before that date bingo you can now put your finger on who's the daddy. good luck
azurette and loestrin are combination oral contraceptives which means they contain an estrogen and progestin that work together to prevent pregnancy. norethindrone 0. 35mg is a progestin-only form of birth control. these forms are generally reserved for women who cannot take estrogens such as women who are breastfeeding. progestin-only forms of birth control are not as effective as combination versions and need to be taken every day with no pill-free days.

hi just been doing a little bit more research and found this small piece of info see when you start doing research as you know you have to fight your way through lots of rubbish but this come out of the rubbish you may like to copy it and show your doctor of all things its from the uk's daily mail its a daily news paper see what you think. breast size is essentially determined by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. while genes are beyond our control lifestyle modifications may be effective in reducing bust size. the main hormone that determines breast size is oestrogen. the more oestrogen you have in your system the bigger your breasts will tend to be. this is why women often find that their breasts enlarge when they take oestrogen-based medication such as the 'combined' pill (a mix of oestrogen and progesterone) or hrt. as far reducing your bust size is concerned i would therefore advise you to avoid using the combined pill. in addition it is important for you to be aware that traces of oestrogen from the pill are excreted in the urine and may make it into the water supply. oestrogen-like compounds (also known as 'xeno-oestrogens') from plastic packaging (including plastic bottles) and industrial residues are also known to contaminate food and drinks. for these reasons i would advise you to drink mineral water from glass bottles whenever possible and avoid processed foods packaged in plastic. meat and possibly some dairy products tend to contain oestrogen and should also be moderated in the diet. oestrogen is broken down in the liver so anything you do to improve liver function might help. eating a diet based on wholefoods fruits and vegetables (preferably organic) with plenty of water and very little caffeine and alcohol should help to maximise your liver function and minimise the impact of oestrogen in your body. you might also try a supplement of the herb agnus castus. one of this herb's chief effects is to increase the level of the hormone progesterone which tends to help moderate and balance the effects of oestrogen in the body. the normal recommended dose of agnus castus is 40 mg of dried herb or 40 drops of concentrated liquid extract once a day or 20 mg of dried herb twice a day. agnus castus preparations are readily available in health food stores. its the part on the liver that could point the way to your problem perhaps something is going wrong there when it comes to your hormones. good luck
hi avoid energy drinks. natural fruit juices with l carnitor will help. thanks
abnormal cravings are not unusual in pregnancy but a craving for chalk could mean that you have a condition called pica; a condition where people want to eat things not usually a part of a human diet. this may include plaster clay dirt or other substances. chalk is primarily calcium and may not be harmful per se but we really don't know for sure or that this would be safe in pregnancy. for some reason pregnant women do not want to be a part of any study that could cause possible harm to their unborn child so the data is nil on this practice. it would be best not to eat chalk if you are pregnant or trying to get pregnant. while it may be hard to prove harm it is really not worth the risk to you and your baby to just try it. here is one of several interesting articles on the subject:

"here are some relaxation exercises to try: two-minute relaxation. switch your thoughts to yourself and your breathing. take a few deep breaths exhaling slowly. mentally scan your body. notice areas that feel tense or cramped. quickly loosen up these areas. let go of as much tension as you can. rotate your head in a smooth circular motion once or twice. (stop any movements that cause pain. ) roll your shoulders forward and backward several times. let all of your muscles completely relax. recall a pleasant thought for a few seconds. take another deep breath and exhale slowly. you should feel relaxed. mind relaxation. close your eyes. breathe normally through your nose. as you exhale silently say to yourself the word ""one "" a short word such as ""peaceful"" or a short phrase such as ""i feel quiet. "" continue for 10 minutes. if your mind wanders gently remind yourself to think about your breathing and your chosen word or phrase. let your breathing become slow and steady. deep breathing relaxation. imagine a spot just below your navel. breathe into that spot and fill your abdomen with air. let the air fill you from the abdomen up then let it out like deflating a balloon. with every long slow breath out you should feel more relaxed."

"for this one time only it shouldn't be a problem to take your birth control pills just five days early to be on a different schedule. many women are deciding to do ""three-month cycling"" - taking the birth control pills continuously for three months in a row; having a menstrual period once every three months. this appears to be safe for most women but always check with your medical provider first if you are planning on doing this."
no. a vaginal yeast infections is caused by yeast (candida monilia). colase  a stool softener  will not cause a yeast infection.
not illegal but very very odd. i strongly believe that a person is certainly entitled to have the name of the doctor be able to research the doctor's credentials/qualifications and certainly the doctor's office location should be disclosed.
most helpful answer no your medications that you listed are not the cause. you do need to see your medical provider about this issue however so you can have an examination and a few diagnostic tests.
well that's kind of weird isn't it? i'm sorry you're going through this. the shoulder and arm area is an odd place to get a rash or a breakout of something like atopic dermatitis. if the rash is happening only on one side it's probably worth having a health care provider look at it though it's probably not any sort of emergency. if the rash is occurring on both shoulders/arms then you might consider causes such as laundry detergent (mild allergy or reaction) dryer sheets wearing new clothes before washing them a change in the type of soap you use (again possibly a mild allergic reaction) or something along those lines. if the rash/blotchiness doesn't clear up on its own or if it gets worse spreads or your begin having swelling of the face/mouth and/or shortness of breath then you need to seek medical care. best wishes as you try to solve this mystery!
yes indeed.
hi lulu as you read through this link below your see how two forms of arthritis is behind the pain.  just click on the link to open it. now what you see below is a post of mine its a good well know mix for lots of problems from blood onwards all very natural and healthy. the way out and clearing away plaque would be to get on cayenne pepper turmeric and garlic take this each morning and see how you go. its all very healthy for you. you just mix cp and turmeric 50/50 in olive oil and then mix with tomato paste and thin it with olive oil at first you just mix this to a heat that suits you and over time you can slowly increase the cp and turmeric. you take 3 teaspoonfuls each morning first thing you wash each spoonful down with water before anything else just after you get up one thing it will warm you up with this which will also help would be very fine chopped garlic just do a whole head chopped fine and keep in olive oil with this you add dried parsley a couple of good desert spoonfuls and mix you just add a teaspoonful on top of the cp an turmeric mix just mix into the top take as said. the parsley its very good for the blood and helps keep your cholesterol down. please do keep both jars in the fridge keeps a lot better that way. now if you google and read up about all three there very good for ed your cholesterol heart and its arteries prostate and ra garlic is also very good for your blood so along with the cp and turmeric your be doing your body the world of good. at first you really need to be taken this 3 times a day the other 2 times just before meals for 2 weeks then just twice a day for 2 weeks then just the once at first thing in the mornings great way to start the day. and yes have had ed now in recovery and do take what is above daily along with other supplements and a hormone. so do hope this helps you. good luck ps this really needs a 12 week trail to see if its going to work for you if its for ra do increase it up the stronger it is the better it works for you. dont forget to up the amount of cp and turmeric as you go on. one last piece of info some cp i got out here in greece was not very hot so changed shops and using a 50/50 mix of cp and chilli powder this i put a heaped teaspoon on top each day along with a heaped teaspoon of turmeric now from a site im on they say to help turmeric get absorbed to take a Â¼ teaspoon of black pepper with it and because if these extra amounts its now 4 teaspoon's each morning. what a great way to light a fire in your stomach to get the day started.
i'm sorry you're dealing with this. skin rashes can be painful and annoying. unfortunately it's impossible to diagnose what this might be without performing a physical examination. from what you're describing this sounds like some type of dermatitis. i doubt it's warts because they usually are not painful or scaly. fortunately many types of dermatitis can be treated with a prescription cream that will heal up the scaly patch of skin. once it heals up the pain should go away. i'd recommend you make an appointment with your primary care provider or a dermatologist the next time this flares up. that way you'll get an accurate diagnosis. best wishes to you!
you are apparently trying to get pregnant since you are not using any form of contraception. assuming your partner is capable of fathering a child it should only be a matter of time assuming you are capable of getting pregnant. these things of course cannot be determined over the internet. take a pregnancy test but be prepared to repeat it in a week or so. you can also see your gynecologist for an exam or more sensitive pregnancy blood test. since you are also have an array of symptoms that may or may not be related to a pregnancy an exam would be highly recommended.
a lot of people are upset about the cost of health care under the law. the fact is the price of health plans are going up for several reasons including the fact that insurers are now required to offer richer benefits and because many of the underwriting practices insurers used to limit their risk (like denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions) are now illegal. for lower income people who qualify for a subsidy the cost of insurance may be quite affordable actually. many will have access to very low or in some cases no-cost coverage. but if your income is above the threshold to qualify you for financial help you'll likely find your costs going up. those optimistic about the long-term effects of the law believe that with millions more americans insured in time health care costs will slow. but that remains to be seen.
as per your query non itchy flat rashes can be due to sjogrens syndrome and is a commonly seen symptom. in case if the symptoms recur please consult a rheumatologist and get evaluated. hope this helps. regards.
"nonsurgical spinal decompression is a type of motorized traction that may help relieve back pain. spinal decompression works by gently stretching the spine. that changes the force and position of the spine. this change takes pressure off the spinal disks  gel-like cushions between the bones in your spine  by creating negative pressure in the disc. as a result, bulging or herniated disks may retract, taking pressure off nerves and other structures in your spine. this helps promote movement of water, oxygen, and nutrient-rich fluids into the disks so they can heal."
the simple answer unfortunately is no. the provision of the health reform law that started last september applies to insurance plans that exist or are newly purchased (grandfathered plans are exempt). the benefit does not extend to people without insurance. unfortunately those currently uninsured won't reap the benefits of this provision until 2014 when preventive services will be free under any health plan sold through health insurance exchanges. no doubt that's not the answer people want to hear. the law is scheduled to roll out in stages with the most significant provision â the requirement that everyone have access to health insurance â kicking in only two and half years from now on jan. 1 2014. if you're unable to afford health insurance on the private insurance market it's worth checking to see if you might be eligible for public options in your state. coverageforall. org is a resource offered by the foundation for health coverage education (fhce). on its web site you can search for insurance options around the country in one convenient place. go to the organization's eligibility quiz which will help you identify program information tailored to your specific needs along with associated costs a sign-up check list and links to every program available in your state. and at benefits. gov you can search for all of the government programs for which you may be eligible. you can also speak with someone by phone at: 800-fed-info.

exploration of thier bodies is normal behavior for toddlers and preschoolers. about 1/3 of children this age occasionally masturbate. this may happen when they are bored or sleepy and they can appear dazed and pre-occupied. most kids who do this will continue to do it occasionally until age 5 or 6 at which point they may do it privately. masturbation does not cause any physical or psychological harm. as long as it is not done in public it is not harmful. it is important not to be upset in front of your child and just to set parameters such as 'you can do that when you are in your room or when you are going to sleep'. reacting negatively will not help it stop. if you are not sure this is masturbation talk to your doctor. also if you are worried or concerned speak to your pediatrician.

hi try this it should help you as a very good answer. from the moment they were introduced in the early 1960s birth control pills have been one of the most popular forms of contraception taken by millions of women in the united states and worldwide. when taken correctly birth control pills can be up to 99% effective in preventing pregnancy. however women who are taking birth control pills do on rare occasions get pregnant. when this happens it is most often because of something the women did (or more likely did not do) not because the pill itself somehow failed to work. read more: #ixzz2os8fqcct you can get more info from the site so hope it helps. good luck

one of the things that you mentioned is the fact that this patient stated that they were taking it 15 minutes before. i will say they could consider taking it 30 minutes that extra time actually decrease the bloating and the abdominal cramping. however these are common side-effects with carafate. we probably would refer them back to their physician because carafate is used in the treatment of healing an ulcer it forms like a band-aid over it. so it protects your stomach lining from food and acid. if the ulcer is pretty much healed there is a possibility that the patient may not need to take the medication anymore or we need to find that out and refer them back to the physician or healthcare provider to find that out.

your best bet for a good answer to this question is to consult your pharmacist. that said we usually tell women taking oral birth control pills to use secondary birth control (such as a condom) when taking any antibiotic (such as bactrim) because some antibiotics may reduce the effectiveness of birth control pills. bottom line: if you don't know for sure if a particular drug is interfering with your birth control pills always use a back-up solution. hope this helps!

dextromethorophan is a cough suppressant; guaifenesin is a mucous-thinning medication that can actually increase a cough. if you goal is to stop/control a cough especially at night then dextromethorophan (assuming it is not included in a combination product containing a decongestant) is what you would use. if you goal is to thin a cough so that a person can spit it up then guaifenesin (during the day) would be helpful if the person is capable of coughing up phlegm. children often cannot do this. guaifenesin at bedtime will most likely increase the cough because of post-nasal drainage.
stretch marks are a type of scar tissue that forms when the skin's normal elasticity is not enough for the stretching required during pregnancy. they usually appear on the abdomen and can also appear on the breasts buttocks or thighs. while they won't disappear completely stretch marks will fade after delivery. stretch marks affect the surface under the skin and are usually not preventable. recommendations: be sure that your diet contains enough sources of the nutrients needed for healthy skin (especially vitamins c and e). apply lotion to your skin to keep it soft and reduce dryness. exercise daily.

chronic health problems such as diabetes or high blood pressure are more common in women in their 30s and 40s. be sure to get these conditions under control before you become pregnant since they pose risks to both you and your baby. careful medical monitoring begun before conception and continued throughout your pregnancy can reduce the risks associated with these conditions. high blood pressure and diabetes can develop for the first time during pregnancy and women over the age of 30 are at increased risk. if you are pregnant and over age 35 this makes it especially important that you get early and regular prenatal care to ensure early diagnosis and proper treatment. stillbirth (delivery of a baby that has died before birth) is more common in women over age 35. older women are also more likely to have low-birth weight babies (weighing less than 5. 5 pounds at birth). cesarean birth is also slightly more common for women having their first child after age 35.
its not worth taking so much risk at this age if you have symptoms right now. keep regular follow ups with the doctor. if the hole size increases at any stage then you can think of this procedure
most helpful answer i'm sorry you're going through this. it sounds frightening! i'd advise you to seek medical attention as soon as possible. any time a person has heart-related symptoms it's a good idea to get checked out by a doctor. while serious heart conditions aren't very common in people your age it's still a good idea to have the situation evaluated. your health care provider probably will want to run a series of tests including a blood test to check things like your hormone levels and overall blood count. he or she also may run other tests such as an electrocardiogram (ekg) or even a holter monitor which is portable ekg device. anxiety can produce symptoms similar to what you're describing too. however do not try to self-diagnose this. your health care provider will be able to figure out what's causing your symptoms and how to treat them (if at all). good luck to you!

preventing type 1 diabetes currently there is no way to prevent type 1 diabetes but ongoing studies are exploring ways to prevent diabetes in those who are most likely to develop it. people who have a parent brother or sister with type 1 diabetes and are willing to participate in one of these studies should talk with their doctors. they may want to be tested for islet cell antibodies because if they have these antibodies they are more likely to get diabetes. vaccines have not been found to contribute to the development of type 1 diabetes. 4 children who are at risk for developing diabetes still need to get the recommended immunizations. see the childhood immunization schedule recommended by the u. s. advisory committee on immunization practices the american academy of pediatrics and the american academy of family physicians. preventing diabetes complications people with type 1 diabetes can help prevent or delay the development of complications such as eye kidney heart blood vessel and nerve diseases by keeping their blood sugar near normal levels. they also need regular medical checkups to detect early signs of complications. if complications are treated early the damage may be stopped slowed or possibly reversed. people who have other health problems along with diabetes such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol need to treat those conditions. also not smoking can reduce the risk of complications. having other health problems can increase the risk for complications from diabetes. preventing flu and pneumococcal disease people who have diabetes should have a flu shot every year and a pneumococcal vaccine. usually people need only one dose of the pneumococcal vaccine. but doctors sometimes recommend a second dose for some people especially if they have a long-term disease. talk with your doctor about whether you need a second dose. the pneumococcal vaccine helps prevent infections caused by pneumococcal bacteria. people with diabetes especially those who have heart or kidney disease are at high risk for complications hospitalization and death from flu and pneumococcal disease. 5 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

skin damage that is secondary to environmental changes  such as from the sun or harsh weather conditions  can be treated with topical tretinoin alpha-hydroxy acid (aha) or glycolic acid and hydrating compounds. severe conditions will dehydrate your skin cells and rob your skin of essential nutritional elements. in order to combat theses unwanted changes your skin care regimen should be designed to rejuvenate rehydrate and stimulate new healthy skin growth.

home treatments may not cure hpv and genital warts. but a doctor may prescribe medicine that you can use at home such as podofilox lotion or gel or imiquimod cream. caution: do not use nonprescription wart removal products to treat genital warts. these products are not intended for the genital area and may cause serious burning. you can use at-home care to feel more comfortable. 9 take sitz baths. fill a tub with a few inches of warm water and sit in it for 10 or 15 minutes every day. squeeze warm water from a bottle over your genital area to provide comfort and cleansing. use a heat lamp or a hair dryer several times a day to dry your genital area. make sure to hold the lamp or dryer at least 18 inches from your skin. it is important to remember that most infections are minor without serious complications. some cases of hpv and genital warts disappear without treatment although human papillomavirus (hpv) may still be present in your body's cells. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

it appears that you do need medication or insulin since you appear to have diabetes. you need to see your medical provider or a diabetic specialist and get this into control. you will also need to follow a diabetic diet.
"no these are all basically worthless ""quack"" gimmicks. don't waste your time or money. pheromones are real but as far as i know human pheromones have not been successfully tested for efficacy. you really can't spray an expensive substance on your skin and expect the others to be magically attracted to you and offer themselves for unbridled sex. while subtle smells are important a potential partner will likely be more attracted to a nice smile and a pleasant personality not how you smell. human pheromones are in sweat but i don't suggest that you try to attract someone with stinky body odor. ion and power bracelets are absolutely worthless. period. there are no pills or vitamins that will increase the size of your penis. your penis reaches it maximum size by age 17 and there is no substance that can make your penis feet or hands bigger. many men feel their penises are smaller but in controlled studies of zillions of men the size of the penis (when erect) does not vary that much. devices like hanging weights on this delicate member that claim the penis can be enlarged do not work and are potentially dangerous. sexual performance is an art and the most skilled artists do not use large paintbrushes or rollers. the most important sex organ is your brain. enlargement pills do not work. the only thing i have heard that helps with size is a penis pump. just be careful though. these are pretty rough on the penis skin. it's best to use a penis skin moisturizer while using one. man1 man oil is an excellent creme. you can get it online. good luck."
no prescription (antibiotic) eye drops will not cause a change in blood pressure. many things can elevate the blood pressure however so if your readings are higher you will need to see your medical provider. a change in bp meds or and adjustment in dosage is sometimes necessary. i am not familiar with your other two medications - nevanac or durezol  so it would be best to check with the medical provider who prescribed them or your pharmacist. most topical eye medications are not going to cause systemic effects such as raising your blood pressure.

in the vast majority of people smoking is the cause of emphysema. exactly how smoking destroys the air sac linings in the lungs isn't known. however studies show that smokers are about six times more likely to develop emphysema than nonsmokers. estimates vary but more than 10 million people in the u. s. likely have emphysema or another form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the fourth-leading cause of death in the country. interestingly most heavy smokers do not develop emphysema. why some smokers get emphysema and others do not is unknown. all heavy smokers experience other negative health effects of smoking though.
"triamcinalone is not a treatment for jock itch. jock itch is typically tinea cruris a fungal infection. two problems: triamcinalone can make fungus worse and triamcinalone should not be used in the groin area. this is a steroid cream that can actually be absorbed by the body and cause immune suppression over long term use. you are treating this problem entirely wrong if you are self-diagnosing and self-treating. you must have an accurate dermatological diagnosis. this is not something you can get blindly over the internet so if your dermatologist was correct than you should have been treated with an antifungal. i am not sure what he meant by ""related to jock itch"" so you may need to call him/her to discuss your failure to improve assuming he was the one who prescribed the triamcinalone cream."

"antidepressants, particularly the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris), are widely used to treat and prevent a variety of anxiety disorders. antihistamines and beta-blockers can help mild cases of anxiety as well as performance anxiety, a type of social anxiety disorder. certain anticonvulsant medicines, such as gabapentin (neurontin) and pregabalin (lyrica), are also beginning to show value in treating some forms of anxiety in initial research studies."
there are more things that can cause neck/back pain than scoliosis so i would suggest that you see a medical provider (orthopedist) for a consultation and higher-level examination. neck pain is usually not solely related to scoliosis. having a comfortable bed is always good no matter what the reason for you back pain but you would have to try various mattresses and pillows to find the best combination for you. what works for one person will not likely work for another.
"experts from the joslin diabetes center issued guidelines directed at those with type 2 diabetes who are overweight or obese  about 80% of those with type 2 diabetes. those guidelines suggest fewer carbohydrates and a slight boost in protein. about 40% of calories from carbohydrates. about 30% from protein. about 30% from fat. fewer carbohydrates and slightly more protein helps people with type 2 diabetes drop unhealthy weight and control their diabetes says osama hamdy md phd medical director of the obesity clinic and program joslin diabetes center boston.

this could be a blocked gland called a milia cyst  these are very deep and you should not try to extract them yourself. it could also be a wart or a skin tag which is a benign growth of skin that is usually genetically related. common things being common it is one of these; however certain types of skin cancer especially basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma can also occur in this area and for this reason the lesion should be evaluated by your dermatologist since early treatment often leads to a very small scar and complete clearance of the skin cancer.

obviously you will have some complications of the chemical substance you have drunk. mucosa of upper gastrointestinal and respiratory tract is more sensible to react against chemicals than the stomach. also you have protected your stomach somehow by using allegra (fexofenadine) pantos (pantoprazole) and sucralfate. now i would recommend you to consult an ent specialist to check your throat and ear tubes. i suggest you take allegra dexamethasone 4 mg twice daily and if your ears or nose feels blocked then xylometazoline by nasal drops. consult your doctor discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. you would better consult an ent doctor and a gastroenterologist as soon as possible for further information consult an internal medicine physician online  
i'd be very concerned about ephedra or ma huang. that's the other name that can be found on the label of all these over-the-counter products used for weight loss. this has actually been banned by the fda and there was actually a study done by the national institutes of health that showed that people had rises in blood pressure had strokes even died. so you want to be very very careful and i would honestly not take any product that contains this. cardiovascular health is really important. even if you have a history of even a rise in blood pressure just a little bit and you are on high blood pressure medications it's not worth taking that risk. if you have any questions that you aren't sure or need help reading the label come on over to the pharmacy ask for the pharmacists we'll be more than happy to help you.

"if you have low bone density or osteoporosis you can still make pilates a part of your regular exercise program. however you should avoid or modify certain movements to prevent too much stress on your spine ribs and hips. it's important to work with an instructor who is knowledgeable about osteoporosis to develop a program that is safe and appropriate for your individual needs. here are some tips: avoid flexion of the spine many movements in pilates involve flexion or bending which causes the back to round into a c-curve. forward flexion brings the head and shoulders closer to the abdomen. people with osteoporosis or low bone density should avoid or modify movements with flexion. the most common pilates exercise that involves forward flexion is called ""the hundred. "" the position of the head neck and back are not safe if you have low bone density or osteoporosis. other exercises that involve flexion or bending include ab prep and scissors. you can modify these movements by keeping your head down. this will actually make these exercises more challenging. you should not feel pain in your lower back. only do what you are comfortable with. if you have low bone density or osteoporosis you should avoid pilates movements that involve flexion of the spine and cannot be modified. some of the exercises to avoid include: roll up rolling like a ball seal criss cross teaser roll over shoulder stand saw spine stretch jackknife bicycle boomerang double leg stretch single leg stretch open leg rocker crab corkscrew and neck pull. choose extension exercises people with osteoporosis or low bone density should focus on extension exercises. these include exercises that involve backward bending. some examples are: breast stroke prep one leg kick breast stroke double leg kick swan and swimming. you can put a pillow under your lowest ribs to protect them when lying face down. be careful with exercises that involve side bending and twisting a little side bending and twisting is fine but you should not push yourself to a point of strain. keep these movements small. when bending and twisting it is important to keep your spine as straight as possible. to do this imagine you are standing against a wall with your head middle back and buttocks touching the wall. you should only have a slight curve inward in your lower back. when doing movements with bending and twisting your instructor can help you make sure your form is correct."

diarrhea is a common symptom is usually self limited and usually requires only supportive care rest and clear fluids until it resolves. if the diarrhea persists diagnosis of the cause and further care may be needed. blood in the stool is never normal and should always be evaluated. the blood may be from a bleeding hemorrhoid; however other serious causes of bleeding need to be investigated. colitis is not the only cause of rectal bleeding. other causes include diverticulitis colon polyps anal fissures or cancer. chronic diarrhea can lead to dehydration and if severe enough dehydration may require treatment with fluids. the symptoms of dehydration may include: lightheadedness (dizziness) especially when going from the sitting or lying positions to the upright position. weakness. dry mouth. decreased output of urine. high fever associated with diarrhea may be a warning sign that a significant infection is present and may need evaluation by a health care practitioner and treatment. abdominal pain is not normal and while diarrhea may be associated with mild cramps if a person has moderate or severe abdominal pain he or she should seek medical care.
i can't imagine there is a causative relationship. the yeast in yogurt is different that the yeast that causes (vaginal? ) yeast infections. eating yogurt does not cause vaginitis so it just may be a strange coincidence. as a matter of fact many naturalist recommend eating yogurt as a preventative (personally i don't think that helps either). you can just not eat yogurt if you feel if you are having a rare unproven relationship.
you can see this eruption. i cannot so seeing your dermatologist is the appropriate next step. a description is really not sufficient to make an accurate dermatological diagnosis let alone rule out such obscure things as skin cancer. there can be hundreds of reasons. incidentally it would be highly unusual to have cancer in this area so don't worry too much. just have your dermatologist make this important call.
most importantly start slowly after you check with your doctor. step up gradually to exercising on most days of the week for 30-60 minutes. the choice of exercise doesnt matter. start walking. pick up a new sport or an old one that you liked back in high school. it might take a little experimentation before you find something that you really enjoy. if will power is a problem get other people involved. hire a trainer at the gym. start golfing with a friend. join a group of guys who meet for pick-up games in the park.
"hair loss or baldness may or may not related to your family background and this may be due to many reasons like hormonal changes serious illness scalp infection and mental stress etc. just check out if you had gone through any operations or serious illness. it is better to use natural products which may be a remedy for hair loss and itching also. if you have interest on the natural products better to choose products made of ""argan nuts"" which are especially found in moroccan atlas mountains. the oil's acidity and vitamins are essential for hair and assist in softening nourishing and rehabilitating the hair. you can also find this nuts used for making of shampoo and conditioner which may give better result if three products used in an exact way."
i'm not sure why you believe you're leaking cerebrospinal fluid (csf) from your nose but if you truly are you need to seek immediate medical attention. csf leakage from the nose certainly can occur after trauma such as from a car accident. csf is a colorless fluid that circulates throughout the spinal cord and brain. in fact this fluid actually helps cushion the brain like a shock absorber. a nasal csf leak due to trauma is considered a serious problem because you can get meningitis (inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain) easily. a nasal csf leak can occur due to tears in the tissue surrounding the brain. these tears must be surgically repaired. if you haven't received medical attention for this problem please do so immediately. this type of problem definitely warrants a trip to the emergency room. i hope you feel better after your accident!
oh ouch! thrush is a painful condition so you have my sympathy! i'm assuming you were given a prescription rinse to clear up the infection. meanwhile i'd recommend you eat things that are soft and cold. thick liquids like yogurt or an ice cream shake will probably go down well as will gelatin. i would avoid anything salty or brittle (like crackers certain cereals etc. ). these items not only will hurt going down but can cause micro tears in the delicate tissues of the throat. the good news is the antifungal mouth rinse should clear up the bout of thrush in no time. take care!
some consumers are concerned about the use of thimerosal a mercury-containing preservative in vaccines. since 2001 with the exception of some influenza vaccines (flu) thimerosal has not been used as a preservative in routinely recommended childhood vaccines.
the american heart association says taking up to 3 grams of fish oil daily in supplement form is considered safe. don't take more than that unless you discuss it with your doctor first.
alcohol and a number of drugs legal and illegal can increase the risk of seizures. although a lot of parents might rather avoid the topic it's important to talk about these issues especially if your child has epilepsy. it's true that peer pressure can overwhelm any teenager's good sense but your child may have more restraint than you expect. if he understands that drinking and doing drugs raise his risk of seizures he really may avoid those substances. remember he really doesn't want to have seizures either.
"adrenaline (also called epinephrine) is a hormone your body makes in moments of crisis. it makes the heart beat faster and work harder, increases the flow of blood to the muscles, makes you more alert, and causes other changes to prepare the body to meet an emergency. it is also a chemical messenger in the brain."
there are over-the-counter heel pads you can buy at many pharmacies custom shoe stores and a few large stores like walmart. the best pad would be custom-made for your foot by a podiatrist. sometimes a pad isn't needed but rather surgery to remove the heel spur that is causing the problem.
yes it is possible. endomysial antibodies and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (blood tests for diagnosing celiac disease) are highly reliable in diagnosing celiac disease. an individual with abnormally elevated endomysial and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies has a greater than 95% chance of having celiac disease. anti-gliadin antibodies are less reliable and have a higher rate of false positive tests. there are two recognized reasons for false negative blood tests for celiac disease: patients with deficiency of one type of antibody iga (they are born that way) will have low endomysial antibodies and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies since they are iga-type antibodies. patients who have self-treated themselves with a gluten-free diet for weeks to months before having these tests done can have abnormal blood tests revert to normal.
seventy percent of teens diagnosed when they are younger continue to have symptoms of their adhd that affect their functioning as adolescents. once your son stops taking his medication (concerta) his symptoms will return relatively quickly. unless he has learned other compensatory techniques or has outside help his symptoms will affect both his academic performance in school and his relationships with others. if he is driving he may have more difficulty focusing and with distractibility. teens with untreated adhd tend to have more car accidents and get more speeding tickets. all of this should be explained to him and i would suggest that he go in for a visit to discuss this and his decision to stop his medication with his health care provider. i often use this situation as an opportunity for the teen to learn more about how his adhd affects him and why or whether he need to continue his medication to treat his symptoms.
yes. these two very-different medications are compatible if taken at the same time.
high folic acid may be caused by a diet rich in folic acid which is used in fortified foods and supplements and absorbed at a higher rate than folate found naturally in food. it can also be influenced by a vitamin b12 deficiency which causes folic acid to build up on the blood. so it makes sense to get your b12 levels checked to see if that is contributing to your folic acid levels. for more details on folic acid see this webmd article.
team development activities: you can also be currently interacting and bonding together with your crew as well although it is a enjoyable game. performance: all must work as ateam to pass on the right concept in a family day effort: you work together to pass one to the other on a note. communication: you communicate with one another meaning you must be capable of pay attention to eachother in addition to talking/reaching each other. rewards: if somebody were to-do a small mistake (pronounce or hear a term mistaken) the others of the staff can easily see how one small error can cause a bigger mistake or probable catastrophe.

the first step is to prevent yourself from acting out during anger episodes. while getting angry either do reverse counting from 20 to 0 or deep breathing. after calming down give logical suggestions to yourself against losing temper in that particular situation. log down the events resulting in stress and weekly review them. then think some alternative response from your side to resolve it. practice relaxation exercises like yoga (pranayama). follow steps of sleep hygiene such as avoiding caffeinated drinks. remember that every problem has a solution. you just need to try solving it. for further information consult a psychiatrist online

have you tried a brita filter system (or something similar) pitcher to help with the swamp water? you could flavor the filtered water with lemon or lime cucumber or fresh mint leaves. you could make hot or cold green tea (there are wonderful flavors you could try such as tropical green tea or strawberry green tea found in tea bags). that would be much better than that dyed powder i would suspect (healthwise and flavorwise).
should you be concerned? yes if you are not able to eat without vomiting. you should discuss this with the gi specialist and give your acid reflux treatment a specific timeline. there are many different treatments so perhaps you need a different medication or at some point consider surgery even if it appears to be small. i was digagnosed with hh 3 weeks ago. i have been having trouble swallowin vomiting ans burping for years. i had the endoscopy 3 weeks ago. i too have developed incresed symptoms after that procedure. constipation chestpain and unable to burp although i need to. great pressure builds up. i feel like there is something tied around my neck. i cannot eat meat or anything with real substance. just liquid and soft food like apple sauce. this is horrible. i also feel like my hh has gotten worse since my procedure. i have been in the er and once overnight because i vomited so many times that my blood pressure was all over the board and i was in intense pain (9/10). i have been vomiting way more than i did before the procedure even with omeprazole and otc antacids.
yes any strenuous exercise for a long period will deplete your bodies electrolytes and should be replaced.
without seeing the ultrasound i really couldn't tell you the significance of that small dot. i can tell you that at 2 weeks and four days an ultrasound is usually not sensitive enough to pick up an early pregnancy.

i have no way of blindly diagnosing (or treating) your skin eruption over the internet. you would need to have this itchy rash examined. i am guessing that you feel you have poison oak (or ivy depending on where you live in the world) but again this is something that a medical provider would need to see and examine.
it's very rare if not impossible to get genital herpes any other way than by sexual contact. keep in mind however that many people have genital herpes for years or even decades without knowing it. when they are diagnosed their monogamous partners often assume they were unfaithful which may not be true.
biologic drugs are one type of medicine doctors use to treat moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (ra). they work on your immune system to ease inflammation and damage in your joints.
the rash from strep is called scarletina or scarlet fever. it would be very uncommon in a ten month old and i would definitely confirm this with a culture. this type of rash is bright-red covers the entire body and the child is very very ill. later this rash will peel like a sunburn and can last a week or more. i have no way to examine your child over the internet but i would question the diagnosis. thrush is yeast. not a bacteria and it does not cause a general skin rash (other than a diaper rash). the drug nystatin is unlikely to cause a rash.
some of the adjustments your orthodontist may make to your braces may make your mouth feel sore or uncomfortable. when needed over-the-counter pain relievers like motrin or tylenol can help relieve the pain. if you always experience a lot of pain after your braces are adjusted talk to your orthodontist about it; he or she may be able to make the adjustments a bit differently.
in my opinion this looks like a dermatitis due to the sessions you are getting to remove it. try antihistaminic otc and topical steroids to treat it. does not seem like scar.
some antacids may pass into breast milk. however no evidence exists that indicates that the ingestion of antacids through breast milk causes problems for nursing babies whose mothers use antacids occasionally. it is important that you check with your pharmacist about any possible interactions prior to taking an antacid. without knowing the name of a specific antacid it is difficult to say it is safe.
some states will require insurers to specifically pay for bariatric surgery but that will vary across the country. you'll need to check the plans you're considering buying very carefully to see if the services you need are specifically covered. beyond that it's important to keep in mind that whether surgeries and other treatments are covered are determined by their medical necessity. with regard to limitations you cannot be turned away because you're obese and you cannot be charged more for your health plan either.
whether or not health plans available under the affordable care act will cover second opinions will vary according to the individual insurance plan. there is no mandate under the law requiring insurers to cover second opinions. so if that is important to you be sure to check with the individual carrier before you sign up for a plan. and because insurers may distinguish between the kinds of second opinions they cover (e. g. may cover a consultation with another doctor but not necessarily a round of new expensive diagnostic tests) be sure to be specific.
please don't let her sit in soiled pants all day or other punishments. this can create even more physical or psychological issues. your first step is to see he medical provider to make sure there are no medical reasons for this behavior. how would you feel if she had a urinary tract infection or diabetes or a gastrointestinal disorder? if nothing is found they you can work on behavior approaches. way different than what you are doing. your pediatrician can help or you can see a child psychologist. this problem can and will be solved but it is going to take some patience and understanding on your part and a different behavioral strategy.
if he was the only person you have ever had sex with then you most likely got it from him. are you the only person that he has had sex with? if you both have had partners in the past either one of you could have contracted this virus and passed it on.
hi as your doctor said to go ahead then its ok cant see any real reason why not if you think about it. good luck
the reality is that even with the most aggressive and ambitious wrinkle removal process such as the deep chemical skin peel or co2 laser pores are immune to these soldiers. pore size is genetic. often on the face there are some areas where the pores are very obvious and in other areas they are less obvious. it is accepted that what is possible is to reduce the visibility by good skin hygiene including classic facials.  there are many products that aid the esthetician (skin care specialist) in clearing the pores of debris including oil and dead skin. some people will require facial treatments more often than others. my final word of advice is beware of pricey high-tech treatments that proclaim that they can erase or smooth out pores. there is no magic bullet!
both people with hpv infection and their partners need to be counseled about the risk of spreading hpv and the appearance of the lesions. they should understand that the absence of lesions does not exclude the possibility of transmission and that condoms are not completely effective in preventing the spread of the infection. it is important to note that it is not known whether treatment decreases infectivity. finally female partners of men with genital warts should be reminded of the importance of regular pap smears to screen for cervical cancer and precancerous changes in the cervix since precancerous changes can be treated and reduce a woman's risk of developing cervical cancer. similarly men should be informed of the potential risk of anal cancers although it is not yet been determined how to optimally screen for or manage early anal cancer.

well post traumatic epididymitis can take from a few weeks to a few months to heal completely depending upon extent of injury. exertion can aggravate the condition. consult an urologist and get evaluated and a recent ultrasound can be done. a course of antibiotics can be advised to prevent infection and along with it anti inflammatory painkillers can help in relieving pain. avoid long hours of standing or walking and take sufficient rest. hope this helps. regards.

hi are you taken in to account that we are not all the same and some do take longer to get over things. good luck
"most helpful answer i don't know. i have no way of seeing or examining your penis. your description is just too vague for me or any medical provider to make a blind guess. let alone a diagnosis. as embarrassing as this may be for you the only way to have a definitive answer is to be examined. based on what you stated it would not be likely that you have an std or anything ""serious"". there are many innocent skin lesions that can appear on the skin of the penis including. zits. clearly you are concerned so please get it checked out. theres no way to know for sure without going to a doctor so if you want a definitive answer that is what you need to do. it does sound like you are probably experiencing a simply skin reaction very common on the penis. common skin irritations often respond to a top notch penis nutrient cream (health professionals recommend man1 man oil). look for a cream that includes a natural emollient like shea butter. good luck! the penis skin is very sensitive and is susceptible to all sorts of weird issues. what you want to use is a penis health creme called man1 man oil. it is made just for the penis and treats all sorts of skin issues. spots rashes chafing dryness and more. it's a great product."
there is no sure way to prevent colorectal cancer from returning or showing up in other parts of your body. after you have had it your risk of having it again increases. when it comes back it is called metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer. it often comes back after surgery especially if it was not discovered when it was in an early stage. 2 this does not mean it will come back in your case. everyone is different. initial treatment for colorectal cancer is followed by regular doctor visits and screening to help catch the cancer if it returns. as part of your follow-up visits you may have: physical exams. the frequency of your physical exams depends on your general health and the type of colorectal cancer you had. in general you will see a doctor every 3 to 6 months for 3 years and then once a year after that. colonoscopy to look at the inside of your intestine for new problems. carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) blood test to check whether colorectal cancer has returned. chest x-rays to find out whether cancer has returned to involve your lungs. lab tests such as a complete blood count and chemistry screen to look for evidence of cancer. a computed tomography (ct) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (mri) to look inside your body. a positron emission tomography (pet) scan to look for and check any signs of cancer. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

yes you may be at risk. having same sex anal intercourse without a condom puts you at risk if your partner has hiv. unless you saw his negative test results and knew the test results of all of his past partners (and yours) then you only have his word. hiv can enter the body through micro-tears in the genital and anal area; ejaculation is not relevant. you will need to be tested re-tested and re-tested again.
tetanus is a generalised disease associated with painful sustained muscle spasms all over the body. it never occurs at a specific region of the body. you should not worry. he still may be having some pain in the finger. apply coconut oil and gentlyy massage the finger to release the painful spasms. encourage him to bend the finger slowly.
yes. there should not be a problem.
i am 30 years old and not pregnant either but have been bloated nauseous and burping for two months now. i fill full all the time. my sister started with similar symptons three weeks ago now. something is very strange about this. we thought it could be the winter weather change due to lack of sunlight. i eat a very healthy and bland diet and feel very healthy otherwise. i do not take any drugs not even birth control. my sister thinks we have too much melatonin hormone. she read in a hormone book that we may have high levels in the winter that remain in our gut and cause high acid levels in the stomach thus creating bloating and gas. i thought i may have cysts so i went to the doctor for that but all was fine. we are trying light therapy too so the daytime melatonin is not produced. i am only five days into that.
yes it is silly. an eclipse cannot hurt you or your unborn baby. you are completely safe even without red underwear (do they even come in maternity sizes? ) or a safety pin. i wouldn't recommend staring into the sun during a solar eclipse however. i love to hear about these folk tales and their origins. i bet this one goes back a hundred years perhaps started by a crafty clothing merchant trying to sell off some excess red underwear inventory.
"a medical oncologist is the cancer specialist youll probably see most often. usually, your oncologist will oversee your general care and coordinate treatments with other specialists. your oncologist will also be in charge of chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and immunotherapy. youll likely visit your medical oncologist for long-term, regular checkups."
disability benefits don't have a time limit rather they are based on your eligibility. you don't mention whether you're currently receiving medicare benefits as a result of your disability. however at age 65 you will definitely be eligible for medicare coverage. you can check medicare. gov for more information.
please do not take tylenol ( acetaminophen ) with vicodin (hydrocodone-apap) because vicodin contains tylenol already. it is very easy to exceed the maximum daily limit of acetaminophen by combining these two drugs. and high doses of acetaminophen may lead to liver damage. if the hydrocodone isn't controlling your pain i'd suggest you speak with your health care provider. from a pharmacology standpoint there's no harm in combining ibuprofen with hydrocodone but ibuprofen is a blood thinner. so if you're taking hydrocodone to control post-surgical pain for example your doctor may not want you taking a blood thinner like ibuprofen. also your health care provider may not want you taking ibuprofen based on other medications you currently take your past medical history and many other factors. so in a nutshell i'd suggest you simply put a call in to your provider for guidance on what medications are safe for you to take for pain control. wishing you all the best! vicodin which is a combination of acetaminophen (the active ingredient in tylenol) and hydrocodone. long-term effects on the body from products that contain acetaminophen can lead to severe liver damage and liver failure. gallus detox center is a private inpatient medical detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929.
hi well if its itching like crazy like i remember it does you could try some good olive oil virgin would be best or aloe vera gel both very safe i did my sons back with olive oil when he got sunburnt the other year he could not believe how good it was he's a chef and thinks its only for cooking with and salads. and the aloe vera is great for sunburn and your skin. see how you get on. good luck
see your doctor or better yet. a dermatologist. any changing mole should be carefully examined.
if you had your period - you have no reason to worry. plus it's unlikely that you were ovulating at that time (a week before your period is well after when you'd typically ovulate). it's very unlikely that you pregnant.
your symptoms seem to suggest that you are suffering from allergy. levocet m (levocetirizine and montelukast) is given for the same purpose. it is true that the medicine should be taken for a few months regularly. it has minimal side effects like dryness of mouth drowsiness and daytime sleepiness. it is advised that you take levocet m in the night and avoid driving after taking the medicine. ideally i would like to see your nose using nasendoscopy which is an office procedure. also i would like to know more details about the surgery that was done. if you have the papers then you may please scan the same to me in a query as this will let us diagnose your current condition. for allergies we also suggest nasal spray like metaspray (mometasone) or flomist (fluticasone). consult your specialist doctor discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. these sprays are taken in the morning and in the evening two puffs in each nostril for about two weeks and thereafter the dose is reduced and stopped after a month or two. i advice you to take the following blood test as well serum total ige. this will give an indication about the allergy status and we can investigate further to know which allergens cause allergy in you. for further information consult an ent otolaryngologist online  
hi yes it can be possible for a women to get pregnant from what you have done. take two women one has to have sex on the right day even the right minute to get pregnant the next women can get pregnant from more or less an day of the month its just our balmy nature we have. but remember male sperm is a dangerous stuff should be handled with care or poof your pregnant again. good luck
i also have severe anxiety. i am only 17 so i do not know what a drunk/high feeling is like. however i am familiar with the spaced out sensation. these are factors that contributed to my spaced out feeling: hyperventalating chronic insomnia comorbidity in the anxiety spectrum (adhd in my case) in addition depending on what form of anxiety you have perhaps your worried thoughts are always on your mind and thus prevent you from staying in the moment. this was true for me - i have ocd. i think it would be in your best interest to see a psychiatrist.
if you are a female then yes a urinary tract infection (uti) would be a major consideration. there are other possibilities but you would need to see your medical provider to have a screening urinalysis first.
"viral hemorrhagic fevers refer to a group of illnesses that are caused by several distinct families of viruses. in general the term ""viral hemorrhagic fever"" is used to describe a severe multisystem syndrome (multisystem in that multiple organ systems in the body are affected). characteristically the overall vascular system is damaged and the body's ability to regulate itself is impaired. these symptoms are often accompanied by hemorrhage (bleeding); however the bleeding is itself rarely life-threatening. while some types of hemorrhagic fever viruses can cause relatively mild illnesses many of these viruses cause severe life-threatening disease."

"i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it is indeed very painful. in plain english a superior labral tear is a torn tendon at the top of your shoulder joint where the head of your arm bone meets the ""socket"" of your shoulder. it is not an uncommon problem. eventually the tendon probably will heal on its own. tendons and ligaments tend to heal very slowly because they have poor blood supplies. the bad news is it literally can take months for these tears to heal. in the meantime you want to make sure you don't lose range of motion in your shoulder. you should consult your doctor for specific advice on whether or not you should be doing range-of-motion exercises or not. if possible avoid moving your shoulder in a way that causes pain. basically that movement is aggravating the tear which will make it heal more slowly. ice won't help because the soothing comfort of cold can't reach deeply enough into the shoulder joint. if you're not allergic to ibuprofen you can take that for pain. again sorry you're going through this. wishing you well!"
you really have no use for your uterus at age 53 especially if you are getting your ovaries removed. the uterus will serve no purpose other than becoming a place that can form a cancer. i don't know the details of your case but it would see prudent to remove the uterus at the same time as the ovaries. there are no pros for leaving it in.
one option to consider is a chemical peel. dermatologists that are familiar with chemical peels use a combination of salicylic acid aha and tca to remove the top layer of the skin and encourage new skin growth. chemical peels can be very effective and are less costly than most laser treatments.

hi for a start many things can contribute to anxiety and anxiety symptoms. in some cases these issues may cause anxiety directly. in other cases your anxiety symptoms may simply become worse. either way in order to effectively cure your anxiety you need to make sure you're avoiding anything that may contribute to the development of anxiety symptoms. that's why you need to make sure that you're drinking enough water. dehydration rarely causes anxiety on its own but if you're not drinking enough water you may be putting yourself at risk for worse anxiety symptoms now and the development of greater anxiety in the future. part of curing anxiety is making sure that you're taking the right steps towards stopping everything that contributes to further anxiety. drinking water is a great example. so its best you do stay hydrated. i do hope this helps you. good luck
no that would not be considered normal. people who use catheters are very prone to urinary tract infections so it would be wise for your father to get this urinary pain properly evaluated by his medical provider.

one of my favorite dishes is white bean stew with beef or lamb garlic and sage. it includes the simplest of ingredients and preparation but is so satisfying. if you have access to white cannellini beans (canned or in a jar) at your store that is my favorite type of white bean to use. if not you can use a white navy bean. beans are one of the few items out of a can that i fully encourage to use. most of us dont have time to make beans from their dried form. having extra cans in the pantry allows for a weeknight dinner in less than 20 minutes of cook time and about five minutes of prep time. first you will want to get beef lamb or pork and cut into two-inch chunks. (you can buy stew meat or a more tender piece of meat like the loin). if you use a stew meat note that the meat will have a chewier texture than if you were to make a dish that you slow cook for hours. for me i dont mind this texture for the time i save. you will need a pot that can hold two cans of beans and about one pound of meat. first salt and pepper your meat. heat a bit of extra virgin olive oil in the pan and brown your meat. at this point you can add fresh chopped garlic (about a tablespoon) and sage (about a tablespoon). you can substitute rosemary or thyme or do a combination of the three. add firmer vegetables like potatoes and carrots after the meat. from there you will add your rinsed beans and a 1/2 cup of broth or water. you can get creative with what type of veggie you want to add. i like to take a head of dinosaur kale and cut it into one-inch strips or a few cups of baby spinach and add this at the end. small cut-up carrots and or celery works as well. cook everything together for 15-20 minutes over medium heat. if you are using kale or spinach add it in about five minutes before you are done with cooking time. you are then ready for a quick healthy and delicious comfort meal.

i'm sorry to hear you're dealing with this. as a plastic and reconstructive surgery nurse i've worked with many hidradenitis patients so i understand how painful and embarrassing it can be. i'm afraid in general i don't have good news for you. hidradenitis suppurativa is a difficult insidious disease. it basically is an infection of the apocrine sweat glands and only occurs where these glands are located in the skin: the armpits groin perineal area perianal area and areola (area around the nipple). hidradenitis in not curable. in general patients go through mild outbreaks that are treated with antibiotics or other therapies. in my experience hidradenitis almost always recurs however. the only permanent solution to the problem is surgery. surgery is usually reserved for intractable cases where the lesions won't heal and stay open and oozing for weeks or even months. i'm not sure what your doctor is planning to inject you with. botox (botulinum toxin) is not indicated for hidradenitis and there's no evidence it would be useful. botox is used to treat excessive sweating which is called hyperhidrosis. it's possible your doctor is planning to inject corticosteroids into the lesions because this is a fairly common treatment when the disease is in the milder stage. in general hidradenitis patients should focus on keeping the apocrine gland areas very clean with gentle daily washing using an antibacterial cleanser and cleansing only with bare fingers. it's helpful to avoid any sort of skin trauma in susceptible areas and even washing with a washcloth can possibly trigger an outbreak. i wish you all the best with this condition.
"normally, the electrical impulse provided by the bundle branch travels down both the right and left bundle branches at the same speed and the ventricles contract at the same time. if there is a block in one of the branches, it's called a bundle branch block. a bundle branch block causes one ventricle to contract just after the other ventricle, reducing the overall efficiency of contraction."
while there are no significant direct interactions between the two medications you should know that adipex can cause side effects similar to anxiety like rapid heart rate increased blood pressure and jitteriness. if you take xanax to manage anxiety you may have more difficulty managing your condition on adipex. talk to your health-care professional to be sure adipex is right for you.

this does depend on the patient. some of my elderly patients they may last a little longer because they are slowing down a little bit. so their body systems like their kidney and their liver are not working as well. so they may have an effect that's a little bit longer as compared to you or me.
yes. of course. your doctor knows you and your history and can review your imaging studies and thoroughly examine you to determine if there is a relationship to your new symptoms. there can be lots of different reasons to account for these symptoms so it may or may not be associated with your herniated disc.
tattoo removal has come a very long way and we have advances in our lasers to help remove tattoos of all different colors. typically the longer the tattoo and if it's a simple black tattoo those are the easiest to remove. once you get into the red and the yellow and the green colors it's a little bit more complicate and sometimes we can't entirely remove it and certainly not without leaving a mark behind. so the risk is that it takes multiple treatments. sometimes 10-20 treatments. the treatments can be painful and it can get costly and there's still a risk of having a scar left behind. so if you really don't hate the tattoo i would recommend trying to learn to love it but if you really do want to have it removed i would find a dermatologist that specializes in tattoo removal. you can do this by going to the american academy of dermatology website or the american society of dermatologic surgery website and look for doctors that specialize in those treatments.
glutathione (gsh) is a tripeptide meaning a large protein made up of several amino acids. it functions as an antioxidant protecting cells from free radicals and peroxides. raising ones gsh levels through direct supplementation of glutathione is difficult. research suggests that glutathione taken orally is not well-absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract. if you feel that you need this to supplement your immune system speak to your health care provider first.
generally speaking yes it's covered under medicare part d prescription drug plans. however you'll likely be required to meet a set of criteria in order for your plan to cover the medication. i suggest you call your part d drug plan directly to learn what those criteria are. you may also need to involve your physician to get his or her help in justifying the medical necessity of the medication's use.
yes diabetics tend to be immunocompromised and prone to just about any infection including ear infections. with the proper diagnosis and treatment regime diabetics will improve just like the non-diabetics. it would not be possible to predict how long an infection would last since i do not know the details (type of infection treatment regime diabetic control etc. ).
large cysts and solid masses are usually removed surgically because:pain and risk of infection associated with ovarian torsion cysts may leak with the leaked fluid causing pain so large cysts with demonstrable leaked fluid in the abdomen may require surgery solid masses are never normal and require surgical exploration a large ovarian mass will pull on pelvic ligaments and make it likely that the ovary will become twisted (called torsion) â which is very painful. other than the normal process of recovering from surgery removing a cyst while leaving the ovary intact should cause no noticeable effect.
one thing that is important in any aneurysm is to watch blood pressure. when you do exercise like heavy weight lifting the bp may tend to rise steeply due to holding of breath. so please control your bp all the time.
i would not add any more medications on your regimen without consulting your health-care professional and getting the condition looked at. it is important to make sure we understand why you are experiencing the symptoms and treat it appropriately rather than just covering up with medication that isnt working. if your primary care office cannot fix the issue consult a gi specialist.
the treatment of oa focuses on decreasing pain and improving joint movement. the following treatments are available. over-the-counter pain-relieving medications: these include acetaminophen (tylenol for example) aspirin ibuprofen (advil and motrin) or naproxen (aleve). the antidepressant cymbalta (duloxetine) has been approved for osteoarthritis pain as well. some medications in the form of creams rubs or sprays may be applied over the skin of affected areas to relieve pain. synvisc synvisc-one supartz and hyalgan: these medications can be given as injections to relieve pain in some people with osteoarthritis. narcotics: stronger pain pills such as narcotics may be prescribed when osteoarthritis pain is severe and other treatments are not working. joint protection devices: these can prevent strain or stress on painful joints. hot or cold compresses: these treatments may be given in the form of a hot shower or bath or by applying heating pads or cold compresses. surgery: when other treatment options have failed some people may need surgery to relieve chronic pain in damaged joints.  weight control: losing weight can prevent extra stress on weight-bearing joints.  exercise: physical activity can improve joint movement and strengthen the muscles that surround the joints. gentle exercises such as swimming or walking on flat surfaces are recommended because they create less stress on joints. activities that increase joint pain (jogging high-impact aerobics etc. ) should be avoided. if you have arthritis talk to your doctor to find out the best exercise routine for you.  alternative therapy: acupuncture and bioelectric therapy may be able to provide some pain relief. some medical research has shown that the supplements glucosamine and chondroitin may relieve some pain in some people with osteoarthritis especially in the knee. some people also use methylsulfonylmethane (msm) for arthritis but there is less evidence showing its benefits. msm is a naturally occurring sulfur that is taken as a dietary supplement.
"by the latin name of ""contagiosum"" you can assume that it is contagious by direct skin contact. as long as you both are having direct skin contact you can bounce these annoying skin lesions back and forth to each other. if you are both being treated then there should not be an issue. once they are gone on both of you you are considered ""cured"". i do not use otc compound w on molluscum. i use a product called cantharidin (not available over the counter) in my office or freeze them with liquid nitrogen. there are other treatments as well but very few ""good"" treatments over-the-counter."
at this time drugs are rarely tested for safety in pregnant women for fear of harming the unborn baby. until this changes pregnancy exposure registries help doctors and researchers learn how medicines affect pregnant mothers and their growing baby. a pregnancy exposure registry is a study that enrolls pregnant women who are using a certain medicine. the women sign up for the study while pregnant and are followed for a certain length of time after the baby is born. researchers compare babies with mothers who used the medicine while pregnant to babies with mothers who did not use the medicine. this type of study compares large groups of pregnant mothers and babies to look for medicine effects. a woman and her doctor can use registry results to make more informed choices about using medicine while pregnant. if you are pregnant and are using a medicine or were using one when you got pregnant check to see if there is a pregnancy exposure registry for that medicine. the food and drug administration has a list of pregnancy exposure registries ( that pregnant women can join.

"low blood pressure can be a serious and life-threatening problem. is her blood pressure normally a lot higher than this? if so, then i would suggest urgent evaluation by a physician. infections can lead to a response called sepsis, and part of this may include a drop in blood pressure, which can be dangerous to her organs. ensuring adequate hydration is important, as dehydration can cause low blood pressure as well. if she is acting confused, fatigued, or more tired than usual then i would suggest urgent medical evaluation. i hope she feels better."
it's hard to tell what might be going on without more information. for example if you use any type of hormonal birth control (pill intrauterine device) this can influence your cycle. also if your periods occasionally have been irregular in the past this could just be part of the pattern for you. even if your periods have been very regular it's still not unusual for any healthy woman to experience some variance in her cycle. are you by any chance athletic? are you very lean (have low body fat)? do you have an eating disorder that causes you to be very thin? any of these things can cause you to stop having periods. if you're not having any other symptoms such as fever pelvic pain or anything like that then my suggestion would be to wait it out. if your period doesn't come after a couple of weeks you can make an appointment with a gynecologist for a check-up just to make sure nothing abnormal is going on. hope this helps!

this is a popular question that i get at the pharmacy. typically the topical hydrocortisone products are very effective to use as long as the skin isn't broken or bleeding. if the itching is really bothersome an antihistamine like benadryl or zyrtec may be appropriate as well. be sure to have your medication list handy when you are talking to the pharmacist and let us know any other over-the-counter products you may have tried already too so we can help make the best decision.
sorry to hear your little one is going through this. has your child finished the full course of antibiotics? be sure to give her every pill in the bottle according to the dosing schedule on the label. this is critically important in treating infections. if the situation has not improved within a couple of days after you finish the entire course of antibiotics you might take your daughter back to the pediatrician for a re-evaluation. there's no point in going back before the antibiotics are finished unless your child develops new symptoms such as a fever vomiting or things like that. your daughter's hematocrit level appears to be normal for her age by the way. hematocrit measures the volume of red blood cells in relation to total blood volume. i wish you all the best with this and hope your daughter feels better soon!
"black eyes may or may not be associated with a concussion. a blunt injury to the forehead resulting in a ""bump"" is really an accumulation of blood under the skin. because of gravity and the fact that we walk upright this accumulated pocket of blood can gradually drain downward toward the eyelids and upper face and give a person black eyes."
prostate cancer is diagnosed from the results of a biopsy of the prostate gland. if the digital rectal exam of the prostate or the psa blood test is abnormal a prostate cancer is suspected. a biopsy of the prostate is usually then recommended. the biopsy is done from the rectum (trans-rectally) and is guided by ultrasound images of the area. a small piece of prostate tissue is withdrawn through a cutting needle. the trus-guided tru-cut biopsy is currently the standard method to diagnose prostate cancer. although initially a 6-core set was the standard currently most experts advocate sampling a minimum of 10 to 12 pieces of the prostate to improve the chances of detection of the cancer and also to provide a better idea regarding the extent and areas of involvement within the prostate. multiple pieces are taken by sampling the base apex and mid gland on each side of the gland. more cores may be sampled to increase the yield especially in larger glands. a pathologist a specialist physician who analyzes tissue samples under a microscope then examines the pieces under the microscope to assess the type of cancer present in the prostate and the extent of involvement of the prostate with the tumor. one also can get an idea about the areas of the prostate that are involved by the tumor by assessing which of the pieces contain the cancer and which of them do not. another very important assessment that the pathologist makes form the specimen is the grade (gleason's score) of the tumor. this indicates how different the cancer cells are from normal prostate tissue. grade gives an indication of how fast a cancer is likely to grow and has very important implications on the treatment plan and the chances of cure after treatment. a gleason score of six is supposed to indicate low-grade (less aggressive) disease while that of eight to 10 demonstrates high grade (more aggressive) cancer; seven is regarded as somewhere in between these two.

proper skin care is your first approach towards large facial pores. pores appear enlarged when they are clogged dilated or infected and that's why the best way to keep your pores small and less visible is to keep your skin clean all the time. often the pores get clogged with dead skin cells dirt and oil which makes them appear more prominent. thats why regular skin exfoliation is essential in order to remove the dead skin cells and to allow your skin to produce newer healthier cells.
and a simple one to answer. our blood circulation system consists of arteries which carry oxygen-rich blood to the tissues and veins which return oxygen-depleted blood back to the heart and lungs. oxygen-rich blood tends to look bright red. blood carrying less oxygen tends to look dark red. veins carry dark red blood. the reason your veins look bluish is because they lie under skin and fatty tissue which distorts the color of the blood to our eyes. the blood in those veins is indeed red but because of the overlying tissue the veins appear bluish. i hope this answers your question!
"first the vast majority of people who think they have ""the flu"" (influenza) do not and not all viral infections are the same. non-medical people often call any illness associated with fever or body aches as the flu. children can spread influenza (true lab diagnosed influenza) for about a week. several days longer than adults. adults and children can also be contagious a day before they develop influenza. tamiflu does reduce viral shedding if taking early. in the first 2 days. schools and day-care facilities tend to make up their own rules often without any medical consultation. allowing a child to return to school 24 hours after a fever has resolved is not a valid parameter for all illnesses including the flu. children should return to school when they are well not just fever-free. "
i can only suggest a netty pot and saline rinse a few times a day. my children fortunately do not have the same issues as your son but i have found the nyquil or nyquil related products make them very hyper. apparently nyquil has some ingredient in the same family as codeine and the hyperness can be a codeine raction. this was told to me by a nurse and seems to have held true. also check with your pediatrician or other health cre provider about tylenol. my children have been given tylenol products but do not seem to benefit from them. these products never gave them any fever relief. it was recommended to us we alternate advil and motrin for fevers. but again be sure to check with your healthcare provider because of his other issues. good luck

actually the answer is a bit complicated. high cholesterol and diabetes are independent risk factors for heart disease. some people may have one or the other. but many people have both and they do appear to be related. scientists are studying the effects that high blood sugars and insulin resistance have on the different types of fats in the blood. insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas. it helps the cells in the body take up and use glucose for energy. in diabetes the cells become resistant to the effects of insulin. glucose then builds up in the blood. the more resistant the cells are to insulin the higher the triglycerides and ldl (or bad cholesterol) levels become. at the same time the hdl (or good cholesterol) levels fall. but the good news is that both diabetes and high cholesterol can respond to the same healthy lifestyle changes. talk to your doctor about positive changes that you can make in your diet and exercise habits that can put you back on the road to good health. webmd is a great source of information about diabetes and about high cholesterol. here are two links to get you started.   you may also want to talk to a diabetes educator or nutritionist. they can help create a diet plan that is right for you.

hepatitis b is spread mainly by exposure to infected blood or body secretions. in infected individuals the virus can be found in the blood semen vaginal discharge breast milk and saliva. hepatitis b is not spread through food water or by casual contact. in the united states sexual contact is the most common means of transmission followed by using contaminated needles for injecting illicit drugs tattooing body piercing or acupuncture. additionally hepatitis b can be transmitted through sharing toothbrushes and razors contaminated with infected fluids or blood. hepatitis b also may be spread from infected mothers to their babies at birth (so-called 'vertical' transmission). this is the most prevalent means of transmission in regions of the world where hepatitis b rates are high. the rate of transmission of hepatitis b from mother to newborn is very high and almost all infected infants will develop chronic hepatitis b. fortunately transmission can be significantly reduced through immunoprophylaxis. rarely hepatitis b can be transmitted through transfused blood products donated livers and other organs. however blood and organ donors are routinely screened for hepatitis which typically prevents this type of transmission.

choosing a treatment option involves the patient his family and one or more doctors. they will need to consider the grade and stage of the cancer the man's age and health and his values and feelings about the potential benefits and harm of each treatment option. since both surgery and radiation therapy are options for localized disease consultation with both a urologist and a radiation oncologist is recommended. often it is useful to seek additional opinions  from the same type of doctor an internist a family practice physician or a medical oncologist. because there are several reasonable options for most patients patients may hear different opinions and recommendations and the decision can be difficult. however patients should try to get as much information as possible and allow themselves enough time to make a decision. there is rarely a need to make a decision without taking time to discuss and understand the pros and cons of the various approaches.

it really isn't just about what foods to eat but how you regulate your food intake. foods low in calories but high in nutrition can help such as fruits vegetables low fat dairy whole grains and lean meats. but if you skip meals or don't pay attention while eating you can end up eating too much or too little. so i usually start by recommending people start with how they eat  structure regular meals stay at the table when eating and stop when getting full. then add in healthy foods into those meals. for more on what and how to eat see these articles: eat healthy to lose weight how to practice mindful eating

many people don't realize infants have a faster heart rate than adults. a lot of people think a baby's heart rate should be slower than an adult's because a baby is so much smaller but actually the opposite is true. a normal infant (age 1 to 12 months) heart rate is between 80 and 140 beats per minute. as your baby gets older his or her pulse rate will gradually slow down. a normal adult heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. whenever you have questions about your baby's vital signs you can always check with your pediatrician. these are great questions to ask and can help you better assess physical changes in your baby when he or she is sick. wishing you well!

assuming you're not allergic to ibuprofen the answer is yes. by all means take some for the pain of strep throat. ugh! ibuprofen doesn't interact with antibiotics so it's ok to take everything at the same time (if you also were given oral antibiotics). if you are an adult you should not take more than 2400mg of ibuprofen in a 24-hour period. you can divide that up in different ways but you should never take more than 800mg of ibuprofen at a time. children's dosing for ibuprofen is significantly different from adult dosing. if you weigh less than 95 pounds you should consult a pharmacist for directions on how to take ibuprofen. wishing you well!

"the first and most important step is to have these ""red bumps"" properly diagnosed by a medical professional such as a dermatologist. it would not be possible for me or any medical provider to be able to blindly determine exactly what these red bumps might be over the internet. making a dermatological diagnosis is very visual. treatment would depend on your diagnosis which is not known. weirdly enough one of the best rash medicines is for athletes foot. a nurse recommended it for diaper rash for my baby because its cheaper than baby rash meds and works better. another help if the symptoms are bothersome is natural yogurt. it replaces nutrients naturally. both work great."

the true nature of this mysterious raised area cannot be determined without a careful examination hopefully at a time when it is evident to the medical examiner. your description is just not sufficient to make a blind guess so you will need to wait for your upcoming gynecological appointment or better yet get a sooner appointment while this abnormality is present. this is really the only way to know.
patients with celiac disease are at risk for some nutritional deficiencies including folate deficiency b12 deficiency and iron deficiency. celiac disease patients are also at risk of developing low bone mineral density (osteoporosis). there are two reasons for nutritional deficiencies in celiac disease patients: the diseased small intestine causes a lack of absorption of vitamins and nutrients. strict gluten restriction can also lead to nutritional deficiencies. many of the gluten-free foods are not fortified or enriched with vitamins or minerals. studies have also shown that gluten-free products are often low in b vitamins calcium vitamin d iron zinc magnesium and fiber. fortunately there are blood tests that your physician can do to determine if you are deficient in any nutrients. it's important to be aware of what deficiencies you are at risk for and to make every effort to avoid these deficiencies. the deficiency in nutrients does not mean a deficiency in calories. there is an increased incidence of obesity in persons with celiac disease who are following a gluten-free diet. the dietary goal is to follow a well-balanced diet with appropriate supplements when needed and an adequate amount of calories for maintaining a healthy weight.

"some people tend to have cases of appendicitis that ""runs in their families"" but the only preventive measures would be dietary. appendicitis is often caused by a clog/plug in this hollow intestinal appendage and often those clogs are seeds sunflower seed shells undigested nuts etc. but many times this clog is a fecalith (a very tiny piece of hard poop! ) and this may be impossible to prevent."
some women are overly-prone to vaginal yeast. i have no way of delving into your medical history in order to find a reason (or reasons) for your recurrences or review your past treatment regimes but i do believe this problem can be solved by the right combination of medications and some extra care with sexual hygiene. your partner could be re-introducing the yeast or your specific sexual practices could be suspect. your medical provider should make sure that you do not have any underlying health issues such as diabetes that could be contributory.

it is possible to go through premature menopause before 40 but only a doctor can say for sure. weight gain especially in the midsection is related to menopause because the ovaries no longer produce estrogen and this changes the way fat is metabolized. hemorrhoids are not commonly associated with menopause and can happen to anyone especially if they are inactive drink little water and consume a diet low in fiber. not getting your periods is a serious manner so i highly recommend you see a doctor to rule out menopause or other health issues that could be going on. don't delay! for more on premature menopause see this webmd article
infected with what? there are many types of stds you did not mention what type that he has. if it is herpes then it is still possible to transmit herpes to your mouth throat or genitals even if he does not have an active outbreak. this will be the risk you will take. your partner should also be thoroughly tested for other stds. consider using condoms and safe sexual practices until he get the okay from all of his tests.
probably not but please ask your dermatologist  someone who uses accutane on a regular basis for patients. over-the counter supplements like creatine were not likely tested against prescription medications like accutane so there is little or no data about interactions. creatine doesn't really do that much as far as muscle building. your exercise regime is the most critical element not your supplements.
"coxsackie virus is a member of the picornaviridae family of viruses in the genus termed enterovirus. coxsackie viruses are subtype members of enterovirus that have a single strand of ribonucleic acid (rna) for its genetic material. the enteroviruses are also referred to as picornaviruses (pico means ""small "" so ""small rna viruses""). coxsackie virus was first isolated from human feces in the town of coxsackie new york in 1948 by g. dalldorf. coxsackie virus is also written as coxsackievirus."

genital herpes is painful. very painful since the herpetic virus involves the nerves in this area. hopefully your medical provider has given you the appropriate anti-herpetic medications as well as something for pain. this may last for a while and genital herpes tends to be recurrent. the anti-herpetic medications will help reduce future outbreaks too.
"angina medications reduce the heart muscle's demand for oxygen in order to compensate for the reduced blood supply and also may partially widen the coronary arteries to enhance blood flow. three commonly used classes of drugs are nitrates beta blockers and calcium blockers. examples of nitrates include isosorbide (isordil) isosorbide mononitrate (imdur) and transdermal nitrate patches. examples of beta blockers include propranolol (inderal) atenolol (tenormin) and metoprolol (lopressor). examples of calcium blockers include nifedipine (procardia adalat) verapamil (calan verelan verelan pm isoptin isoptin sr covera-hs) diltiazem (cardizem dilacor tiazac) and amlodipine (norvasc). many patients benefit from these angina medications and experience reduction of angina during exertion. when significant ischemia still occurs either with ongoing symptoms or with exercise testing coronary arteriography is usually performed often followed by either pci or cabg. patients with unstable angina have severe coronary artery narrowing and often are at imminent risk of a heart attack. in addition to angina medications they are given aspirin and the intravenous blood thinner heparin. a form of heparin enoxaparin (lovenox) may be administered under the skin and has been demonstrated to be as effective as intravenous heparin in patients with unstable angina. aspirin prevents clumping of blood clotting elements called platelets while heparin prevents blood from clotting on the surface of plaques. newer potent iv anti-platelet drugs (""super aspirins"") are also available to help stabilize such patients. while patients with unstable angina may have their symptoms temporarily controlled with these potent medications they are often at risk for heart attacks. for this reason many patients with unstable angina are referred for coronary angiography and possible pci or cabg. pci can produce excellent results in carefully selected patients who may have one or more severely narrowed artery segments which are suitable for balloon dilatation stenting or atherectomy. during pci a local anesthetic is injected into the skin over the artery in the groin or arm. the artery is punctured with a needle and a plastic sheath is placed into the artery. under x-ray guidance (fluoroscopy) a long thin plastic tube called a guiding catheter is advanced through the sheath to the origin of the coronary artery from the aorta. a contrast dye containing iodine is injected through the guiding catheter so that x-ray images of the coronary arteries can be obtained. a small diameter guide wire (0. 014 inches) is threaded through the coronary artery narrowing or blockage. a balloon catheter is then advanced over the guide wire to the site of the obstruction. this balloon is then inflated for about one minute compressing the plaque and enlarging the opening of the coronary artery. balloon inflation pressures may vary from as little as one or two atmospheres of pressure to as much as 20 atmospheres. finally the balloon is deflated and removed from the body. intracoronary stents either self-expand or most commonly they are delivered over a conventional angioplasty balloon. when the balloon is inflated the stent is expanded and deployed and the balloon is removed. the stent remains in place in the artery. atherectomy devices are inserted into the coronary artery over a standard angioplasty guide wire and then activated depending on the device chosen. cabg surgery is performed to relieve angina in patients whose illness has not responded to medications and who are not good candidates for balloon angioplasty. cabg is best performed in patients with multiple blockages in multiple locations or when blockages are located in certain arterial segments that are not well-suited for pci. cabg is often also used in patients who have failed to attain long-term success following one or more pci procedures. cabg surgery has been shown to improve long- term survival in patients with significant narrowing of the left main coronary artery and in patients with significant narrowing in multiple arteries especially in those with decreased heart muscle pump function."

a hysterectomy only removes the uterus. any woman of any age who still has a vagina can most definitely get a vaginal yeast infection especially after being on systemic antibiotics. it is prudent to use the over the counter yeast medication that you have mentioned; the anti-itch medication would only treat the itch not the cause. obviously if you are not improving you will need to consult your medical provider for patient-specific advice.
the water soluble vitamins (b vitamins biotin folic acid pantothenic acid and vitamin c) are not as likely as fat-soluble vitamins to reach toxic levels. this is because excess water soluble vitamins in the body are excreted from the kidneys. there are upper consumption limits for niacin vitamin b6 foliate choline and vitamin c. for more information about water and fat soluble vitamins and their functions visit the webmd article vitamins functions and sources.

osteoporosis is a disease characterized by loss of bone that increases the risk of fracture particularly in the wrist spine and hip. exercise can have a positive effect on bone mineral density and the strength of bone but it is a complicated relationship because of many factors including genetics age gender hormone and menopause status activity level and nutrient deficiencies. age applies to everyone when it comes to the effect of exercise on building bone strength. in youth the time of peak bone mineral content velocity (the time around puberty when bone rapidly forms) is an important time for children and early teens to be exercising because: 1. research shows that increases in estrogen in girls helps bone form (puberty is when estrogen rises) and exercise added during this time enhances the effect on bone density. 2. research shows that active youth have higher bone density than inactive children. 3. research suggests that denser bone formed during childhood may track into adulthood. that is if children and teens exercise enough to create denser bones than their sedentary peers then they may have thicker bones as adults. as for young adults it is generally believed that peak bone density is reached by the time we reach our late 20s or early 30s and research suggests that athletes in this age group have higher bone mineral density than sedentary individuals. for middle-aged and older adults bone density decreases by about 5% per decade after the age of 40. some scientists believe that during these times of life it may not be realistic to expect substantial increases in bone density but rather we should expect a reduction or attenuation of the loss of bone that we experience as we age. these scientists may be right because there is little evidence that walking weight lifting or any other type of exercise substantially increases bone density in older adults. what you can say with some certainty is that active individuals in these age groups do maintain their bone density while their sedentary peers do not. and that's a good thing. equally important for older adults in terms of osteoporosis is the effect of exercise on the risk of falling. when individuals with osteoporosis fall they typically break bones and in fact sometimes the bones are so brittle that they break before the person hits the ground; for example just stepping off a curb could break a brittle bone in the hip and then the individual falls as a result. people fall for many reasons including poor balance poor vision decreased strength and range of motion and cognitive impairments like dementia. exercise can't help every factor but studies show that exercises such as balance training (e. g. tai chi) leg strengthening and flexibility training (e. g. yoga) can reduce the risk of falling in older adults. as for which exercises are best for people with osteoporosis the simple answer is: 1. weight-bearing exercises that cause force on the bones like jogging stair climbing and walking briskly. 2. resistance exercises that involve the bones you are concerned about. 3. balance exercises if you are an older adult. research is clear that you need some force-loading or weight-bearing on bones to have any effect on density and strength but caution should be taken with exercise when you have osteoporosis. you should avoid: 1. exercises that might increase the risk of falling. 2. movements like twisting of the spine and bending from the waist. 3. high-impact activities like high-intensity aerobics or jumping. 4. excessive weight during resistance exercise. the american college of sports medicine recommends the following exercises for bone health for different age groups: for children and teens: type: impact activities such as gymnastics jumping (sometimes called plyometric training) and moderate-intensity resistance training; participation in sports that involve running and jumping like soccer and basketball (although they concede that research to prove this is lacking). intensity: high in terms of bone-loading forces; for safety reasons resistance training should be moderate equivalent to 60% of the maximum lift. frequency: at least three days per week. duration: 10-20 minutes (two times per day or more may be more effective). for adults: type: weight-bearing endurance activities (tennis; stair climbing; jogging at least intermittently during walking) activities that involve jumping (volleyball basketball) and resistance exercise (weight lifting).

a pap smear is a test used to diagnose cervical or vaginal precancerous or cancerous cells. your first pap smear should be performed at the age of 21 regardless of sexual activity. a pap smear cannot diagnose endometriosis. endometriosis is a condition in which cells that typically line the inside of the uterus (endometrial cells) are found outside the uterus where they should not be. for example this endometrial tissue may be found on the outside surface of the uterus ovaries fallopian tubes or anywhere in the pelvic or abdominal cavity. when this tissue is in these abnormal areas it can cause significant pain during your period painful intercourse scarring and potentially infertility. if you are having painful periods you need to see a gynecologist - even if you are a virgin. endometriosis is typically diagnosed based on symptoms; however sometimes your doctor may perform a type of surgery called a laparoscopy where a camera is inserted through your belly button to look for and treat endometriosis. there are several other types of treatment for endometriosis such as oral contraceptives lupron and pain medicines. it is never too early to see a gynecologist if you have any concerns or questions.
no it is not unusual. it would be wise for your spouse to see a medical provider so that the various reasons (there are many) can be investigated. if your spouse is a male (you didn't state your own sex) you may have to drag him to the doctor. men are very very stubborn.
"i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. cracked fingertips can be very painful! if you haven't had this checked out by a medical professional it might be worth having someone take a look just to make sure this isn't a dermatitis or something that could be treated with a prescription medication. assuming this is cracking due to dry skin i would suggest applying a&d ointment to your fingers. you can find this preparation in the diaper rash aisle of any supermarket or drugstore. sometimes it's called ""vitamin a & vitamin d"" ointment because that's what it contains. vitamins a and d are essential to the healing process. you might see good results using this ointment or cream. rubber gloves are great for protecting your hands from harsh chemicals or from the drying effects of too much contact with water. if you choose to try a&d ointment i suggest you get a pair of cotton gloves (such as those used for gardening or light yard work) apply the ointment at bedtime then put on the gloves and go to sleep. the gloves will help keep the ointment where it belongs instead of getting all over the sheets. i wish you all the best with this!"
if you had an ectopic pregnancy then it would show on the sonogram. pregnancy test could be positive due to leftover tissue. as it was removed it should be examined by histopathology test. sometimes hcg (human chorionic gonadotropin) producing trophoblastic tissue (it is similar to a healthy pregnancy tissue) persists inside uterus giving positive pregnancy tests. if your test comes positive then you should do titer of serum beta-hcg every third day to see if it is rising or falling. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online

"the national health and examination survey (nhanes i) showed that people who engage in limited recreational activity were more likely to gain weight than more active people. other studies have shown that people who engage in regular strenuous activity gain less weight than sedentary people. physical activity and exercise help burn calories. the amount of calories burned depends on the type duration and intensity of the activity. it also depends on the weight of the person. a 200-pound person will burn more calories running 1 mile than a 120-pound person because the work of carrying those extra 80 pounds must be factored in. but exercise as a treatment for obesity is most effective when combined with a diet and weight-loss program. exercise alone without dietary changes will have a limited effect on weight because one has to exercise a lot to simply lose one pound. however regular exercise is an important part of a healthy lifestyle to maintain a healthy weight for the long term. another advantage of regular exercise as part of a weight-loss program is a greater loss of body fat versus lean muscle compared to those who diet alone. other benefits of exercise include: improved blood sugar control and increased insulin sensitivity (decreased insulin resistance) reduced triglyceride levels and increased ""good"" hdl cholesterol levels lowered blood pressure a reduction in abdominal fat reduced risk of heart disease. remember these health benefits can occur independently (with or without) achieving weight loss. before starting an exercise program you should talk to your doctor about the type and intensity of the exercise program. general exercise recommendations: 20-30 minutes of moderate exercise 5 to 7 days a week preferably daily. types of exercise include walking stationary bicycling walking or jogging on a treadmill stair climbing machines jogging and swimming. exercise can be broken up into smaller 10-minute sessions. start slowly and progress gradually to avoid injury excessive soreness or fatigue. over time build up to 30 to 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise every day. people are never too old to start exercising. even frail elderly individuals (ages 70-90 years) can improve their strength and balance. exercise precautions: the following people should consult a doctor before vigorous exercise: men over age 40 or women over age 50. individuals with heart or lung disease asthma arthritis or osteoporosis. individuals who experience chest pressure or pain with exertion or who develop fatigue or shortness of breath easily. individuals with conditions or lifestyle factors that increase their risk of developing coronary heart disease such as high blood pressure diabetes cigarette smoking high blood cholesterol or having family members with early onset heart attacks and coronary heart disease. a patient who is obese"

i can't comment on the value of an aarp membership. however if you're not old enough to qualify for medicare and are in the market for a private insurance policy i would recommend you broaden your search by looking for insurance on healthcare. gov. there you'll find a wider range of health plan options than what any one company offers. if you earn too much money to qualify for financial help from the government you would also be well served to search your insurance options outside of the marketplace set up under the affordable care act. you can try a site like ehealthinsurance. com or gohealth. com which offer a wider range of insurance options.

this drug has been used off-label to treat common warts (verruca) but plantar warts are a bit different and very difficult to treat. it is not very likely that this will work on those warts so it is best to see a good podiatrist or dermatologist and have the treated by a different more-effective method.
"the good news is that bright red blood on the surface of your stool or in the toilet water or on the toilet paper usually isn't the type of blood associated with a cancer of the digestive tract. usually bright red blood like that is more associated with hemorrhoids or a minor rectal bleed due to passing hard stool or straining hard during a bowel movement. when we talk about ""blood in the stool"" related to a cancer this blood usually isn't recognizable as blood. it usually turns the stool black or tarry. the pain in your upper-right abdomen could be caused by many conditions including gallstones. because the pain has persisted for over 2 weeks i'd suggest you get it checked out. the pain may or may not be related to the other symptoms you describe. only a medical professional can give you a firm diagnosis. i hope you feel better soon!"

the term addictive disease or addiction describes a persistent habit that is harmful to the person. thus addiction is a chronic disease with reliance on the substance causing the addiction. the addictive substance also causes the accompanying deterioration of a person's physical and psychological health. psychologically an individual's behavior pattern establishes how the addictive substance is used. one type of behavior is compulsive behavior which is an overwhelming and irresistible interest in use of the substance. for example the compulsive addict makes sure that the substance is always available. another type of behavior is habitual behavior which is using the substance regularly or occasionally for the desirable effects. physically continuous use of the substance leads to dependence on the drug by the body. this dependence means that when the drug is discontinued symptoms of withdrawal or distress occur. nicotine is the component of cigarettes that addicts. almost immediately upon inhalation the body responds to the nicotine. an individual feels relaxed calmer and happier than before the inhalation. these pleasant feelings reflect the physical side of addiction; but then doing without cigarettes causes craving for more cigarettes irritability impatience anxiety and other unpleasant symptoms. indeed these symptoms are the symptoms of withdrawal from cigarettes. what's more over time more and more nicotine is desired to produce the favorable effects and to avoid the symptoms of withdrawal.
the rhinovirus (or other cold virus) enters your body through your nose or mouth and is easily spread when you touch someone or touch common objects contaminated with a cold virus (the computer keyboard or mouse the telephone receiver a doorknob or eating utensils). if you aren't cautious about hand washing you can spread the common cold to family friends co-workers and people you've never met at a restaurant or the supermarket. of course if someone with a cold or flu sneezes or coughs around you the virus can spread that way too. while getting chilled or wet is not a cause of common colds there are factors that make you more susceptible to catching a cold virus. for example you are more likely to catch a common cold if you are excessively fatigued have emotional distress or have allergies with nose and throat symptoms.

ask her. don't just assume that her vagina will reveal her recent sexual past while you were not together. did you have some sort of an understanding that she would not date or have sex with others while you were absent? were you celibate for the last three months? if either one of you have had unprotected sex it is std screening that should be your major concern.

my short answer to your question is this: i'd suggest you continue going to the doctor but i'd go to a different doctor. many conditions can take a long time to diagnose. sometimes you have to visit many doctors over the course of years to obtain a diagnosis. so no you should not give up. if you've been seeing a general medicine doctor (like a primary care provider) try finding an internal medicine specialist instead. take a copy of your medical records with you and keep a written log of your symptoms on a daily basis. this data can help reveal patterns in your symptoms that help lead to a diagnosis. i wish you all the best as you persevere in discovering what's causing you to feel so ill all the time.
you should talk to your dentist about this. i do not know what type of night guard you have but there are appliances that can be designed to protect your tissues from your teeth. in addition the rough edges of the teeth can be smoothed out so that they do not damage your mouth. all of this can and should be evaluated by a dental professional.

if pregnancy is the concern then the best way to find out is to get a blood serum beta hcg test done. this is a confirmatory test for pregnancy as the urine pregnancy kits may show false positive results. if the levels of hcg are more than 1 or raised then pregnancy is confirmed. if the level is less than 1 then pregnancy is completely ruled out. if the test is positive then you should undergo an ultrasound pelvis to locate the pregnancy for its site which could be intrauterine or possibly in the tubes (ectopic). if the usg shows extrauterine pregnancy then you would require a laparoscopic salpingectomy to remove the damaged tube along with the ectopic. if the pregnancy is intrauterine then you may decide upon continuing the pregnancy. if the test is negative then the possible cause remains uti (urinary tract infection) or a possible pid (pelvic inflammatory disease) or endometriosis. also stress per se can cause derangement of hormonal balance and can cause heavy bleeding inspite of being on continuous progesterone pills. this can be controlled with antifibrinolytics in the absence of pregnancy. for further follow up consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online  
"i don't know. i can't see them examine you nor do i know anything about you or your medical history. there is no way for me or any medical provider to be able to blindly guess that nature of your ""sores"" based on vague description. if you would like to have a definitive answer. a diagnosis. after a year and a half of worry then i strongly suggest that you see an ent specialist for a high-level examination."

i guess my first question would be why do you want to supplement with vitamin k? vitamin k deficiency is very rare in healthy adults and unnecessarily taking extra vitamin k can cause you to develop a blood clot which could be lethal. i would not recommend taking a vitamin k supplement without medical supervision. i suggest you call or visit your primary health care provider and have a chat about all the supplements you're taking which ones may be right for you and what dosages to take. many physicians nurse practitioners and physician assistants are very knowledgeable about supplements these days and can give you scientific advice. hope this helps!
no. if this person truly has gastric ulcers she should be under the care of a good medical provider and on medications that will work to alleviate her pain and cure the ulcers. i don't know how she was diagnosed or what tests have been run to determine the type and location of her ulcers but perhaps seeing a gastrorenterologist would be advisable. treating something that can be potenitally serious. over-the-counter. is really not the best approach.
i know a lot of people who do and in my opinion i say do it
self-discipline: have a conversation about personal responsibility. as a parent its our inclination to rescue our kids which sometimes means making a special trip up to school to drop off the homework that got left on the kitchen table. but school gives children an opportunity to practice their life skills in a safe environment. let your child forget his homework and let him see the consequence of being disorganized. these are teaching moments. confidence: talk about making good decisions and sticking to them. a child with good self-esteem will to cave to peer pressure. she will lead and not follow. remember those words every exasperated parent has shouted: if everyone else was jumping off of a bridge would you? !  make your child feel good about her reasoning and judgment. then you wont have to worry that she will blindly follow others. exercise: if your child plays a sport exercise time is automatically part of his schedule. but many tweens and teens dont exercise on a regular basis if they arent involved in a team sport. make physical activity part of your childs daily routine. kids spend several hours a day sitting at a desk and then a few hours (or more) sitting down to do their homework. make exercise a priority and a mental health break. set media limits: twitter facebook cell phones text messaging video games tv shows and surfing the web need i go on? as if school homework and after-school activities arent enough electronic communications and screen time can take up the rest of a childs waking hours. make a family plan to spend time together without disruption from a tv or a friend who is calling or texting your child during dinner. turn off the electronics completely or set a curfew for them. sleep: sleep is powerful and underrated. with so many things on your childs plate she may sacrifice sleep to cram for a math test or have a text conversation with her best friend. remind your child how much better she will feel (and how much better she will perform on that math test) if she gets the sleep her body needs. set a reasonable bedtime and try to enforce it as much as possible.
"i'm very sorry to hear about your dad. this must be a difficult time for you and your family. hepatocellular carcinoma as you probably know is liver cancer. sorafenib is a medication (chemotherapy drug) designed to slow the spread of cancer cells. it probably will not cure the cancer but it may help slow down the disease. if your dad or your family has questions about any of the medications the doctor is prescribing you should feel free to make an appointment to discuss the issue. some questions you might want to ask are: what does this medication do? what is the goal of this drug therapy? how should this drug be taken? what are possible side effects of this medication? are there other medications that could be used? if so why are you choosing this particular drug? what happens if the drug does not work as expected? what would the ""next step"" be? sorafenib has produced good results during clinical trials in terms of extending survival rates of people with liver cancer. i am hoping your dad is among the many who benefit from this treatment. i wish you and your family all the best!"
common causes of cough include nasal allergy with post-nasal drip acid reflux and asthma. do you have nasal congestion sneezing and drip? i agree that a trial of antihistamines is helpful. you can consider adding on a sinus rinse and talk to your doctor about a nasal steroid spray to help decrease the drainage. do you experience any heartburn symptoms? do you feel short of breath? i would let your doctor know if you have persistant cough as additional therapies or investigations may be warranted.

"do not change your meds without consulting your prescriber. i am very concerned with many many. folks dropping lowering changing their meds without their doctor's advice. we doctors know you patients do this a lot no matter what our advice. may i suggest that if your med isn't working or is giving you side effects call or make an appointment with your doc. i have at least 20 ways to treat depression with meds and probably 20 antidotes to side effects my meds give you all. as a doc i'd like a call saying ""hey this med is great but i have a side effect what can i do to stay on the med and get my side effects to go away? "" finally if you stop some meds cold turkey you can have anywhere from a mild withdrawal to a seizure and coma with others. in my career i have had to put 2-3 patients in the hospital for medical emergencies due to withdrawal. if they would've called me we could have lowered the meds safely and moved forward."
hormones are drugs that can affect the growth of prostate cancer cells. hormone therapy is sometimes used with radiation treatment or surgery to help make sure that all cancer cells are destroyed. chemotherapy is the use of powerful drugs-either injected or taken as pills-to destroy cancer cells. many men decide to have chemotherapy for treatment of late-stage prostate cancer but researchers are studying whether chemotherapy should be used before or after surgery to treat early-stage high-risk prostate cancer. 11 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

you can use rinses instead of hair dyes or permanent hair dyes and that can be a great start. once your hair crosses a line in terms of percentage of hair that's gray those colors may not look so good they may look brassy or too orange and you may have to crossover to more permanent colors. some people like using henna and that's fine as well. however permanent colors a lot of the products you find over-the-counter are different than the ones that you would find about five or even ten years ago. so these hair dyes are typically considered safe and effective over time. so you do have a broad range of products that you can use from the semipermanent the washout in two or three cycles to the ones that are more permanent to choose from but they are all considered safe.
the mainstay of a diet for menieres is low sodium typically under 2000mg daily. that means focusing on whole foods that naturally have less sodium over processed foods with sodium added. these foods include fruits vegetables whole grains unprocessed meats and healthy fats. when choosing other items read the label. this list should help you figure out low sodium choices. it's also beneficial to limit caffeine in items like coffee tea and soda. these are other foods high in caffeine. i think the cheese and wine has to do with migraines and not menieres so you'll have to check with your doctor on that. i would focus on sodium first. good luck!

unresolved itching is a truly frustrating symptom for all patients to deal with. because this has been going on for some time you might want to get a medical evaluation to make sure you don't have a disease process that is causing the itching. the fact that you have identified stress as a possible trigger tells me that while it may not be the source of your difficulty it certainly could be making it worse. i would recommend that you look into stress reduction methods that are available in your area. some schools and universities offer programs in stress reduction meditation yoga etc. stress is hard on your entire body and could be negatively impacting other health systems as well as making your itching worse. see what you can do about getting a diagnosis and try to learn to manage your stress levels.

"well it certainly sounds like you're doing all the right things to avoid high blood pressure. i salute you! and i want to add: keep doing all those things. our blood pressure tends to fluctuate a little during the day. this is normal. so if you're taking your bp at home and discovering these fluctuations you may not have hypertension at all. granted 140/90 is considered the ""hypertension threshold "" but it's usually concerning only if your pressure is sustained at that level or higher all the time. if for example your blood pressure measures 140/90 immediately after you've been exercising that would be considered a pretty normal finding. everyone's blood pressure rises during exercise  that's part of the point of exercising to get your heart pumping. to your question however many conditions can cause hypertension. kidney problems definitely rank high on the list. adrenal gland tumors also can be the culprit. but i caution you not to jump to any conclusions. the truth is even seemingly healthy people like yourself can develop high blood pressure and we don't know exactly why. this is called ""essential hypertension. "" although it's more common in people with a family history of high blood pressure anyone can wind up with it. if you're concerned about your blood pressure your best bet is to see your medical provider. he or she is in the best position to assess your condition and determine if you have hypertension or not and if so whether or not it needs to be treated. meanwhile keep up the great work! you're an inspiration to the rest of us."

anemia (reduced red blood cell number and/or volume) is more common in patients with longstanding diabetes. this is probably due to the effect of diabetes on the kidney which makes the hormone erythropoietin. erythropoietin stimulates the bone marrow to make red blood cells but this hormone is reduced in patients with moderate or severe diabetic kidney damage resulting in under-stimulated red blood cell production by the marrow. most people with diabetes do not have anemia in the absence of kidney disease. it is easy to test for anemia and kidney disease with simple blood tests that most people with diabetes have had many times. there are many potential causes of anemia including iron deficiency b12 or folic acid deficiency heavy menstrual bleeding ulcer in the stomach or upper intestine colon cancer kidney disease etc. diabetes itself is not really a primary cause.

this will typically depend on your individual body's response as well as the dose of antibiotics taken. hives and itching can last anywhere from a few days to a few weeks in my experience. if you visit your physician they may prescribe prednisone which will relieve the symptoms and likely make the hives go away more quickly.

it would not be wise to self-diagnose yourself as having a secondary bacterial infection from your recent viral illness and self-prescribed ampicillin. it would be advisable for you to be properly examined and diagnosed first by a medical professional. ampicillin is not used very much any more so it is unlikely that even if you did have a bacterial infection this would not be the antibiotic of choice. signs of secondary bacterial infection such as pneumonia as a result of a respiratory virus would be a high fever a worsening cough with expectoration of dark phlegm chest discomfort rapid respiration and lethargy. a mild sore throat or runny nose does not necessarily indicate a need for ampicillin.
a recent editorial in one of the major medical journals discussed the implications of additional post-residency fellowship training. fellowships are the medical professions finishing schools.  typically they go for one or two years after completion of a standard residency which itself can be up to seven years after medical school. therefore it is a significant investment by a young physician who already has spent much of his or her youth in training and education. fellowships are very important because as the world of medical practice â in all specialties â becomes more and more complex particularly because of new technology and science it is impossible to master all areas of the core specialty. that important editorial was written by a prominent educator in the specialty of head and neck surgery my core specialty. he noted that of the 265 trainees finishing residencies in head and neck surgery in approved american residencies 39 percent were pursuing additional fellowship training. that is an impressive percentage. the doctor felt that there were several reasons for that quest for more knowledge and experience. first and most laudable the desire for excellence. next the reality that many young doctors are now reluctant to go into private practice because of the expense the hassles of eternally battling insurance companies and more unproductive government regulation and meddling. tied to that they are going to be drawn to working at universities and other mega-sized multi-specialty medical centers. particularly with those seeking an academic affiliation a fellowship represents a great entry onto ones resume. however the most important thing is whether or not fellowship training for some percentage of surgeons is good for patients. my stance is that it is very important. the best surgeons within narrow niches of given specialties have generally had fellowship training. here is an example from another specialty. orthopedic surgery has so many divisions that it has long operated fellowship programs. after all there are orthopedic surgeons who sub-specialize in spine surgery hand surgery pediatric orthopedics and sports medicine. now there are orthopedic surgeons who do only joint replacements. a subset of that group are the superspecialists in artificial hip placement or artificial knee replacement. this is good for patients because it brings to them the most narrowly focused finely tuned specialty talent. whether you are considering having shoulder replacement or a hernia repair or cosmetic nasal plastic surgery you are generally in the best hands when those hands have been trained by a fellowship.
hello i have been through your same problems. it is not a comfortable situation. when i had this problem i went to my family md. first he did a urine test. well this was all it took to figure out that i had a very bad bladder infection. bladder infections can cause nausea back pain leakage burning when you urinate and some pelvic pain. in my opinion i would go see my dr. but until you can get into the dr. i would not drink any sodas any caffine alcohol or anything with high acid ( things like oj). drink lots of water. but i would go to the store and get some cranberry juice or in the pharmacy in the vitamins section there is a cranberry pill that is a very high concentrated cranberry oil. which helps to clean your urinary tract. one of these (the juice or the pills) will help you out a lot. just follow the instuctions on the back of the bottle of pills or if you are going to drink the juice i would drink 4-6 ounces 4 times a day. until you see the dr. info from someone who has been through this. i take cranberry pills everyday now. i have not had as many problems with this anymore and i strated taking the pills this about 3 years ago. if you do start this. make sure to talk to your dr. about it when you see him for your appointment. good luck to you. i hope this helps you and anyone else that may read this. god bless
it's possible that someone now buying insurance coverage on their own will find the new health plans being sold on the marketplaces in some cases will have richer benefits. but another huge potential benefit could be lower costs. many people with pre-existing conditions who buy their own insurance are being charged more because of their health. that's another practice insurers will be prohibited from starting january 1 2014. you'll be guaranteed a health plan and you can't be charged more for coverage. also there are tax credits available to people making up to about $46 000 per year. so that will lower costs for many people as well.
if you are pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant you should talk to your doctor about your medicines. do not stop or change them on your own. this includes medicines for depression asthma diabetes seizures (epilepsy) and other health problems. not using medicine that you need may be more harmful to you and your baby than using the medicine. for women living with hiv the cdc recommends using zidovudine (azt) during pregnancy. studies show that hiv positive women who use azt during pregnancy greatly lower the risk of passing hiv to their babies. if a woman with diabetes does not use her medicine during pregnancy she raises her risk for miscarriage stillbirth and some birth defects. if asthma and high blood pressure are not controlled during pregnancy problems with the fetus may result.
an expectorant causes you to cough. i am sure that your two-year old is doing just fine in that department. coughing is important because it helps your child clear her airway. an expectorant will only increase the amount of mucous that she will need to clear and she is unable to spit it out. this may cause her to vomit. personally i would not recommend that you use it unless her doctor specifically okayed it.
i think sometimes parents jump to the conclusion that a babys gas or fussiness is caused by their baby formula. instead it just may be that baby is at a stage when shes colicky. so instead of changing babys formula all around youd really do better to talk to your pediatrician. thats because intolerance to the baby formula is much less likely than colic for which we have no known cause  or cure. so instead of parents agonizing about the formula they probably just need to wait until baby outgrows the colic which is usually at about three months. another common bottle-feeding problem is the way parents position babies: some lie them completely flat which can make babies choke when feeding on the bottle. so be sure to have your baby semi-inclined or upright. another common mistake is propping the bottle. dont prop babys bottle; it can be a choking hazard. that is also why you should also always be present when baby is feeding even when shes old enough to hold her own bottle. . the main thing: do lots of trial-and-error to be sure you find a bottle and nipple combination that works for your child. so dont stock up on too many of the same kind of bottles unless you know your child is going to take it well. actually the same goes for formula diapers and all baby things: [dont stock up] unless you know your baby is adjusted to that type or brand. also when youre bottle feeding make sure milk is filling up the nipple of babys bottle. otherwise she could swallow a lot of air.

hi first thought could be from masturbating if you use a tight grip and no oil? try just masturbating with a feather light grip and some baby oil. or this could be from washing powder either your mother you or your wife uses your getting a reaction to it it may have been changed at the time you got the rash? if so just ask for your under wear to have extra rinses or ask for them to be washed in some natural soap. just see how this goes. good luck
eyebrow hair growth just like other hair requires a healthy diet rich in protein and nutrients. however the amount of hair that grows in the eyebrows decreases with age. to make sure that aging is not the only explanation for the loss in eyebrow hair visit your dermatologist. they can work you up and make sure that there are no other medical reasons.
plyometrics is a very dangerous method of exercising. there are no exceptions and the damage is cumulative. plyometrics involve jumping and landing both involving high acceleration and impact forces. my premise is that all injuries (i. e. tissue damage) are caused by the application of forces that exceed the structural tolerances of the tissues injured. a bone fracture is an obvious example. simply put plyometrics exposes a trainee to injury level forces and this is unnecessary to gain the adaptive benefits of exercise. the problem is not just limited to the spectrum of acute athletic injuries. those high level forces that are not high enough to cause catastrophic tissue failure can still proceed to damage structures like articular cartilage and loosen joint systems (muscle insertions ligaments musculotendinous junctions) in a sub-clinical way. this risk is elevated because of the risk of slipping due to the nature of the exercise. these repeated impact forces contributes to chronic degenerative disease with osteoarthritis as the ultimate result. articular cartilage can be slowly and significantly damaged over time and this has now been shown on runners where sequential mris were done over about 4 years. many people do not know that this asymptomatic damage is irreversible and over time this cumulative damage becomes debilitating.

"at your age your body is still developing and you need to make sure you're not only getting an adequate number of calories but adequate nutrition. you can start by calculating your basal metabolic rate (bmr) using this interactive calculator. bmr is dependent on your age sex height weight and activity level. using the calculator i entered your height as 5'10"" and your activity level as ""extremely active. "" this indicates you need about 3100 calories a day merely to maintain your current weight. you should input the correct data to get a better number to work from. beyond your calorie requirements you need to make sure you're taking in adequate levels of lean protein fruits and vegetables whole grains and heart-healthy fats like olive oil. and don't forget dairy (unless you're lactose intolerant). you want to develop healthy bones. to be honest it sounds to me like you're working out too much. i think you'd be wise to have your parent take you to see your health care provider for an evaluation of what a good calorie range and exercise regimen should be for you. i realize teen guys often play multiple sports and do just fine but a 40-pound weight loss (if unintentional) is not desirable at your age. get some professional guidance to stay healthy! and don't forget: your body needs plenty of rest too. when you exercise you break down muscle fibers. your body needs adequate time and nutrition to repair those fibers so you don't get injured. all the best to you!"

"then go to alanon for help. i am not sure how much help a ""walk-in"" clinic will provide to you. they certainly cannot provide the ongoing care and support that you may need to stop your drug use. doctor do not call the police when someone discloses illegal drug use. they cannot force you into rehab but this could be something they may suggest based on your usage and state of health. conversations between dr and patient are confidential and protected. telling your doctor that you may have a substance abuse problem and asking for help will most likely result in the suggestion and encouragement to enter rehab; however your doctor cannot force you to go. although in most cases cocaine abuse does not require detox most individuals who use cocaine also have other substance abuse including alcohol prescription painkillers and illicit drugs. in this case medical detox treatment can help them remove all the toxic chemicals related to their substance abuse from their body. after substance abuse detox treatment most people benefit from going through a rehab program or participating in behavioral therapy. substance abuse is more than a surface activity and usually stems from some deeper issue. a rehab program or counseling service will be able to help the individual get to the bottom of their cocaine use and help them resolve the issues. groups such as 12- step groups and other non-traditional non-12 step programs offer support within the community. these programs offer suggestions and explanations on how to avoid relapse. gallus detox center is a private inpatient medical detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929."
while you want to check with your pediatrician it sounds like your baby is experiencing infant regurgitation also called spit up where the contents in the stomach reflux back into the esophagus. this occurs frequently in babies because the muscles at the lower esophageal sphincter muscle (responsible for keeping food from coming back up) are weak. your pediatrician should be able to tell you if it is problematic which usually happens when reflux causes problems such as inflammation swallowing problems poor weight gain and food refusal. for the most part frequent regurgitation is considered normal when growth is fine and the child eats with well with no other signs of distress. because you are breastfeeding there could be other things contributing such as an overactive letdown (milk comes out fast) and laying baby down right after feeding. a lactation consultant can help you troubleshoot feeding your baby to decrease vomiting. for more on this subject see this webmd article. congrats on your new baby!

erectile dysfunction is a symptom of the conditions these medications treat. diabetes high cholesterol and high blood pressure are all associated with erectile dysfunction if not controlled properly. if it is a new symptom you should definitely talk to the doctor about it as it could be a warning sign of other medical conditions. of all of your husband's medications the atenolol would be most likely to cause ed.
unfortunately without the ability to see these spots first-hand by an examination i would not have enough information to address your question. babies can get milia newborn acne seborrheic dermatitis and even atopic dermatitis (eczema). you will need to address this concern with the pediatrician at your next well-child exam.
"you are correct. levoquin is an antibiotic and antibiotics do not work for viruses. the diagnosis of ""viral bronchitis"" is usually based solely on a clinical assumption since the medical provider probably did not perform a plethora of diagnostic tests that would confirm it. in the outside chance that a viral bronchitis could progress to a secondary bacterial infection a clinician may still empirically prescribe an antibiotic. since i do not know the details of the case or the medical history i cannot comment whether this antibiotic was warranted or not. levoquin is antibacterial and is usually doesnot work in viral infections. your doctor must have prescribed antibiotics as viral infections may progress to secondary bacterial infections. your consulting physician is best person to guide you on this."
"most colds last about seven to 10 days, but if your symptoms linger, you may need to call the doctor. sometimes, colds lead to an infection by bacteria in in your lungs, sinuses, or ears. if that happens, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics, which work against bacteria but not against viruses."

this may be a ganglion cyst. no a free clinic will not treat it and neither will the emergency room. you will need to see a hand surgeon once you have insurance or the financial resources to pay for a visit and the procedure (expensive). this is a cyst on a nerve so only an expert should be attempting to remove it. simply aspirating it with a needle (some medical providers do this) is unlikely to orchestrate a permanent cure. it will come back. slamming it with a book (my aunt claimed the book had to be a bible) is painful and unlikely to solve your problem. you can just leave it be for now and wait until you have insurance.

"this is kind of a ""loaded"" question. it is like saying can chiropractic care stop the sun from setting or prevent rain. osteoporosis is a bone disease with a decrease in bone density associated with aging (sun setting) or prolonged use of certain medications. scoliosis is either caused by structural abnormality of a vertebrae or idiopathic (unknown). on the flip side of that chiropractic care can certainly help relieve symptoms associated with scoliosis and in some case help manage the process. as children grow the scoliosis curvature needs to be monitored as well as any symptoms they are having. in an ideal world md's and dc's- pt's would work together to manage this process. if you want to live in an ideal world find ""specialists"" who are open minded and educated about not only what they can do but what others can do to help you as well. in the long run you are the one that has to live with whatever condition you have and no one else's ideology should be more important than that."
the only true method to determine who may be the father is by having a paternity test. but if your friends remembers when she had sexual relations with these two men it is possible to make a pretty accurate determination of paternity within a 10 day period. for example if the baby were to be born on october 18 2014 (case #1) then the probable range of conception would have been january 21 2014- january 29 2014 if the baby was born on october 1 2014 (case #2) then the probable range of conception would be january 4- january - january 12 2014. in case # 1 if sex occurred on january 23rd with man # 2 and on january 12th with man # 1 then man # 2 is the likely father. in case # 2 if sex occurred on january 6th with man # 1 and on january 18th with man # 2 then man # 1 would be the likely father. the doctor who confirmed your friend's pregnancy can provide an expected due date and also provide the probable date range for conception. there are also computer programs available on the internet which can also make the determination. all that is needed is the expected due date and the dates on which sex occurred with the two men.
and last sorry could not post all this in one go? can you get pregnant from sperm outside your body? if a man ejaculates around the labia of a womans vagina the tail like whip of the sperm may guide it to the inside of a womans vagina. the mission of each sperm is to reach the unfertilized egg and it has no problem with heading in the right direction if the travel occurs quickly it can get inside where it can live up to two weeks in the womans uterus before inpregnation. no once sperm touches oxygen or air it is killed. think of it as bacteria it dies when its not at body temperature. the two answers above are both false. first of all sperm are very fragile and they are not on a mission to reach a woman's egg. truth be told experiment after experiment has shown that sperm have no sense of direction and can't swim very well. thus the reason that millions of sperm must be present and ejaculated inside a woman so that maybe a handful can reach an egg (if present). also sperm don't die when they hit the air they only die once the semen dies. if you don't know semen is the liquid you can see that contains the sperm which you can't see. if the semen is dry the sperm are dead. think about this even under perfect conditions where both people are fertile and healthy the woman is perfectly ovulating and the man ejaculates directly into her vagina the chances of pregnancy are never more than 80%. so if under perfect conditions it is still relatively difficult to get pregnant than it is nearly impossible to get pregnant in any other fashion. put it this way there has never been a case other than the birth of jesus son of mary where a virgin gets pregnant. so in the real world a man can't just ejaculate on a woman and get her pregnant the two must have sex. it is impossible to keep your virginity and get pregnant because sperm must be inside a woman for her to get pregnant and this can't happen if there is no intercourse. if a man ejaculates on a woman's stomach face breasts etc. there is no chance of pregnancy because the sperm can't just waltz into a woman's vagina. many women may say that they didn't have sex and yet got pregnant but this is not the case. knowledge is power. so there you are there all from different sites some doctors and some not but you do have to remember that sperm when ejaculated inside the vagina is there at your cervix now just add all the way it has to travel through thick mucus and then it has to break into the cervix its a long way to go i know its there job and add into that its only a small amount of sperm it would not be the full load? so lots to have read and think about. but why not give it a try or trial to see if can be done? but please let us know how you got on. do hope this helps you. good luck
the bacteria that may be causing your uti may not be susceptible to the antibiotic that you took for the h. pylori.
"cystic fibrosis (sis-tik fi-bro-sis) or cf is an inherited disease of your secretory glands including the glands that make mucus and sweat. ""inherited"" means that the disease is passed through the genes from parents to children. people who have cystic fibrosis inherit two faulty cystic fibrosis genes â one from each parent. the parents likely don't have the disease themselves. cystic fibrosis mostly affects the lungs pancreas liver intestines sinuses and sex organs. mucus is a substance made by the lining of some body tissues. normally mucus is a slippery watery substance. it keeps the linings of certain organs moist and prevents them from drying out or getting infected. however if you have cystic fibrosis your mucus becomes thick and sticky. the mucus builds up in your lungs and blocks your airways â the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. the build-up of mucus makes it easy for bacteria to grow. this leads to repeated serious lung infections. over time these infections can severely damage your lungs. the thick sticky mucus also can block tubes or ducts in your pancreas. as a result the digestive enzymes that your pancreas makes can't reach your small intestine. these enzymes help break down the food that you eat. without them your intestines can't fully absorb fats and proteins. this can cause vitamin deficiency and malnutrition because nutrients leave your body unused. it also can cause bulky stools intestinal gas a swollen belly from severe constipation and pain or discomfort. cystic fibrosis also causes your sweat to become very salty. as a result your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. this can upset the balance of minerals in your blood and cause a number of health problems. examples include dehydration (a condition in which your body doesn't have enough fluids) increased heart rate tiredness weakness decreased blood pressure heat stroke and rarely death. if you or your child has cystic fibrosis you're also at increased risk for diabetes or a bone-thinning condition called osteoporosis. cystic fibrosis also causes infertility in men and it can make it harder for women to get pregnant."

hi you have to inform us your age duration of symptoms whether you are on any medical management extent of your body joints and spine involvement etc. considering all these have been done i would suggest you to concentrate on deep breathing exercises and pranayama. also we advise you to avoid the use of high pillows or a soft bed. now as you know the chest expansion is limited when one is having ankylosing spondylitis swimming is a good exercise that helps most joints in addition to the back. you may also need to check your vitamin d status and the calcium phosphorous and alkaline phosphatase levels. yoga can be tried but will have to be individually tailored. all the best for a sporty day. consult a physiotherapist online  
"you can't ""try"" to be tall. if it happens it happens. if late-bloomers are common in your family there is still a chance that you will have a final growth spurt but there is no way to make it happen. basically our height is determined at the moment of conception. since you are a product of your parent's dna you could achieve your dad's height or a blending of both your mother and father's height and i don't know how tall your mother is. unless you have some very very tall grandparents to influence your genetics it may not be very likely at your age to reach 6' 4"" but time will reveal that answer. you are already taller than the average american man so congratulations. any more height should be considered a bonus."

benadryl is a nonprescription antihistamine which contains diphenhydramine as the active ingredient. benadryl can be used in children over the age of 6. one of the main side effects of benadryl is drowsiness; however in young children sometimes the reverse happens and the child gets excited. so depending on your childs age it may be ok to give benadryl safely with an antibiotic.
"it's an interesting question. if an object of any size or shape gets inserted into the rectum it can get stuck (or as we like to say in medicine ""retained"") due to the strength of the external anal sphincter. this is the powerful muscle that enables us to hold in or release stool. when an object slips beyond the anal sphincter it can be very hard to get out. you might be surprised how many people go to the emergency room each year to have a foreign object removed from the rectum. however it's unlikely an object would travel up the bowel and deeper into the colon. in the first place peristalsis (a rhythmic contraction of muscles along the digestive tract) naturally propels the contents of the intestines toward the anus. for a foreign object to move against the effects of peristalsis would be akin to a salmon swimming upstream. that's not to say it absolutely couldn't happen i guess. never say never? wishing you well!"
chances are if you have lived in the us for most of your life you have been exposed to chicken pox even if you didn't show symptoms. the virus remains dormant in your body and then reactivates as shingles - any more questions contact your local pharmacy. pharmacists are very educated on shingles and there is a vaccination for it as well which is recommended for anyone over 50. 1 out of 3 people will get shingles in their lifetime.
you are going to finish your active pills a day early. so you can decide to start your new pack of pills a day early to stay on the 7-day placebo schedule. if you choose to skip a day and wait to start the new pack on your regularly scheduled day there is a very slight chance that the one day can make a difference in the risk of an unexpected pregnancy. the more pills you miss the more likely you are to get pregnant.
so sorry to hear you're dealing with all of that. it can feel overwhelming. i admire your desire to get to the root of the various problems and fix them. that's a great attitude to take. unfortunately there are some health problems for which we can only treat symptoms not the cause. let me explain. congestive heart failure (chf) means your heart is not able to pump as strongly as it once did. as a result your blood cannot carry as much oxygen to the tissues as it used to. this problem causes your symptoms of shortness of breath (sob) edema and possibly the heaviness/pressure in your left chest. unfortunately chf is a chronic disease. there is no cure for the underlying cause. your thyroid disease is treatable with medications. i assume your doctor put you on medication or has outlined some sort of treatment plan for your thyroid disease. this is a case where the underlying cause of your symptoms (weight gain mental fog) can be addressed. i wish you all the best as you address your health issues in a constructive fashion!
i think you might be experiencing complicated infection in lung that caused pleurisy. a sputum culture is needed to show which bacteria is it and what antibiotic is suitable for its treatment. later. breathing exercises and avoiding cold air is going to help. using also spirometer can help increase your lung capacity. a cup of coffee in the morning after a small meal is good for helping bronchospasm. reduce carbs intake.

athlete's foot (tinea pedis) is a fungal infection of the skin of the foot. most athlete's foot is caused by one of two types of fungus. trichophyton mentagrophytes often causes toe web or vesicular (blisterlike) infections. the infection appears suddenly is severe and is easily treated. trichophyton rubrum often causes moccasin-type infections. this condition lasts for a long time (chronic) and is difficult to treat. you get athletes foot when you come in contact with the fungus and it begins to grow on your skin. fungi commonly grow on or in the top layer of human skin and may or may not cause infections. fungi grow best in warm moist areas such as the area between the toes. athlete's foot is easily spread (contagious)-you can get it by touching the affected area of a person who has it. more commonly you pick up the fungi from damp contaminated surfaces such as the floors in public showers or locker rooms. although athlete's foot is contagious some people are more likely to get it ( susceptible ) than others. susceptibility may increase with age. experts don't know why some people are more likely to get it. after you have had athlete's foot you are more likely to get it again. if you come in contact with the fungi that cause athlete's foot you can spread the fungi to others whether you get the infection or not. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

prostate cancer is a group of cells that grows faster than normal in a man's prostate gland. it can spread into other areas and kill normal tissue. the prostate gland sits just below a man's bladder. it makes part of the fluid for semen. in young men the prostate is about the size of a walnut. it usually grows larger as you grow older. the cancer may be one of these types: locally advanced prostate cancer. this is cancer that has grown through the outer rim of the prostate and into nearby tissue. metastatic prostate cancer. this is cancer that has spread or metastasized to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body. recurrent prostate cancer. this is cancer that has come back after it was treated. the cancer can come back in the prostate near the prostate or in another part of the body. if it comes back in another part of the body-often the bones-it is still called prostate cancer because it started in the prostate. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

"what kind of drug test? what drug are you testing for and why? if you are referring to illegal drugs or abuse of prescription drugs these tests can be order in a regular lab by your medical provider. the cost is usually covered by insurance in this case. there are also independent labs who do this for a fee. you simply obtain the urine specimen and mail it to them with a check. if you are testing a minor like your teenager then the collection of urine is critical. many teens who are abusing drugs are slick. they will have ""clean urine"" stashed in the bathroom to use. i have even had a few pour diet mountain dew in a urine cup to be tested. strangely enough you can actually buy clean urine on the internet as well as tricky devices that simulate actual urination (using someone else's pee incidentally) if they are being observed."
i don't recommend that you perform any type of self-surgery on your penis. it doesn't cost that much. or is it that involved to have a professional do this for you; painlessly and without a risk of infection. i understand there are many reasons why you may not want to see a doctor that is your choice. i am gay and have anal sex i got an anal wart on the shaft of my penis once by not using a condom i used compound w to remove it. mind you this will burn and hurt and it will take a few applications but it should remove your tag. try to keep the compound w only on the tag and not cover a large area. again and fair warning this is going to burn and hurt! if you do happen to try to do this on your own make sure you keep the area extra clean afterwards. the last thing you want is an infection down there. using an antibacterial penis health creme would be smart too. man1 man oil is a good one. you can get it online. good luck!
"i'm sorry your baby is going through this. good for you for following the instructions to the letter in using the inhaler. it's very important to use all medications for infants exactly as prescribed. because your baby has developed new symptoms you should take her back to the pediatrician. although this may sound like the ""same"" cough as before her persistent coughing could be a sign of something else going on. your pediatrician will want to examine her and perhaps run additional tests to look for answers. meanwhile i would call the pediatrician's office to ask whether it is ok to continue using the inhaler. generally doctors like to see the patient when she is exhibiting symptoms. it may be uncomfortable for your baby to be coughing a lot but it also may be important for the doctor to see this during the examination. your pediatrician's office will guide you as to whether or not to treat the cough between now and your visit. wishing you well!"

hi cant find any info why but did find this on medhelp see if you think it helps you. i just wanted to explain how the copper t works for those of you that do not know. i found out of this out by doing my own research through several different places because usually a dr will not explain everything to you or they do not explain in a way you can understand. first off there is a reason it is called a copper t. the iud is made of copper and shaped like a t. the reason is made of copper is because copper actually kills sperm. the fluids inside your body kill a lot of sperm the moment it is introduced the copper helps to kill the rest. it is shaped like a t because the top part of the is attached to your uterus where an egg would typically attach itself. that way even if your fluid and the copper didn't kill all the sperm and an egg did get fertalized it usually will not attach to the uterine wall. it is possible for the egg to attach to another part of the uterine wall but is unlikely and usually when this happens there is a miscarrage (miscarriage) becuase the fetus cannot receive what is need through it's location. this all contributes to why it is more likely to have an eptopic pregnancy while you have an iud. if the egg cannot attach to the uterine wall sometimes it will attach to the folopian tube (eptopic pregnancy). this can be very dangerous and needs to be taken care of right away. although an eptopic pregnancy is more likely with women that have an iud that doesn't mean it's going to happen. the copper t along with your body kills almost of the sperm and in most women even if an egg does get fertalized if it cannot attach to the right spot on uterine wall usually it is simply discharged when you get your period. i know it can still be scary even though i have all this information i'm still scared when i am late but the less you stress about it the quicker you will get your period if you truly are not pregnant. hope it helps in some way. good luck
different diet pills contain different ingredients that have different mechanisms. certain ones favor the blocking of absorption via the intestines while others increase the metabolism thus taking care of the excess of calories. because of the large offerings available you might want to consult a nutritionist on a specific pill available to you. in the end have in mind that dieting is not recommended for people who suffer from certain diseases so you might want to consult your family doctor about being on diet and whether or not it is good for you.

you seem concerned by the possibility of autism in your 4 year old son. autism includes a broad spectrum of symptoms. therefore a single brief evaluation cannot predict a child's true abilities. ideally a team of different specialists will evaluate the child. they might evaluate:communication language motor skills speech success at school thinking abilities because there is no biological test for autism the diagnosis will often be based on very specific criteria from a book called the diagnostic and statistical manual iv. autism can be associated with other disorders that affect the brain such as:fragile x syndrome mental retardation tuberous sclerosis you must consult an appropriate medical facility where autism kids are evaluated and treated as the same is not possible online. hope this helps. take care. note: this answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only. please see your personal physician for further evaluation of your individual case.
if you're training for an endurance event like a marathon when you might run 60 miles or more per week you'll almost always see a decrease in your muscle mass. for most of us who do more moderate amounts of physical activity there will be minimal if any loss in muscle mass from aerobic exercise  so there's nothing to worry about. if you do plan on lots of aerobic exercise and are concerned about losing muscle try starting with 20-30 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise (at 50% to 70% of your maximum heart rate) two to three days per week and see how it goes.

"fsas are offered as an individual employee benefit so each member of a married couple can have his or her own fsa account assuming one is available to each separately at work. fsas allow employees to set aside salary tax-free to pay for health-care expenses not covered by insurance for themselves and their dependents. that includes deductibles co-pays and co-insurance for medical and dental care. fsa limits as of today there's no maximum contribution set for health fsas; it's left up to your employer to set one and many employers do establish a maximum says anne waidmann a director of human resource services for price waterhouse cooper. a $5 000 cap on contributions is most common. that means you and your spouse may currently be able to contribute $5 000 each for a total of $10 000. but health reform will usher in some changes for these tax-free accounts. starting in 2013 for example the maximum contribution an employee can make to an fsa will be $2 500. ""if an employee and spouse are both employed and earn more than $2 500 each they can each contribute that amount to their fsas for a total of $5 000 "" waidmann says. until that change takes effect however check with your employer to find out what the maximum contribution is for 2011 and 2012. . for a list of medical expenses covered by an fsa you can check the irs's website."
the trouble with hiv is it shares symptoms with many many other illnesses. many of those symptoms can be found in yourself with enough hard thought. hiv is also something that's very common to be afraid of understandably. it would be nearly impossible for your girlfriend to have gotten hiv from an abortion. direct blood to blood or sexual activity would have had to happen at the office. her medical professionals were wearing gloves washing hands sterilizing equipment just so she wouldn't have to worry about getting a disease. your anxiety has picked hiv as your own personal 'boogeyman.

i've been dealing with panic disorder; officially since 1976. i'm not sure there is just one singular cause of it period. it could be in your diet the air or even the water we drink. something triggers the flight / fight syndrome when there doesn't seem to be a reason for it. something is activating the adrenal glands. i do think stress; while it's hard to tell if you're under stress sometimes will cause the episodes or make them more intense. dealing with this issue; when you're new to it can cause much stress. i've been on benzodiazepines on and off since 1976. ive been more on meds over the last 25 years than off. your medication doses may need adjusted but anti depressants tend to give you a boost or make you feel weird; which can kick in an attack. try looking for more holistic approaches to feeling better like change your diet see it if helps. exercise try meditation reading or listening to your favorite music and breathing exercises help a lot. the medication; should you stay on it long will eventually need changes to another type or a higher dose. my panic was so bad; i had to open my own company to stay at home whenever i had to. it usually comes and goes; as they say waxes and wanes. usually it has other phobias which develop as well. you want to steer clear of people and places which you think cause the attacks. i don't know that they will ever disappear; however they should diminish in frequency and intensity. best of luck and work on your end helps a lot!
the most recent research suggests that one whole egg a day does not increase the risk of heart disease for healthy individuals. individuals who have problems controlling their total and ldl cholesterol may want to be more cautious about eating egg yolks. for people who have heart disease it is best to limit whole egg consumption to no more than three yolks per week. the yolk contains the cholesterol so eating egg whites more often should not increase the risk for heart disease.

i do not believe that urticaria (hives) and teething have a direct causative effect but manythings can cause hives. even stress. teething is a normal childhood event that really should not be overly-stressful to a child. teething can hurt so i guess it is remotely possible. most hives are idiopathic (no identifiable cause) so don't be too diligent in your investigation. you child's hives could be anything that he has touched breathed or eating. it can also be caused by temperature changes like being too warm in those fuzzy pajamas.
this is very common during exercise particularly during walking and especially so when it gets hot and humid. fluid tends to accumulate in the extremities as the result of the arm swing and holding arms straight. it can be bad enough that people need to remove their rings before exercising. one solution is that every few minutes raise your hands over your head and clench and relax your hands. some people will carry a squeeze ball which keeps the blood and other fluids flowing in and out of the hands. you can also hold your arms at 90 degrees and use a race-walk style arm swing.

"as you may know it would be impossible to diagnose you over the internet especially if you are having complex psychiatric symptoms. being evaluated by a good psychiatrist is your first and most important step. should this mental health professional feel that you would benefit from medications to help you deal with your array of concerns they can appropriately prescribe them for you. you owe it to yourself and those who love and care about you to get properly evaluated and treated. one of your questions is "" are these (symptoms) just the effects of stress? "" i don't think that they are just stress related. you are also not ""crazy"" as suggested in your post. schizophrenic individuals for example feel that their hallucinations are real while you definitely live in a state of reality in being aware that you are daydreaming. maladaptive daydreaming (preoccupation with daydreaming where large blocks of daily time are spent fantasying) ) is not well understood by many medical professionals. its cause is unknown. some of your symptoms like feeling paranoid intense and complex daydreaming (can be so realistic that its as though you're reading a novel) and feeling anxious can all be related to the one disorder maladaptive daydreaming. here's what you can do: look for triggers that may set of the daydreaming episodes. some activities like playing video games may activate the daydreaming and oftentimes associated fantasies; be good to yourself and realize that you'll have good and bad days with mdd. look for positive ways to plan and spend your time and divert your actions away from daydreaming; find a physician that thoroughly understands maladaptive daydreaming and follow their treatment directions. with talk therapy and medications you can decrease these unwanted chucks of wasted time being taken away from what should be a productive day. i am optimistic about your future."

osteoarthritis is a breakdown of the cartilage between our joints. symptoms including pain and stiffness usually begin after age 40. aging definitely increases the likelihood of getting osteoarthritis and if we live long enough almost everyone develops osteoarthritis to some degree. heredity can also play a role. however the degree to which you are affected is more often determined by how much you abused your joints in your younger years. your weight also makes a big difference particularly for osteoarthritis of the hips and knees. losing even a little weight can reduce symptoms and slow the progress of osteoarthritis. building strong leg muscles can also help reduce osteoarthritis of the knee.

although milk and dairy are the best sources of calcium you can certainly get enough even if you dont drink milk. if dairy milk or cow's milk makes your stomach upset or if you are lactose intolerant there are plenty of lactose-free milks on the market. also yogurt is the best source of calcium with 415 mg in 8 ounces. even people with lactose intolerance can typically eat yogurt with no problem because the probiotics in yogurt help digest the lactose. if dairy is not an option other good food sources for calcium are calcium-fortified soy milk or other forms of non-dairy milk calcium-fortified cereals turnip greens and kale. if you find it tough to get the recommended 1000-1200 mg/day calcium supplements (which are often combined with vitamin d) can help fill the gap as well.

the pregnancy would not survive. the sperm and egg of different species are incompatible. technically a pregnancy may begin but will soon spontaneously terminate. a human has 46 chromosomes with the male and female each contributing 23 chromosomes to their offspring. a horse has 64 chromosomes with the male and female each contributing 32 chromosomes to their offspring. a union between a horse and human would result in a shared chromosome total of 55. therefore the egg recognizes the irrational number of chromosomes and rejects the pregnancy.
treatments for enlarged prostate include: watchful waiting. patients who have an enlarged prostate but who are not suffering symptoms or whose symptoms are not bothersome may be advised by their doctor to merely get an annual checkup which might include a variety of tests. making lifestyle changes. changes could include limiting drinking at night and before bedtime especially drinks containing alcohol or caffeine. drug therapy. two common treatments for bph are alpha-blockers which alleviate bph symptoms and 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors which help shrink the prostate. many men take them together. surgery. this is generally used for men with severe symptoms who haven't been helped by other treatment.
"its important to wipe thoroughly after you have diarrhea, but too much cleaning can backfire. even the softest toilet paper can be rough on your skin, and crumbled bits of it can get trapped inside skin folds. in the bath or shower, even natural or gentle soaps that dont have perfumes can strip your skin of its natural oils, which makes the problem worse."
good blood sugar control means keeping blood glucose levels within the ideal range (70 to 100 mg/dl before meals less than 120 mg/dl two hours after eating and 100-140 mg/dl before the bedtime snack) as well as balancing meals exercise and diabetes medications. good blood sugar control is important before becoming pregnant because many women do not even know they are pregnant until the baby has been growing for two to four weeks. high blood sugar levels early in the pregnancy (before 13 weeks) can cause birth defects. good blood sugar control is just as important during pregnancy because high blood sugar levels can increase the risk of miscarriage and can increase your risk of developing diabetes-related complications.
"while it's true you can get diphenhydramine (benadryl) as a prescription the issue isn't so much about the dosage (amount or number of milligrams) as it is about the delivery method. ""prescription"" diphenhydramine often is delivered intravenously while over-the-counter diphenhydramine is delivered orally or as a skin cream (topically). the usual adult dose of oral diphenhydramine is 25mg to 50mg. it would be unwise to exceed 50mg of diphenhydramine if for no other reason that it causes extreme drowsiness. also people with certain medical conditions should not take diphenhydramine. if you have any questions about prescription or over-the-counter (otc) medications you can always consult a pharmacist. they're the experts when it comes to dosing side effects and every other aspect of medications. please do not play backyard chemist by trying to create ""prescription strength"" medications from otc versions. it's very dangerous. hope this helps!"

there are ways to prevent earaches from colds or ear infections in children and adults. often altering the home environment is all that's needed but sometimes surgery is necessary too. you should talk about the following precautions with your doctor. protect your child from colds especially the first year of life. most ear infections start with colds. ear infections can occur after the flu so ask your doctor about an annual flu shot. most kids receive the pneumococcal vaccine which helps prevent infections with streptococcus pneumoniae which used to be one of the main causes of ear infections. ask your doctor if you're not sure your child has received this vaccine which is usually given before age 2. avoid contact with second-hand tobacco smoke which increases the frequency and severity of ear infections. control allergies. inflammation caused by allergies is a contributing factor to ear infection. if you can breastfeed your baby during the first six to 12 months of life. antibodies in breast milk reduce the rate of ear infections. if you bottle-feed avoid bottle propping holding your baby at a 45-degree angle. feeding in the horizontal position can cause formula and other fluids to flow back into the eustachian tubes. allowing an infant to hold his or her own bottle also can cause milk to drain into the middle ear. weaning your baby from a bottle between nine and 12 months of age will help stop this problem. watch for mouth breathing or snoring which may be caused by large adenoids. these may contribute to ear infections. an exam by an otolaryngologist and even surgery to remove the adenoids (adenoidectomy) may be necessary.

paget's disease is a long-lasting (chronic) condition that causes abnormal bone growth. bone is constantly being replaced as bone tissue is broken down and absorbed into the body then rebuilt with new cells. in the early stages of paget's disease bone tissue is broken down and absorbed much faster than normal. to keep up with the rapid breakdown of bone tissue the body speeds up the bone rebuilding process. but this new bone is often weak and brittle causing it to break (fracture) more easily. paget's disease usually affects the bones in the pelvis spine thigh ( femur ) skull shin (tibia) and upper arm ( humerus ). one bone or several bones may be affected by paget's disease. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

yes but there are rules governing how much more they can charge starting in 2014. varying premiums based on age is called age rating.  before the affordable care act insurers could essentially charge as much as they wanted. now they face rate restrictions  on age rating which means that insurers are restricted by how much they charge older adults. the maximum they can charge is a 3:1 ratio for adults age 21 and older. this means that older americans who generally utilize more health services than younger americans can only be charged three times as much as their younger counterparts. for example if the annual premiums of someone who is 21 years of age totals $1800 the annual total for someone in her early 60s can be no more than $5400. yes but it is limited to 3 times as high
yes. that is okay/

the cause of crohn's disease is unknown. studies suggest that this and other inflammatory bowel diseases may result from an abnormal response by the body's immune system to normal intestinal bacteria. 1 disease-causing bacteria and viruses also may play a role in causing the condition. crohn's disease can run in families so some people may be more likely than others to develop the condition when exposed to something that triggers an immune reaction. environmental factors may also play a role in causing the disease. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

it sounds like your friend is bothered by the persistent tingling and numbness in his left foot. i understand these sensations can be quite irritating especially if your work involves standing for long periods. did he have these tingling sensations in the same areas before the surgery? if so have these worsened after the surgery or remained the same? i assume his symptoms before the surgery were also on the left side and his hemilaminectomy was also performed on the left side. it will be nice if i could see the preoperative mri images to see what the hemilaminectomy was done for. often if the surgery involves removal of a large herniated disc or the space available for the nerve is very less (stenosis) then the nerve may get bruised during surgery due to retraction. this means that in order to decompress the nerve the surgeon has to retract the nerve to go around the nerve and remove the compressing elements. if the compression is severe the nerve gets bruised easily and there may be persistent numbness and tingling in the areas of the leg and foot that are geographically supplied by that nerve. since the surgeon has advised him to wait it out i assume this is likely the case. swelling of the foot is common if the nerve supplying that area is not fully functional. the weak muscles in the leg and foot are not able to push the blood back up towards the heart and gravity causes this dependent area to swell up. this is often seen at the end of the day and gets better at night when he sleeps. it is difficult to predict how long the tingling will last. it could be a few months. the fact that there is tingling and not pure numbness is actually encouraging although it is more irritating to the patient. if it were a complete nerve injury then only numbness would be experienced. the presence of tingling means that the nerve is just irritated inflamed and swollen due to the bruising. if the tingling is very bothersome he may try some neuralgic pain medications like gabapentin or pregabalin. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (nsaids) may also help in this situation. there is a very rare possibility of other complications like recurrent disc herniation other post-surgical changes irritating the nerve etc. these are difficult to diagnose and usually need a new mri with contrast. however it is advisable to delay such investigation for at least for two to three months after surgery since the mri images at this stage will be obscured by the post surgical changes. if the symptoms of tingling and numbness are progressively worsening and if he develops back pain a new mri may be needed irrespective of the time since surgery to rule out infection or instability. the probable causes:surgical retraction of nerve that may have caused it to bruise. investigations to be done:none if symptoms are not progressively worsening. differential diagnosis:recurrent disc herniation. treatment plan:gabapentin or pregabalin and nsaids. regarding follow up:for further doubts consult a spine surgeon online. -

"thanks for your question on healthcare magic. i can understand your concern. radiological resolution takes 2-3 weeks in pneumonia. so it is possible that patient of pneumonia is improved symptomatically but still show pneumonia on chest x ray. so in my opinion, you should should waiting for 2 weeks more. get done repeat chest x ray after 2 weeks.if chest x ray is showing pneumonia then go for ct thorax and bronchoscopy to rule out lung cancer, tuberculosis, fungal pneumonia. if xun4 ray is improving then no need to worry. hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wishing good health to your mother. thanks."

a stye can cause inflammation and inflammation can cause edema/swelling  one that will self-resolve over time. another possibility would be a secondary infection (bacterial) that may require antibiotics. this cannot be determined unless you have a hands-on examination by your medical provider.
hi such transient episodes can happen due to temporary optic artery blockage or angiospasms. a ct angiography can help rule this out. also a mri brain with contrast will help rule out other causes. thanks
"i'm sorry you're going through this. sleep problems are very difficult to cope with! it sounds like you've been trying all the right things and you're taking medications that should make it easier to sleep  but obviously are not. i'd suggest you try some non-medicinal techniques to help you get some sleep. good ""sleep hygiene"" (or a collection of practices you use regularly to maintain the sleep/wake cycle) can make a world of difference. avoid napping during the day exercise regularly if you are able and have been cleared by a physician to do so (even simply taking a walk each day is helpful) avoid eating a large meal close to bedtime keep your bed for sleep only; don't lie around in it and watch tv or read during the day maintain a relaxing bedtime routine such as taking a warm bath before bed then spending a few minutes reading before you turn out the light create a relaxing bedroom environment with low light and a comfortable temperature if these things don't help and your sleeplessness continues you may want to visit with your health care provider about other ways to solve this problem. good luck to you!"
there are many many reasons to have a mild temperature elevation. as a matter of fact dependind on the time of day that you took the temperature a temp of 100 could be considered a variation of normal. the normal body temperture hovers around 99 and tends to be a bit higher in the evening; lower in the mornings. fever is usually the body's normal response to fighting of an infection (viruses like colds) or respond to inflammation. while autoimmune disorders can be on this extensive list of reasons for a mild fever it would not be high on the list. you would need to see your medical provider for a thorough medical history some diagnostic tests and a careful examination to determine if an autoimmune disorder was the underlying reason. it is not really necessary to treat a fever especially a mild one with ibuprofen or acetaminophen. remember this is a normal response and fever helps with our immune response. unless you are particularly uncomfortable a fever can be just left alone

nervous breakdown is not a clinical term so it doesnt mean anything specific to doctors. people may use nervous breakdown to describe an episode of severe emotional distress. the word breakdown may suggest the person showed unusual behavior or stopped performing his or her expected duties at home or work. people described as having a nervous breakdown may or may not meet the criteria for a formal psychiatric diagnosis.
young children the elderly and immunocompromised persons are at the highest risk for infection but resistant infections are occurring among all patient age groups and populations. when we look at surveillance data for certain infections like the type of streptococcus that causes meningitis pneumonia and bloodstream infections the prevalence of resistant infections has increased over time. we're seeing a rise in antibiotic resistance for all age groups and for a number of different bacteria.

"preparing a tooth for a crown usually requires two visits to the dentist  the first step involves examining and preparing the tooth the second visit involves placement of the permanent crown. first visit: examining and preparing the tooth. at the first visit in preparation for a crown your dentist may take a few x-rays to check the roots of the tooth receiving the crown and surrounding bone. if the tooth has extensive decay or if there is a risk of infection or injury to the tooth's pulp a root canal treatment may first be performed. before the process of making your crown is begun your dentist will anesthetize (numb) your tooth and the gum tissue around the tooth. next the tooth receiving the crown is filed down along the chewing surface and sides to make room for the crown. the amount removed depends on the type of crown used (for instance all-metal crowns are thinner requiring less tooth structure removal than all-porcelain or porcelain-fused-to-metal ones). if on the other hand a large area of the tooth is missing (due to decay or damage) your dentist will use filling material to ""build up"" the tooth to support the crown. after reshaping the tooth your dentist will use impression paste or putty to make an impression of the tooth to receive the crown. impressions of the teeth above and below the tooth to receive the dental crown will also be made to make sure that the crown will not affect your bite. the impressions are sent to a dental laboratory where the crown will be manufactured. the crown is usually returned to your dentist's office in 2 to 3 weeks. if your crown is made of porcelain your dentist will also select the shade that most closely matches the color of the neighboring teeth. during this first office visit your dentist will make a temporary crown to cover and protect the prepared tooth while the crown is being made. temporary crowns usually are made of acrylic and are held in place using a temporary cement. second visit: receiving the permanent dental crown. at your second visit your dentist will remove your temporary crown and check the fit and color of the permanent crown. if everything is acceptable a local anesthetic will be used to numb the tooth and the new crown is permanently cemented in place."
last week i started in on soup. the weather is distinctly fall and even feeling wintry in some parts of the country. it is definitely soup weather. we ran out of my nonis minestrone on saturday afternoon this weekend at my restaurant (the amount we made would have usually lasted through monday! ). since our minestrone takes all day to make i needed to come up with a quick soup to fill in for the cold and rainy saturday crowd. i deferred to my favorite butternut squash soup. i have been on a bit of a band wagon for the winter squashes. it is squash season and i think they are versatile and delicious so bear with me. butternut squash soup can be so creamy and delicious with no cream added. i start by putting 1-3 whole squashes in the oven and roasting at 400 with skins on until they are soft enough to easily cut with a sharp knife (about 5-10 minutes). from there i cut them in half lengthwise and remove the seeds. do not throw these little crunchy nuggets of goodness away! you can clean the seeds sprinkle with salt and roast them to make a great topping for the soup. next decide which direction flavor-wise you want to go. indian? sprinkle the squash liberally with your favorite curry powder before you roast. if you want an herb flavor use fresh thyme or sage and garlic cloves. now that you have added your favorite herbs and spices roast the cleaned out squash until they are very tender and starting to get a bit golden. when they reach this point remove from the oven scoop the flesh out of the skins and place it in a blender. you can add chicken or vegetable stock and blend until smooth. i also like to sautÃ© onion or shallot in a bit of olive oil until soft and add it to the squash in the blender. from here you can top with the toasted seeds and a bit of plain yogurt (add lemon zest a pinch of salt and a squeeze of juice to create a crÃ¨me fraiche-like topping for the soup). serve this warm and satisfying soup with a side salad and toasted multigrain bread for a comforting and healthy dinner.
a cough in a healthy 4 year old can be many things. most commonly colds from viral infections can cause coughs. other causes can be allergies post nasal drip and asthma. if your child has had the cough for several weeks it is important to speak to your doctor. if he has allergies or asthma that is causing this there are medications available to make him feel better. call your doctor.
there are many conditions that can cause fatigue. some of the more common ones include anemia thyroid problems sleep disorders depression and diabetes. if your fatigue persists it would be good to see a doctor for a medical evaluation. some lifestyle measures that can be helpful in combating fatigue are to get adequate sleep 7 - 9 hours per night eat a healthy diet and exercise regularly. if there is a lot of stress in your life taking measures to reduce stress can often help as well. i have extreme fatigue as well mine used to be due to a thyriod disorder so you might wanna get that checked out. however due to medication my levels are normal now. i believe now i am still tired from either depression anxiety or stress. also do you wear glasses/contacts? if not you may wanna get your eyes checked because bad vision can cause strain on your eyes causing you eye pain head aches and chronic fatigue.

"first let me extend my condolences on your miscarriage. it is a grief unlike any other. i'm sorry you went through that. to answer your question painful ovulation is not uncommon. many women experience a ""pinch"" during ovulation. other women experience something called "" mittelschmerz "" which refers to painful ovulation. mittelschmerz can cause abdominal pain. it does not have anything to do with your miscarriage. i hope this sets your mind at ease. if you are still concerned please make an appointment with your gynecologist. he or she is in the best position to help you understand what's going on and whether it's normal for you. best wishes!"
this sounds just exactly like an issue that i dealt with for months in 2014. hubby and i went on vacation and on the last couple of days i was having an itch right at my waist line in the back. it wasn't too bad and i didn't think too much of it at the time. it would come and go. the day we got home it got worse. i looked in the mirror and there was a couple of spots each about the size of a quarter that looked like hives. i put an ice pack on it to relieve the itching and after half an hour or so it went away. over the course of about 2 months my nutritionist and i tried and tried to figure it out but it would just come and go several times a day. sometimes on my arms other times it was on my stomach or legs or back. very random. at times it would be circular in shape. other times it would show up as long lines or irregular shapes. definitely looked like hives though. then suddenly it just stopped. i realized one day that it had been a week and no new out breaks. it started on our vacation in august 2014 and ended sometime around november/december 2014. then just this past week it happened again. i noticed my arm pits itching a little one evening but again didn't think much of it. wasn't too bad just a little annoyance a couple times. the next morning i woke up to bright red pits and the same hive looking spots on my stomach. i started thinking about what was different during the time that i didn't have the hives. the only thing i could come up with was the while on our vacation last year we had lots of specialty coffee drinks from a famous coffee shop that i won't name here. i continued to have them several times a week until sometime in the fall don't remember when. just last weekend we decided to have them again a couple times that weekend. large ones. two days later the hives were back. that makes me sad but i guess maybe i need to lay off the expensive coffee drinks and just have my coffee here at home. it can be different things for different people but thought i would mention this just in case it might help someone else. i never thought at the time that my coffee drinks could be the problem (and it may just be a coincidence) but for now i think i'll avoid them.
some people are more susceptible than others: it's not clear why that is. you can be with a group and all consume the same thing and some get sick while others do not. there are a host factors involved. stomach acid is our first defense mechanism against organisms that we ingest. therefore those on antacids or who just have low stomach acid often get travelers' diarrhea more easily. people who have underlying diseases of the gut such as crohns disease or aids may be more susceptible to certain types of organisms causing travelers diarrhea.

when we talk about acid peels what these are doing is that they are creating a controlled chemical burn of the skin. these should be done by trained and qualified physicians. ideally dermatologists or plastic surgeons. what they can do depending on the concentration is cause an exfoliation of the skin that will reveal healthy newer skin behind it. glycolic acids come in different strength. they can be as low as a 5% up to a 70% and depending on whether or not it's buffered so how neutral it is what the ph of it is can affect how powerful that treatment is. that needs to be neutralized in order to turn it off. so the longer you leave it on the skin the longer the results last. salicylic acid is often called a beta lift or a beta peel and this does not need to be neutralized. so we have different concentrations it can be 20-30% and you have to be careful because this is absorbed into the body so we have to limit the body surface area that we apply. we wouldn't do the face and the back in one treatment because too much of the product would be absorbed and can cause systemic problems or problems internally. so it does need to be done in a very careful and monitored way. but it does turn off by itself. afterwards you get red and you peel. i like the beta or the salicylic acid peels for people who are more acne-prone and the glycolic acids for general skin rejuvenation. the lactic acid peels are more gentle in the alpha hydroxy or glycolic acid family of peels. they tend to be better for more sensitive and more dry skin. trichloric acetic acid peels tend to be very strong. you have to be especially careful with these. in as low as 10% concentration that tends to be very gentle but unlike the other peels every time you apply it you are getting a stronger concentration. so if you take a 10% peel and you keep dabbing it over the spot you can get up to a 30-40% concentration. so there is a lot of finesse that go around these products. it is also self-neutralizing which is good because it turns itself off but also we don't have a neutralizer for it. so if you have too strong a product on your skin that can create a chemical burn that can be significant. so these are treatments that should be done under the supervision or directly by your physician. you need to be evaluated to make sure that your skin is healthy enough for this treatment and you need to know what to expect afterwards; what the downtime is what the skincare is in order to get the best results out of them.

since this was your first anxiety attack i'm wondering if there are some stressor in your life currently that might be causing this. often we don't realize that we are under stress until our body tells us by doing something like this. i know it's quite upsetting can be frightening but you shouldn't be embarrassed. you have done nothing for which you need to be embarrassed. it's your body responding to something either internal or external. i see that your prescriber has done the prudent thing and has given you something to use as needed. this is always a good idea but you need to do a bit of work on your own too. as i said please review your current situation and see if there is anything that might be causing you some stress or where you have neglected yourself in terms of diet sleep or social activities. all of these are vital to maintain our physical and mental health. i would also suggest that you begin engaging in some self-help techniques such as relaxation breathing mild exercise and positive self talk.

although supplement companies will claim their vitamins will help balance hormones the evidence regarding this is lacking. first off a lot depends on why your estrogen is low. if it is because of peri-menopause or menopause you want to be sure you are getting enough calcium (through diet is recommended over supplements) and vitamin d for bone health which can decrease with lower levels of estrogen. look at your diet. try to eat healthier by including plenty of fruits vegetables whole grains low fat dairy healthy fats and lean protein (including fish twice a week). if there are gaps in your diet then consider supplementing. for example if you don't eat fish you may want to consider omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil). vitamin d is tough to get through food so supplementation is usually needed. if you are concerned about it see a registered dietitian who can help you sort through the proper diet and supplementation. you can find one in your area at eatright. org. also see: the 7 missing nutrients in your diet

i generally recommend holding off on introducing cereal until 6 months of age. 3 wk olds who drink breastmilk will want to eat every 1. 5 to 2. 5 hours and those who are formula fed eat every 2. 5 to 3. 5 hours. that usually feels to a parent like they are not sleeping much and eating a lot. . in general i would enourage you to stick to breastmilk or formual at this point and feed on demand. .

head lice have not killed anyone but they are public enemy number one in the school system. just the mention of head lice will make you scratch (i bet you are thinking about scratching your head right now). head lice are just trying to survive so they find a nice person to adopt so they can feed on their blood. yes head lice are vampires â they drink tiny amounts of human blood but fortunately they do not carry diseases. lice mature quickly and are quite prolific in the sex department. lice lay dozens of eggs (nits); eggs that quickly hatch in order to perpetuate their species. as you read this blog lice may be drinking blood and having sex on your scalp right now! now you can scratch your head. it is this hysteria about head lice that drive parents and teachers crazy. school systems have adopted questionable no-nit policies banning kids from walking through the doors if any suspicious white specks are spotted on their scalp. schools must have a team of nit nazis. insects are taking over our world. actually insects outnumber us astronomically so really we are guests in their world. dogs get fleas so we spend millions on ways to eradicate them. termites are eating our homes. flies are landing on our dinner plate. ants and cockroaches show up at night to wander our kitchen looking for morsels and crumbs. bedbugs are now permanent residents in many fine hotels. kids â even the cleanest kids from the cleanest homes â can get head lice. i know. my long-haired daughter brought some home many years ago. girls are much more social and get head lice more often than boys. i often see sesame-seed sized nits on my little patients. it is rare that i see a live louse scurrying around but i have seen those as well. i do tend to take a little perverted pleasure in informing a well-coiffed snooty mother that her little angel is crawling with bugs. your daughter has head lice.  what! are you sure? could it be something else?  no. she seems to be harboring a vibrant colony of california scalp-crickets also known as the common cootie. you probably have them too.  like most of the species on earth head lice have adapted to treatments which range from insecticides like permithrin products (like nix) malathion and sulfa antibiotics to the newly-tested stromectal â a pill containing ivermectin a drug used to prevent heartworms in dogs. people do prefer pills to messy hair products but a heartworm medicine seems like an overkill. petroleum jelly mayonnaise and olive oil are sometimes used in an attempt to suffocate head lice but these treatments have not been proven to be effective. too bad since a kid with a scalp full of mayonnaise or vaseline is so attractive. there is a lice-smothering product called ulesfia that does seem to work well as long as the peta people dont know you are killing innocent lice. my late grandmother mother of 15 and self-taught research pharmacologist used kerosene. once you kill off the live lice and their egg offspring the next job is to manually remove the nits. there are all sorts of finetooth nit combs out there and a few substances that claim to dissolve the epoxy-like glue that attaches lice eggs to the hair shaft but in the end adults end up just picking them out one at a time. there may be an evolving market for trained baboons to pick out the eggs and eat them. lice do not respect social status so anyone can get them. if your kids bring them home from school then you will need to go to def con 4. the recommendation is to clean everything that can logically be cleaned; however lice do not exist very long off of the human scalp. vacuum the carpets and mattresses but again lice do not fly and travel too far from the home scalp. it is not necessary to burn down the house and move.
well it's certainly not a situation anyone wants to be in. extremely low blood sugar levels can lead to coma  which isn't a good outcome. the quickest remedy for a very low blood sugar level is. sugar. in the hospital we administer dextrose via iv line. assuming you're awake and alert and realize your blood sugar has dipped you can eat a sugary treat such as a small candy bar to bring your sugar level back up. note: no one should attempt to feed sugar to an unconscious or unresponsive person even if you know low blood sugar is the cause. you should call 9-1-1 or your local emergency number instead. of course it's not a good idea to ever let your blood sugar level get too low. one goal of diabetes management is to maintain blood sugar within a therapeutic range. for adults that might be between 70 and 13 milligrams/deciliter (mg/dl). you should try to avoid peaks and valleys in your blood sugar levels. that said if you go around measuring your blood sugar every hour you're going to find you do indeed have some peaks and valleys throughout the day. that's normal. you should measure your blood sugar at the appropriate times and eat a balanced diet that includes several healthy snacks throughout the day to keep your blood sugar as level as possible. if you have any questions about diabetes management ask your doctor or your diabetes nurse educator. they're the experts who can give you all the specific information you need for your personal health situation. wishing you well!

"it would be highly unlikely to transmit chlamydia from a toilet seat (unless there was fresh discharge on the seat itself) and next to impossible through a bath. i don't know if you are male or female but why do you have chlamydia? this is a very treatable infectious disease. one you have been properly treated and tested ""negative"" at the end of the treatment you no longer have chlamydia and cannot transmit it to anyone. chlamydia is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium chlamydia trachomatis. the infection spreads through vaginal. anal or oral sex and not by touching or sharing surfaces like toilet seats or baths. very rarely if body secretions of infected person come in immediate and direct contact with mucous membrane of other persons chlamydia may get transmitted. chlamydia can be effectively treated with antibiotics."
what type of exercise are you referring to? strength training sessions should last no more than one hour ideally 30-40 minutes if done properly. cardio should last no more than 30 minutes if done as hiit (high intensity interval training). anything over this daily would probably lead to overtraining.
yes and no. it depends on the type of test. azo is a bright orange dye that discolors the urine. on office dipstick-type urine tests there are about a dozen different tests on those dipsticks that can be done but these must be read on a color scale. fluorescent-orange urine can interfere with the readings. a microscopic test or urine culture would not be effected by discoloration.
you probably won't find it. it most likely was black tar that used to be sold in metal containers. as a grandfather myself i remember this from my youth. you can use hot water compresses for the same effect. there is an ointment you can get from your pharmacist. it looks like the black tar but has a different name. it is kept behind the counter and works wonders. the black tar salve that you are talking about is called ichthammol ointment 20%. walgreen pharmacy has it. it works wonders.
hi now is the time to go see your doctor asap best advice. good luck

abraxane could harm the fetus when given to a pregnant woman. women should avoid becoming pregnant while they are undergoing treatment with abraxane. tell your doctor if you become pregnant or plan to become pregnant while taking abraxane. men should be advised not to father a child while receiving treatment with abraxane. because studies have shown the active agent (paclitaxel) in abraxane to be present in the breast milk of animals receiving the active agent it may be present in human breast milk as well. therefore nursing a baby while taking abraxane is not recommended. because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants it is recommended that nursing be discontinued when receiving abraxane therapy. this medicine was prescribed for your particular condition. this summary does not include everything there is to know about abraxane. medicines are sometimes prescribed for purposes other than those listed in a patient information leaflet. if you have questions or concerns or want more information about abraxane contact your doctor or pharmacist. you may want to read the patient information leaflet and discuss it with your doctor. remember no written summary can replace careful discussion with your doctor.
"a recent study published in the british medical journal by russell viner at the ucl institute of child health london england. caught my eye: childhood protection and obesity: framework for practice. "" i know that my colleagues across the pond have been quite aggressive about finding creative solutions for countering the childhood obesity epidemic in england. their academy of pediatrics has recently proposed a ban on junk food and beverage tv ads aimed at kids a stiff tax on sugary items and a requirement that fast food restaurants be located far away from schools. but this bmj analysis takes the discussion to a different and understandably more contentious place. should parents be blamed for their childs obesity? intrigued i did some homework to share with you. the childhood obesity-child protection issue has emerged over the past several years garnering increased media and professional attention. at the 2007 british medical associations annual meeting members rejected a motion in which obesity occurring in kids under 12 constituted a reason to charge parents with neglect and removal of the child into protective custody. this action followed on the heels of a bbc survey of 50 pediatricians who noted that childhood obesity had been a factor in at least 20 child protection cases in 2006. the uk is not alone in its concerns which are evident internationally including us courts which have already been removing some obese children from parents considered neglectful. heres an example from missouri where an boy was removed from his foster home because his foster father was obese. the bmj authors examined the existing literature on childhood obesity and protective actions and suggested a blueprint for action. what they found is that there is indeed evidence of an association between obesity and sexual abuse violence and neglect. however there is no data on the relationship between child protection actions and weight control in the long term. moreover theres no information about the long-term physical and mental welfare of an obese child who undergoes removal from the home and placement into foster care. the bmj authors note that obesity is part of a larger constellation of child welfare concerns related to child protection. this means that all aspects of the childs family and living environment including nutrition and activity need to be closely assessed when determining whats best for the childs welfare. to further complicate things there is good research that shows even when obese children have strong family support or ready access to credible weight-loss programs kids can still struggle to remove the pounds. they suggest that failure to comply with obesity treatment (missing appointments not supporting obese children with weight management programs or even actively sabotaging their kids' efforts) is tantamount to neglect especially in those kids who are already suffering medical consequences arising from their obesity. in reviewing the media coverage on this topic its clear that the brits are more open to aggressive legal actions especially for children under 12. they see it as an issue of extreme overfeeding which they believe constitutes abuse. they argue that malnutrition and starvation of a child results in immediate court interventions so why not obesity? but the royal college of paediatrics and child health has continued to argue that obesity is a public health problem not a child protection issue. the bottom line is that this is a very complex and controversial issue. the real goal is to protect children from serious harm. most pediatricians have gone on record noting that the majority of parents do care about their children but may not be knowledgeable about how to do it. that means that every parent must be a role model for their children by walking the talk and creating a healthy living environment for the whole family. doctors and all medical care providers are also role models and mentors who need to provide counseling education and programs for parents to help obese children and their families."
spotting is us usually just very small amounts of pink or red-blood from the vagina or uterus. woman have normal discharges from the vagina as well but anything that is not pink or red but clear or yellow heavy really slimy and smelly could be a vaginal yeast infection. usually with a yeast infection there is itching but not always. periods are different from one woman to the next some have heavy flow and some have light some last from a couple of days to a week. you are not bleeding when you have a period only shedding of the lining of the uterus which was the bodies way of preparing for a pregnancy. if you have bloody discharge that resembles coffee grinds you need to see a physician asap as this could indicate a severe problem. i had this years ago when suffering from an ectopic pregnancy: means pregnancy outside of the uterus. it was very bad and i needed blood transfusion. spotting is sometimes normal during pregnancy and should always be discussed with your doctor right away it could indicate a miscarriage.

current home pregnancy tests (hpts) are advertised to be sensitive on the first day of a missed periodâor perhaps a few days before. in the most recent review of accuracy of hpts published in august of 2011 such claims were tested. one brand first responseÂ® detected 97% of pregnancies on the first day of a missed period. the eptÂ® manual (54%) and digital (67%); and the clear blueÂ® manual (64%) and digital (54%) tests all detected fewer actual pregnancies. these results may reflect that the first responseÂ® could detect as little as 5. 5 miu/ml of hcg in the urine while the other two brands could detect 22 miu/ml. generally speaking a reliable pregnancy test in a doctors office should be able to detect a level of 22 units of hcg or higher. remember it takes an implantation to produce hcg to trigger a test. in a study where day of implantation was documented with a sensitive blood test it was determined that 10% of viable pregnancies were not yet implanted by the first day of the missed period! having read all this you can now understand why a gyn may recommend using a hpt twice if the first instance is at the time of missed flow. about 97% of viable pregnancies will have implanted by seven days after the first day of missed menses. taking a second reading can also enhance accuracy where your hpt is not one of the super-sensitive brands.
a cardiac cause for chest discomfort and pain should be ruled out primarily. one should have a very low threshold for it. a baseline ekg should be done just to be on the safe side. based on your description its unlikely to be a cardiac cause. if the chest pain is involving chest wall tenderness then costochondritis is the likely cause and would only require nsaids like ibuprofen for treatment. wishing you best of health thanks

if you are planning outdoor activities check weather forecasts frequently and don't ignore warnings about storms and other inclement conditions. avoid sports activities  such as hiking or camping in freezing weather  that are beyond your experience level. also: wear adequate clothing. thomas tallman do staff physician emergency services institute cleveland clinic recommends wearing several layers of clothing with the innermost layer being a fabric that wicks moisture from the skin. the outer layer should serve as a windbreaker. mittens provide more protection than gloves. wearing two pairs of socks is advised with wool recommended for the outer later. and don't forget a hat and scarf that covers the ears. get moving. increasing physical activity will help your body stay warm. wiggle fingers and toes if they start to feel numb. don't drink alcohol before or during cold weather exposure since alcohol may prevent you from realizing that your body is becoming too cold. don't smoke. smoking constricts blood vessels and increases the risk for frostbite.
you will need to specifically ask this question to your medical provider  someone who knows the details of your medical history.

if your doctor was not able to find a reason for your ear pain and hearing changes then you need to see an ent specialist for a higher-level examination. tmj and bruxism (grinding the teeth) doesn't cause hearing loss but it can cause ear pain. many dentists now specialize in tmj disorders so finding one would be quite helpful in tracking down the reasons. ear pain can be caused by infection or referred pain from other head and neck areas like your throat lymph nodes salivary glands cervical spine tonsils (if you have them) sinuses and nerve disorders. just because one doctor could not find a cause does not mean a second medical provider like an ent will have the same conclusion.

most helpful answer having your husband or a trusted female friend would be great. talk to you women friends too. having someone with you will make you feel safer. t may not be the exam. but the examiner so consider getting a female nurse practitioner or pa or find a very kind and compassionate gynecologist. to many unfortunately this intimate exam is so routine. almost like a dentist looking in your mouth. that they may not take the time and care to do it gently. again ask your friends for a referral to someone they find to be helpful. your primary care medical provider can give you a short-acting anti-anxiety medication if you ask. something like xanax at a low-dose may be helpful. look deep inside yourself to see if there was a stressful event in the past that may be surfacing when you are having a gynecological exam. if so a counselor may be able to help you deal with this very specific anxiety.
crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestines. it primarily causes ulcerations (breaks in the lining) of the small and large intestines but can affect the digestive system anywhere from the mouth to the anus. it is named after the physician who described the disease in 1932. it also is called granulomatous enteritis or colitis regional enteritis ileitis or terminal ileitis. crohn's disease is related closely to another chronic inflammatory condition that involves only the colon called ulcerative colitis. together crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are frequently referred to as inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). ulcerative colitis and crohn's disease have no medical cure. once the diseases begin they tend to fluctuate between periods of inactivity (remission) and activity (relapse). they affect approximately 500 000 to 2 million people in the united states. men and women are equally affected. ibd most commonly begins during adolescence and early adulthood but it also can begin during childhood and later in life. crohn's disease tends to be more common in relatives of patients with crohn's disease. it also is more common among relatives of patients with ulcerative colitis.
i'm sorry to hear you're in pain. the good news is once the gallbladder's been removed it can never cause you a problem again. the gallbladder cannot grow back. the pain you are experiencing might feel a lot like the old gallbladder pain but it's definitely something else. the thing is the body isn't all that great about pinpointing the source of pain. this means your pain could be coming from anywhere in the same region as your gallbladder used to be. i suggest you see a doctor for further evaluation. he or she might want to check your liver your pancreas or even your intestines. any of these structures (and many others) could cause pain similar to that of gallstones. the only way you'll know for sure is with a physical examination. wishing you well!
the threat of suicide among patients with bipolar disorder is very real  and it can occur during either the depressive or the manic state. stress as well as personal traumatic events can also increase the risk. up to 15% of people with bipolar disorder are successful in their suicide attempts  and many more try. although treatment reduces risks friends and family members should be on the lookout for signs of impending suicide. these include talking about suicide or death; writing a suicide note; talking about feelings of hopelessness; abusing drugs or alcohol; participating in life-threatening activities. during a crisis do not leave a person with bipolar disorder alone and remove car keys weapons or large amounts of medication. call 911 for assistance.

the only way to lose weight is to take in fewer calories than you burn. a vegetarian diet doesnt necessarily mean you will lose weight. a lot of very fattening foods are vegetarian such as desserts french fries candy and snack bars. usually deciding to be a vegetarian is more about a philosophy than losing weight. the basics of achieving and maintaining a healthy weight are the same for vegetarians and nonvegetarians; you need to count your calories and exercise. lean meats are healthier and lower in calories than meats that are fatty. talk to the butcher in your grocery store about which are the leaner meats. beef that is labeled prime choice or select is usually lower in fat. leaner cuts of beef include tenderloin round and sirloin. ground beef for hamburgers will have the percentage of lean meat on the label so choose those with 90% or higher lean meat. for chicken buy the white meat from the breast and take off the skin. fish is another great alternative to lean meats to get high quality protein. cod flounder haddock salmon tilapia trout and tuna are excellent choices. seafood is another alternative and includes shrimp scallops lobster and crab. the best diet is one that you can stick with. limiting your food choices isnt necessary to lose weight. take the good from each diet plan. try to include dried beans used in vegetarian diets into several meals per week. they are a great source of protein and are loaded with fiber. put yourself on an exercise plan to help with weight loss. remember that losing weight slowly is healthier. learning to eat healthy is a lifestyle change and it doesnt happen overnight.

exercise during pregnancy is generally considered safe for most healthy women and can even relieve some of the discomforts of pregnancy. some forms of exercise that are particularly good for pregnant women are walking swimming stationary cycling and yoga. wear loose-fitting lightweight clothing get plenty of fluids and don't work to the point of exhaustion. when you reach your second and third trimesters don't do exercises that require lying on your back and never do workouts that pose a risk of trauma to your abdomen while pregnant. and always be sure to check with your doctor about any exercise program before getting started. some women  such as those with preeclampsia preterm labor and hypertension or heart disease  may be advised not to exercise or to pursue very limited physical activities while pregnant.

an epileptic seizure is a sudden and transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms that are the result of abnormal activity in the brain. epileptic seizures are the common and defining component of the disorder that is referred to as epilepsy. the diagnosis of epilepsy implies that there is an abnormality in the brain and that this abnormality will result in more epileptic seizures. that is an individual who has an isolated seizure as a result of an acute transient insult to the brain for example a metabolic disorder or a seizure observed after an acute trauma to the brain would not be diagnosed as having epilepsy. in other words epilepsy is the tendency to have repeated spontaneous seizures.
i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. but i have good news: your problem probably can be fixed. it's not uncommon for women to develop bladder leakage especially after having children. the leakage (or in your case gushing) can be caused by several things from a prolapsed bladder to a weak bladder muscle. your health care provider can diagnose the cause of your bladder leakage and suggest the appropriate treatment which can range from medication to an outpatient surgical procedure. i suggest you make an appointment with your gynecologist or primary healthcare provider to have this problem diagnosed. you've suffered long enough! best wishes to you!

the only way to monitor your sodium intake is to keep track of how much sodium you eat by reading food labels. food labels will tell you how much sodium (in mg) a serving of that product contains. and you can use that information to calculate your overall sodium intake for the day. most of the salt in our diets comes from eating too many prepared or processed foods like canned or frozen foods. try to choose fresh homemade foods wherever possible. beware of restaurant foods that are often laden with sodium.
"not all swollen joints are treated the same way. for example, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are used in treating swollen joints with osteoarthritis. nsaids may also be used to treat swollen joints from an injury. along with nsaids, applications of moist heat or ice can help ease swollen joints and pain."

hi. if a woman has a cycle of 28 days then on about 14th [1st day is counted as the day when bleeding starts] day the egg releases. so the period between 12th to 20th day is most favourable. your friend had intercourse during that period only and there are chances of pregnancy. but if she has a severe bleed then it is not probably pregnancy. so for confirmation she should get her hcg levels checked by a blood test and also get an ultrasound done. hope this helps.
sorry to hear this. it's tough to tell what's going on here without more information. for example did you suffer a trauma (slam your finger in the car door? ) or has this condition been coming on gradually? regardless if you're running a fever; start to experience nausea or vomiting; have difficulty opening your mouth chewing or swallowing; or experience difficulty breathing you should seek medical attention. these could all be signs of a serious infection that requires rapid treatment. otherwise i'd suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider to have this checked out. whatever is occurring it's not normal and needs to be addressed. hope this helps!
most cases of chickenpox are relatively mild and run their course in five to 10 days. but it can cause life-threatening complications in infants adults and people with weakened immune systems. before the varicella vaccine was licensed in the u. s. in 1995 there were approximately 100 deaths and more than 11 000 hospitalizations a year from chickenpox. most of the people who died were healthy before they got chickenpox. additionally the illness is highly contagious and can be spread by direct contact or through the air by sneezing or coughing. also someone can get it by coming in contact with fluid from chickenpox blisters.

you will need a urine specimen. many labs will allow you do this without a doctor's order but you can also confide in the pediatrician and allow him or her to order the proper test. this is a very serious problem so it is important that you disclose this to a professional since the safety of your child is paramount. knowing the suspected drug would be helpful since drug tests do not test for all drugs.
hi i recommend you see a gynecologist for possible ovarian cysts ultrasonography is recommended. good luck
if you have high blood pressure it is usually advised that you avoid cold medicines that contain a decongestant like pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine because they can raise the blood pressure and heart rate in some people. your pharmacist can help you choose a cold medicine that will help your symptoms and mix well with your prescription medications.

if his gonorrhea is untreated and it was in his mouth then maybe but most men with gonorrhea will have it in their genital tract. it is quite painful which motivates they to get prompt treatment. you may need to get more information but it is not very likely that a little kiss will transmit gonorrhea to you. a good rule of thumb: don't kiss someone with gonorrhea because you don't know who he has been kissing. clearly someone gave him gonorrhea.
the female condom is about 75% effective.
4 anchors are ideal if your tear was a large one. medium tears can be sutured strongly with 3 anchors. we need to know the size of the tear that you had before the surgery to comment on the surgical procedure. about the broken anchor if its embedded strongly in the bone and is immobile then do not worry. only if it loosens it needs attention and subsequent removal

although symptoms of atopic dermatitis can be very difficult and uncomfortable the disease can be successfully managed. people with atopic dermatitis as well as their families can lead healthy normal lives. longterm management may include treatment with an allergist to control internal allergies and a dermatologist to monitor the skin care component.
"cold medications are rarely used in this age group. infant colds are typically treated with saline nasal drops with mucous aspiration using a bulb syringe and a cool mist humidifier. if a one month old is having a fever seems to be worsening or ""can't breathe"" as you stated it would be wise to seek medical care. colds in a one month old with their immature immune systems can lead to more serious complications like pneumonia. in most cases however colds are simply annoying and self-limiting."
this is typically a problem called keratosis pilaris. this is a genetic problem that we see in people. it can just happen. sometimes you grow into it sometimes you grow out of it. but also i tend to see it in people who have either personal or family histories of asthma or allergies. it's not something that we can cure but we can help control it. using products like urea or lactic acid or exfoliants this can help smooth the skin and make it softer. so scratching and picking at it obviously will make it worse and will make it more red will make it likely to last longer. scrubs can help to some effect. retinoids have not been very effective for this but using products that are called keratolytics; something that will help the skin cells turn over more effectively can help it dramatically. for some people it's worse in the summer for some it's worse in the winter. you can sort of pick your season. if you are out in the summer and you have a short sleeve dress it's more important to try to treat it then and in the winter you can let it go if it doesn't bother you. but it's not a harmful condition it's more of a nuisance.
no it does not. there are no rules in medicine that state a person can only have one medical issue at a time so you can have both but they are not related.
we scientists don't fully understand the process of female ejaculation. it seems that some women sometimes release fluids that range from clear to white-ish during sexual excitement and/or orgasm. some women can consciously do this. others find it beyond their control. some women and their partners enjoy it and others feel bothered by it. because the fluid comes from the urethra (which is the same tube that pee passes though - just as men's ejaculate also passes through their urethra) it may feel like urine. it may even smell just a little bit like it as it does pass through the same tube. .
an allergic reaction is often sudden hives that are very pruritic (itchy). an amoxicillin side effect usually occurs near the end of the course of treatment (day 8-10 not day three) and is bright red occuring all over the body. this does not usually itch. so. it could be either one. i don't have enough specific information and the ability to examine your baby to offer you a definitive answer.
this is a hot topic right now. i think what a lot of consumers and patients didn't realize is that acetaminophen is also known as tylenol over-the-counter or apap. in prescription medications it's also included. so we had a lot of people taking two medications that contained a lot of tylenol and exceeding what we call the daily dose. if you are a healthy adult. you don't want to exceed more than 4000 milligrams a day. in the elderly we recommend 2000 milligrams a day. we also found out that a lot of people were taking it too many times a day not following the directions on the box. so we really want to make sure that people understand it's important to take it as directed as per the instructions on the box. if you ever have any questions about the dosing come and talk to the pharmacist we will be more than happy to help you with that. we also want to make sure that you don't drink any alcohol while taking these products. and that you also want to avoid alcohol containing products. some cough syrups still contain alcohol and it's usually just enough that with the tylenol in the alcohol it actually causes an elevation in your liver enzymes. we see this a lot sometimes with people who have the flu. they tend to not feel well they are taking a lot of cold medicines on top of tylenol for their fever and there has been some emergency room admissions where peoples liver enzymes were elevated just from a few days of doing this. so that is the reason why it's a hot topic right now.
"the cause of your acne that is worsening is not as important as the treatment. cystic acne is the type most likely to scar and most likely to need the services of a good dermatologist. there are some wonderful medications available that can get your acne in control. at age 15 both male and females have ""ranging hormones"" which is really the number one cause; a cause that cannot be rectified at this time in your life since your hormones are providing some other essential functions right now. if you are female certain oral contraceptives can help regulate those zit-causing female hormones. for men there are no options to regulate testosterone; the male hormone. think of your acne as a temporary side-effect."
pregnancy tests can detect a baby very early now. what it does is detect hcg in the woman which is a hormone that is present during pregnancy. it is rare for a pregnancy test to have false positives. a pregnancy test can have a false negative if the hcg hormone is not yet detectable.

hemorrhagic strokes happen when there's bleeding in your brain that damages nearby cells. the most common causes are:
influenza is contagious a day before you know you have it and about two days later (estimate). tamiful is given for five days and must be given in the first two days of an influenza infection so you are about a week into this illness at least. that is assuming you were accurately diagnosed. i do not believe that you would be contagious at this point. besides your one-year old grandson should have been immunized for influenza. it is offered at age six months.
swollen neck lymph nodes may be the result of an infection inflammation cancer or viruses. in your case it is suspected that your recent cold is the cause of the enlarged neck lymph node. treatment is dependent on the cause with bacterial infections possibly needing antibiotics a virus needing to run its course and cancers being attacked with multiple individualized treatments. the link below will access a webmd article on the topic of lymph nodes. 
make him comfortable with some acetaminophen (tylenol) but don't fret about the fever. a fever is the body's way of fighting off an infection and your child is the perfect age to get his first experience with illness (the maternal immunity protects him (her? ) for the first 5-6 months. then the baby is on their own fighting off the bugs in our environment. he will average about 6-9 of these fever episodes every year now so you will become more skilled and comfortable with fevers i can assure you. five month olds are irresistibly cute so they tend to get exposed. a side effect of smiling at people who just can't resist picking them up and touching them. a fever can also be a sign of things like ear infections so if you are the least-bit concerned or if he is having other symptoms that you failed to include in your posting just have him examined by a medical professional.
most helpful answer based on your description here it does sound like you could be having migraines. a visual disturbance prior to the headache is a common symptom of migraine. other symptoms can include: sensitivity to light or noise nausea or vomiting feeling unusually hot or cold dizziness and that's just a short list. not everyone who gets a migraine will experience all of these symptoms. because you said this has happened to you twice i'd suggest consulting a medical professional. you can start with your primary care provider. while the symptoms you're describing can indeed be caused by migraine your health care provider will want to rule out any other potential causes. if it does turn out you're experiencing migraines your doctor can provide you with treatment options. sorry you're going through this. headaches of any kind can be a miserable experience!
if you shave all of the hair from your body how in the world would they get a hair sample in order to test your for cannabis use? i suspect that after six weeks of abstinence from weed that your drug test would be fine but then again i have no idea how they will test you or the sensitivity of the lab doing the testing. hair samples can show evidence of past drug use so you will just have to take that chance. as an employer or medical provider i would be equally suspicious of a man coming in without a bit of hair. what are they hiding?
i am surprised at the fact that you have all these diagnosis. and test results. but have not been treated for the symptoms. it may just be a urinary tract infection. i would revisit the dr. who gave you this imformation and results from your test. and tell him or her that the problem still persist.
this is of course abnormal communication disorder. and he may be having some autistic features based on your description that needs to be diagnosed abd managed with a psychiatrist. it is still early to be worried. but early intervention will improve his development faster

any patient-specific treatment instructions should be done by the medical provider who is caring for you but if you do not need the pain relief from vicodin now you can switch to ibuprofen at any time if your doctor is okay with it. the vicodin will not be bio-effective after six hours or so so anytime after that.

"i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. osteomyelitis is no fun that's for sure! the only way you'll find out the answer to your question is to ask. somnolence (sleepiness) is one of the main side effects of opioid pain relievers like morphine and oxycodone. often the first treatment for excessive somnolence in opioid users is to reduce the dosage. if that's impossible in your case then your doctor may consider prescribing something to offset the drowsiness. if you're experiencing severe sleepiness due to opioid use you need to be extremely careful about driving cooking (for example using knives or a food processor) operating machinery or any tasks that require keen awareness. you also need to make sure you're not so highly medicated that your breathing slows or stops. regularly check your lips to make sure they don't have a bluish tint around the edges and make sure your finger nailbeds stay pink as well. if you see any bluishness around your mouth or in your nailbeds you should contact your doctor right away as these can be signs of an accidental opioid overdose. i just want to add that your pain should not keep you ""bedridden. "" you should do everything you can to stay active whether this means using crutches a cane or even a wheelchair. but don't stay in bed because then you're putting yourself at risk for a blood clot. and you don't need that on top of everything else! good luck to you!"
most helpful answer although the medication she is on often decreases appetite it can increase appetite in some people. i would visit a pediatric dietitian for an evaluation to make sure nothing else is going on. you can find a dietitian near you at eatright. org. in the meantime here are some things you can do at home: structure meals and snacks at the table and don't allow grazing between meals. provide a variety of food groups at meals (2-3 at snack and 4-5 at meals) especially protein rich foods and fiber (fruits vegetables whole grains beans) that help increase feelings of fullness. allow treats but provide them less often. encourage her to listen to feeling so fullness and remind her she can have more food at the next meal etc. allow at least an hour of day for physical activity. good luck!

doctors do not know why certain hair follicles are programmed to have a shorter growth period than others. although a person's level of androgens  male hormones normally produced by both men and women  is believed to be a factor hair loss has nothing to do with virility. an individual's genes however  from both male and female parents  unquestionably influence that person's predisposition to male or female pattern baldness. telogen effluvium is temporary hair loss that can occur within a few months after a high fever a severe illness or extreme stress and in women following childbirth. drugs that can cause temporary hair loss include chemotherapy drugs used in cancer treatment blood thinners retinoids used to treat acne and other skin problems beta-adrenergic blockers used to control blood pressure and birth control pills. hair loss can also be caused by burns x-rays and scalp injuries. in such cases normal hair growth usually returns once the cause is eliminated. ringworm caused by a fungal infection can also cause hair loss. the causes of alopecia areata a disease that often strikes children or teenagers remain unexplained. it is thought to be an autoimmune disease meaning that the immune system revs up for unknown reasons and affects the hair follicles. in most cases the hair grows back although it may be very fine and possibly a different color before normal coloration and thickness return. although shampooing too often perms bleaching and dyeing hair do not cause baldness they can contribute to overall thinning by making hair weak and brittle. tight braiding and using rollers or hot curlers can damage and break hair and running hair picks through tight curls can scar hair follicles. in most instances hair grows back normally if the source of the problem is removed but severe damage to the hair or scalp sometimes causes permanent bald patches.
that is a question that only your dentist can answer. waiting a year being toothless is not something that anyone would want to do. i really have no idea if you can wait a year. some medical and dental problems precede our insurance. you couldn't wait a year with appendicitis so you may not be able to wait a year before you have the proper insurance.

age-related cognitive decline. as people age they usually experience slower information processing and mild memory impairment. in addition their brains frequently decrease in volume and some nerve cells or neurons are lost. these changes called age-related cognitive decline are normal and are not considered signs of dementia. mild cognitive impairment. some people develop cognitive and memory problems that are not severe enough to be diagnosed as dementia but are more pronounced than the cognitive changes associated with normal aging. this condition is called mild cognitive impairment. although many patients with this condition later develop dementia some do not. many researchers are studying mild cognitive impairment to find ways to treat it or prevent it from progressing to dementia. depression. people with depression are frequently passive or unresponsive and they may appear slow confused or forgetful. other emotional problems can also cause symptoms that sometimes mimic dementia. delirium. delirium is characterized by confusion and rapidly altering mental states. the person may also be disoriented drowsy or incoherent and may exhibit personality changes. delirium is usually caused by a treatable physical or psychiatric illness such as poisoning or infections. patients with delirium often though not always make a full recovery after their underlying illness is treated.

"i have a hernia that will be repaired in about 3 weeks and personally have not had an issue with this. however my doctor has told me and i have read that sometimes the vas deferens can become strangulated by the intestine intruding into the scrotum. the ""vas"" is the tube that carries the sperm. if you are having trouble and you think it may be related to your hernia see your doctor immediately as a strangulation of any kind can be very serious. read some of the categories relating to strangulation."
most helpful answer yes you can get infected with certain types of worms by eating raw or improperly cooked smoked marinated or salted fish. these worms can be found in herring mackerel north american salmon cod halibut rockfish sardines and squid. after eating improperly prepared fish these worms invade the intestinal wall or lining of the stomach. an infection in humans can cause stomach pain nausea and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea within a few hours of eating fish. freezing fish at -20Â°c (-4Â°f) for at least five days kills the worm and makes sushi safe for eating.

when you and your child's doctor have determined that your child needs to lose weight a serious attempt to treat the problem should be undertaken. here are some tips to get you started. set goals. just like with adult weight loss the weight loss goals in children should be attainable allowing for normal growth. the goals should initially be small so that the child doesn't become discouraged or overwhelmed. a five to 10 pound weight loss is a reasonable first goal  about 1 to 4 pounds per month. food diary. work with your child to keep a food diary. this should include not just the type and quantity of food eaten but where it was eaten and who else was present. the diary is not meant to help calculate calories eaten. rather it is useful in determining eating patterns and problem foods. diet. work with your child's doctor to ensure that your child is receiving a balanced diet even if the calories consumed are decreased. consider working with a dietitian also. physical activity. exercise is an essential component for any long-term weight loss. start small to avoid discouraging the child and work up to 20 to 30 minutes of moderate activity per day in addition to what they get in school. behavior modification. it's important to help your child learn the skills to modify the behaviors that may be causing the weight problem. consider sending your child to a nutritional counselor. parental role. help your child by limiting the amount of fattening foods in the house eating all meals at the dinner table at designated times and discouraging second helpings.
"you're smart to consider the ramifications of stopping a medication like trazodone. in general i always urge people to consult their doctor before they discontinue taking any medication. your doctor might be able to answer your question about the dry mouth issue without your going through the hassle of stopping a valuable medication. if you decide to stop the tramadol anyway then your physician can tell you the best way to do it. you certainly do not want to abruptly stop taking it. you also can consult a pharmacist for more information on this. it's worth noting trazodone is an antidepressant medication not a pain medication. trazodone is often prescribed for sleep problems even though it is not a ""sleep aid "" per se. if back pain is causing you to have sleep problems then it might be worthwhile to explore treating the cause of the pain instead of treating the insomnia. wishing you well!"
hi see the answer above.
"an exposure to an infectious disease like chicken pox does not make you a ""carrier"". you actually have to have the disease or at least staged to get the disease (at the end of an incubation period) to be able to transmit it to others. if you had chicken pox (varicella) as a child you are most likely immune but any new exposure could cause a reactivation of this latent herpes virus and cause you to get shingles (herpes zoster). have you had the shingles vaccine? because of your exposure to children this may be something for you to discuss with your medical provider."
most helpful answer yes continue taking your antibiotic as prescribed by your medical provider. call the medical provider for a separate treatment for your thrush.
there can be numerous reasons for your failure to conceive and those reasons may have nothing to do with your long-term use of oral contraceptives at all. every couple is uniquely different in these matters but five months is really not long enough to be overly concerned. many fertility specialists will have you wait a year but i know you are anxious. you can consult with a fertility specialist now perhaps starting with a simple semen analysis of your husband.
it doesnt seem like anyone really knows exactly why some people yawn during or after exercise but there are some theories. one thought is that you may be trying to get more oxygen. think about what a yawn actually is; a long deep breath of air. this deep breath may serve as a means to get more oxygen into your body which makes sense because exercise can make your body oxygen-deprived. yawning can also increase heart rate and blood pressure helping to increase the cardiac output that your heart might need during exercise. some research suggests that yawning could actually provide a cooling effect as a way to regulate your core body temperature after exercise as well. of course you may just be yawning because youre fatigued or sleep deprived or it could be a side effect of some medications too. there really isnt one single answer as to why we yawn during or after exercise. excessive yawning may be the sign of an underlying health condition however so please consult your doctor for further guidance.
in my opinion you would be having anaemia and dehydration as a common post delivery complication drink plenty of fluids and get a cbc done do u have fever?

an otherwise healthy person who gets the flu will usually improve over two to five days. in some people that tired feeling may last for one week or more and very rarely the symptoms can last for several weeks (post influenza asthenia). a major concern when you get the flu is that complications can arise. this is not strictly a relapse but the development of another illness. the risk is highest for those with diabetes; heart lung or kidney disease; and other chronic diseases that lower the body's resistance to infection. persons over age 65 are also at greater risk of developing complications from the flu. a very serious complication associated with the flu is pneumonia. shortness of breath sharp chest pain on deep breathing or fever lasting beyond five days are symptoms that may indicate pneumonia. talk with your doctor if your symptoms are not improving. it is always better to wait until you are feeling better before starting back on a vigorous exercise program. it is normal to feel weak for several days after the flu but if your symptoms persist seek medical attention to be safe.
"to answer your first question: no. a urine test that checks for bacteria will not ""look"" for other substances in the urine. to your second question: if you inhale a small amount of secondhand marijuana smoke might it show up on a drug screen test? i'd guess it's doubtful but not impossible. it definitely won't show up on a urine culture designed to check for bacteria. i hope that helps!"
"sometimes, a delay occurs in several developmental areas. when that happens, it's called ""global developmental delay."" it may happen because of a genetic defect such as down syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, fragile x syndrome, or severe medical problems that develop soon after birth. often, doctors don't know what the cause is."

hi the time to take a test would be on the first day of your next missed period even if you do have a period i would still have one reason it is possible for you to have periods why being pregnant. may sound a bit crazy but it can happen. good luck
i don't know. i don't know what medication you are taking so my advice to you to speak with your pharmacist.
diabetes. my answer would be controlled or not. type 1 or 2 if managed well and treated can still maintain good immunity. if either are out of control then infections of any type more likely. .
"you cannot ""catch"" cancer. it is not contagious."
it does sound to me that you very well may be suffering from hypothyroidism or at least a sluggish thyroid but it cannot be known for sure without more test results. what tests did your doctor run exactly? if he suspects it may by a thyroid issue he definitely should have ran a tsh free t3 and free t4 test at very least as well as some other tests that may will greatly improve the chances of diagnosing this correctly. without them it is hard to say because hypothyroidism can have overlapping symptoms with other disorders many of which can also be discovered through a comprehensive hormone test. i strongly recommend you getting one done if your doctor has not already.
sounds like you need to go to the doctor again. i wish you well. you might want to consider using one of those penis health cremes they have on the market nowadays. these deliver important vitamins and nutrients directly to the penis which improves its overall health. i use one called man1 man oil and it definitely helps.
no pneumonia is usually treated without the indignity and pain of an (antibiotic? ) injection. there are many types and severity of pneumonia but if they medical provider assumed that he had a bacterial type these can be effectively treated with oral antibiotics. sometimes with younger children who may be vomiting (not good candidates for oral medications) or those with severe pneumonia i will give an antibiotic injection. they are not happy about it but getting them better is the most important goal. there is a shot to prevent many types of pneumonia (pneumococcal)? i had one this morning!
there should not be any interactions. we do not have very reliable information on what is in slimquick or how safe and effective it is. as a pharmacist i generally steer my patients clear of weight-loss gimmicks.

scabies live inside of the skin so are you sure you are making a correct self-diagnosis? obviously i have no way of blindly determining what you have based solely on your posting so seeing your medical provider would seem appropriate. hydrogen peroxide is not an effective treatment for scabies.

sinus infection is most often diagnosed based on a history and examination made by a doctor. because plain x-ray studies of the sinuses may be misleading and procedures such as ct and mri scans which are much more sensitive in their ability to diagnose sinus infection are so expensive and not available in most doctors offices most cases of sinus infection are initially diagnosed and treated based on clinical findings on examination. these physical findings may include: redness and swelling of the nasal passages purulent (pus like) drainage from the nasal passages (the symptom most likely to clinically diagnose a sinus infection) tenderness to percussion (tapping) over the cheeks or forehead region of the sinuses swelling about the eyes and cheeks. occasionally nasal secretions are examined for secreted cells that may help differentiate between infectious and allergic sinusitis. infectious sinusitis may show specialized cells of infection (polymorphonuclear cells) while allergic sinusitis may show specialized cells of allergy (eosinophils). physicians prescribe antibiotics if bacterial infection is suspected. antibiotics are not effective against viral infections; many physicians then treat the symptoms. if sinus infection fails to respond to the initial treatment prescribed then more in-depth studies such as ct or mri scans may be performed. ultrasound has been used to diagnose sinus infections in pregnant women but is not as accurate as ct or mri. rhinoscopy a procedure for directly looking in the back of the nasal passages with a small flexible fiber optic tube may be used to directly look at the sinus openings (ostea) and check for obstruction of these openings by either swelling or growths. it may sometimes be necessary to perform a needle aspiration (needle puncture) of a sinus to get infected material to culture to determine what pathogen is actually causing the sinus infection. cultures of the nasal passages are rarely helpful in determining what bacteria or fungus is causing a sinus infection since the nasal passages are often colonized by non-infecting bacteria. the needle puncture procedure is usually done by an otolaryngologist when treatments have failed to alleviate the disease. the procedure is uncomfortable and requires local anesthesia; some patients require general anesthesia. the sinus is aspirated the contents sent for culture and staining and the sinus may be flushed with a saline solution. this is technically the most accurate way to diagnose infectious sinusitis. in addition both rigid and flexible endoscopy have been used to obtain diagnostic material from sinuses. unfortunately these procedures are also uncomfortable and need to be done by an otolaryngologist who may need to sedate the patient. some investigators suggest that endoscopy specimens are comparable to those obtained by needle puncture.
call or other emergency services if: a baby younger than 3 months has a high fever. you are having trouble breathing or feel very short of breath. you have a severe headache or stiff neck and are confused or having trouble staying awake. call your doctor if: you have an extremely high fever. your fever lasts for longer than 3 days. you are finding it harder and harder to breathe. wheezing develops. new pain develops or pain localizes to one area such as an ear the throat the chest or the sinuses. symptoms persist in spite of home treatment. symptoms become more severe or frequent. watchful waiting in most healthy people the flu will go away in 5 to 7 days although fatigue can last much longer. although you may feel very sick home treatment is usually all that is needed. if it is flu season you may just want to treat your symptoms at home. watch closely for symptoms of a bacterial infection such as nasal drainage that changes from clear to colored after 5 to 7 days and symptoms that return or get worse. early treatment (within 48 hours of your first symptoms) with antiviral medicines may reduce the severity of influenza and may prevent serious flu-related complications. 2 babies older adults and people who have chronic health problems are more likely to have complications from the flu and they may need to see a doctor for care beyond home treatment. but not all antiviral medicines work against all strains of the flu. talk to your doctor if you think you may need an antiviral medicine. call your doctor if you think your symptoms are caused by something other than the flu. who to see these doctors can diagnose and treat the flu: family physician internist pediatrician nurse practitioner physician assistant a doctor who specializes in treating infectious diseases may be needed if the diagnosis is not clear or if severe complications develop. to prepare for your appointment see the topic making the most of your appointment. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

no the stomach is likely in the right place and not put in backwards. talk to the surgeon. there is likely another reason you are seeing this difference.
"this is a very good question. to my knowledge there is no serious adverse reaction associated with taking famotidine with an antibiotic. however taking famotidine with an anti-fungal oral medication (such as the ones with names ending in ""azole"") can have serious side effects. taking certain antacid or anti-gerd medications like famotidine can reduce the effectiveness of other medications when taken together. thus it's a good idea to wait 1-2 hours before or after taking other medications before you take a product like famotidine. because you have finished your antibiotics (good for you! ) the real question is: do you still have symptoms of your illness? if not then you did no harm by combining the two medications. if you still feel ill then i'd suggest you go back to your primary care provider explain the situation and get evaluated to see if you need another course of antibiotics. in all likelihood everything worked out fine. at least that's my hope for you!"
if you have latent tuberculosis (tb) you do not have symptoms and cannot spread the disease to others. if you have active tb you do have symptoms and can spread the disease to others. which specific symptoms you have will depend on whether your tb infection is in your lungs (the most common site) or in another part of your body ( extrapulmonary tb ). there are other conditions with symptoms similar to tb such as pneumonia or lung cancer. symptoms of active tb in the lungs symptoms of active tb in the lungs begin gradually and develop over a period of weeks or months. you may have one or two mild symptoms and not even know that you have the disease. common symptoms include: a cough with thick cloudy and sometimes bloody mucus from the lungs ( sputum ) for more than 2 weeks. fever chills and night sweats. fatigue and weakness. loss of appetite and unexplained weight loss. shortness of breath and chest pain. symptoms of an active tb infection outside the lungs symptoms of tb outside the lungs ( extrapulmonary tb ) vary widely depending on which area of the body is infected. for example back pain can be a symptom of tb in the spine or your neck may get swollen when lymph nodes in the neck are infected. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

"you may wonder if dissociative identity disorder is real. after all, understanding the development of multiple personalities is difficult, even for highly trained experts. the diagnosis itself remains controversial among mental health professionals, with some experts believing that it is really an ""offshoot"" phenomenon of another psychiatric problem, such as borderline personality disorder, or the product of profound difficulties in coping abilities or stresses related to how people form trusting emotional relationships with others."
closed head injuries are a major issue in sports particularly with children. concussion is what we call a closed head injury and managing patients both in the initial post injury period and the ensuing days to weeks can be challenging. . as for post concussive symptoms headache concentration problems dizziness sleepiness and a whole bunch more are all symptoms that can be present. for how long is very individual. people need to be symptom free at rest before the begin resuming any exercise program or sporting activity. this is even more important in kids as they are still developing their brains. there are more and more docs now who specialize in both concussion management and helping getting people back to normal activity. if your son is still symptomatic i would get him seen by a local sports medicine doc who is knowledgeable in concussion. my wife fell and hit her head she seems ok no disorientation knows the days of the week can count forward and backward do you think i should take her to emergency

well when you are pre-diabetic you are being introduced to diabetes. people think that diabetes is not so serious and is just a little sugar and that is not true. diabetes is really when the body can't process sugar. diabetes can sometimes lead to obesity. that is when the body builds up dangerous amounts of fat. when you have diabetes you are going to have pain in your knee. so you should check in with a doctor and tell him or her that you have diabetes. or you are pre-diabetic.

"atopic dermatitis is a very common often chronic (long-lasting) skin disease. it is also called eczema dermatitis or atopy. most commonly it may be thought of as a type of skin allergy or sensitivity. the atopic dermatitis triad includes asthma allergies (hay fever) and eczema. there is a known hereditary component of the disease and it is seen more in some families. the hallmarks of the disease include skin rashes and itching. the word ""dermatitis"" means inflammation of the skin. ""atopic"" refers to diseases that are hereditary tend to run in families and often occur together. in atopic dermatitis the skin becomes extremely itchy and inflamed causing redness swelling cracking weeping crusting and scaling. dry skin is a very common complaint and an underlying cause of some of the typical rash symptoms. although atopic dermatitis can occur in any age most often it affects infants and young children. in some instances it may persist into adulthood or actually first show up later in life. many patients tend to have a longterm course with various ups and downs. in most cases there are periods of time when the disease is worse called exacerbations or flares which are followed by periods when the skin improves or clears up entirely called remissions. many children with atopic dermatitis enter into a permanent remission of the disease when they get older although their skin may remain somewhat dry and easily irritated. multiple factors can trigger or worsen atopic dermatitis including dry skin seasonal allergies exposure to harsh soaps and detergents new skin products or creams and cold weather. environmental factors can activate symptoms of atopic dermatitis at any time in the lives of people who have inherited the atopic disease trait."

"tendonitis (also called ' tendinitis ') means ""tendon inflammation. "" with most medical terms the ""-itis"" suffix stands for inflammation. tendons are bands of strong fibrous tissue that connect muscles to bones. they can become inflamed for a variety of reasons from injury to over-use. my question regarding your question would be: have you actually been diagnosed with tendinitis in so many locations or are you self-diagnosing based on prior medical history? what i mean is if a person receives a diagnosis of tendinitis of the ankle and then has a similar pain in the shoulder area he or she might assume the pain is a result of tendinitis. that is not necessarily the case. if you have not obtained a medical diagnosis for your new shoulder pain please see a healthcare provider. many conditions can cause pain that feels like tendinitis. but if it's not tendinitis you want to get the appropriate treatment for the real problem. wishing you well! yes i have been diagnosed over the past 6 years or so. this latest one today."

mirena is birthcontrol. im pretty sure that the iud is a type of birthcontrol one of the most effective types. some people get it to help with heavy periods but usually just birthcontrol. so my answer would be most likely you are not pregnant i guess its possible but usually iuds are good for five years.
there is really little that i can do blindly over the internet since i have no way of examining your skin eruption. a visual exam is essential to make an accurate diagnosis. failure to improve on your current treatment may indicated that the diagnosis was incorrect or the treatment was not appropriate. your only course of action is to be examined again or see a dermatologist for a higher-level diagnostic opinion.
medication can stay in the body for about 24 hours before elimination. however the effects of the medication may be felt later on. by taking yaz you are putting an exogenous form of hormones into your body to help regulate your cycle. your natural hormones are thereby replaced. it takes a moment for your body to kick in with the natural hormones during regulation of menses. this is why it is individualized concerning how long it may take to become pregnant after stopping the pill. if you are switching to another pill you can start immediately.
this question was sparked no doubt by the much-talked-about individual mandate which is a central component of the health reform law. with some exceptions this provision would require all u. s. citizens to purchase health insurance or face a penalty beginning in 2014. at 53 with an annual income of $12 000 this reader would likely qualify for medicaid. starting in 2014 states will receive additional funding from the federal government to cover the cost of extending medicaid benefits. if you're an individual making $14 000 per year or a family of four earning $29 000 or less (133 percent of the federal poverty level) you would receive health benefits via medicaid and avoid paying a penalty. helping the middle class pay for insurance for the middle class tax credits will be made available to help pay for health plans purchased through health insurance exchanges that will be set up by 2014. if you're an individual making $43 000 or less or a family of four making less than $88 000 the government will subsidize your insurance premiums. you may also be eligible for reduced co-payments coinsurance and deductibles to assist with the cost of coverage. but if you fail to obtain insurance you will be penalized. here's how it breaks down: starting in 2014 the tax penalty will be $95 and that amount will gradually increase to the greater of $695 per year for individuals $2085 per family or 2. 5 percent of a household's income. there will be exemptions for financial hardship. the individual mandate  a little background the individual mandate was included in the new law as a way of paying for an additional 30 million uninsured americans to have insurance by requiring everyone to pay into the system. this is one the most hotly debated aspects of the new law. a number of lawsuits have been filed around the country questioning whether or not it is constitutional to require americans to purchase a product in this case health insurance. recent rulings in michigan and virginia upheld the new law. however earlier this week a federal judge in richmond va. ruled against it saying that the individual mandate to purchase health insurance violates the constitution. all this is to say that there will be many legal battles between now and 2014 when this mandate is scheduled to take effect. ultimately the decision as to whether it's legal for the government to require people to purchase health insurance will likely fall to the supreme court.
i recommend speaking with your health care provider as soon as possible because topamax is not recommended for use in pregnant women because it may cause harm to the fetus. your health care provider needs to re-evaluate your condition and truly talk with you about the risks versus the benefits.

the appendix is in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen; the right kidney is located just under the ribs on the right flank: different locations. kidney stones tend to cause blood in the urine (obvious blood or microscopic blood seen on a urinalysis); appendicitis does not. the answer is often solved by a careful medical history examination and a ct scan.
since the heart is the pump that supplies oxygen from your lungs and since you are getting out of breath with minor exertion seeing a cardiologist is a good next step. you may need an exercise treadmill test with attached to an electrocardiogram oxygen sensor and ultrasound. i don't think this important evaluation to rule out a heart-related cause would be a waste of money.
i think you should call your health care provider's office about this. your insurance company cannot change your prescription dosing. only a licensed medical professional can do that. please call your doctor or pharmacist right away to clarify the instructions for taking this medication. if the atenolol is provided as a tablet it's possible you may be able to split the tablet and continue to take one 50-mg dose twice a day. but i do not want you to do that without guidance from your pharmacist or health care provider. hope this helps!

"bipolar disorder is a mental illness that causes dramatic shifts in mood inciting episodes of both mania and depression. during the ""manic"" episodes patients swing into an unrealistically ""high"" state of mind and momentarily lose touch with some realities. on the extreme end they may believe they have super powers or to a lesser extent shop vicariously for expensive items them don't need and usually can't afford. these episodes alternate with a depressive state. during this period there is a lack of energy irritability sadness and a feeling of hopelessness. in between there are can be periods where the patient seems normal balanced and in control. a small percentage of bipolar patients do however experience chronic residual symptoms. the early designation for this condition was ""manic depression"". now it is called bipolar disorder to indicate polar opposites or again shifts in mood and perception."

i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. have any of your medical providers done an x-ray of your abdomen? if not i suggest you contact your primary health care provider and request one. tell him or her you just want to make sure you're not walking around with a retained instrument or sponge. an x-ray is a cheap fast way to make sure the surgeons left nothing behind by accident. if you've already had an x-ray to confirm there are no foreign bodies in your abdomen then i'd suggest you consult a different doctor for a second opinion on what could be causing this pain. it seems like pain this severe should be attributable to some cause. i'd suggest you press your health care providers to find a cause for this pain. wishing you all the best!
autism is a medical condition in which there are problems with communication and social interaction. this is a rather serious condition to be diagnosed without a complex and complete examination. the child might lack eye contact as you mentioned. the babbling in these children might be accompanied with unusual gestures repeating othersÃ¢ÂÂ words whereas the words are less frequently associated with appropriate gestures. repetitive behaviour might be one of the symptoms that are most easy to recognize. it might include: compulsive behaviour ritualistic behaviour stereotypy or even self-injury. as for the slow improvement of the speech please consider that many children just need more time to talk and to be understood. different conditions might be causing this situation. sometimes the child might need help from a specialist for speech and language therapy whom you are advised to visit. s/he might be able to detect if there are any physiological problems with the speech-related organs (the tongue the palate the throat) or the child simply needs more time to develop the speech. to exclude autism you might want to take your child to a neuropsychologist pediatrician. until than please keep in mind that there are many children at the age of 19 months whose speech is not fluent enough to be understood clearly.
"he needs to see a neurologist. they will not cure his stubborness however but they may be able to determine the cause of his symptoms and perhap find a solution. it is interesting that you used the term ""penalty of death"" since these symptoms could indeed be serious and his failure to take care of himself by seeing a specialist could have dire consequences."
i recommend you to be investigated by a neurologist do you have any impairment with sensation? especially in your extremities feeling hot or cold water?
in addition to exercise what you eat can help a great deal. the dash has been shown to help reduce blood pressure and it focuses on the following: a variety of fruits and vegetables a diet low in saturated fat and red meat protein sources such as fish lean poultry and nuts whole grains (whole wheat brown rice) over refined grains (white bread white rice) reduced sodium and less sweets in the diet for more recommendations on how to follow the dash diet see this post. good luck!
as a mother of 4 with my 5th on the way please know that you have to be patient. typical ob's will order an ultrasound at about 15-20 weeks. truly other than a heart beat and some newly formed limbs. an ultrasound at 6 weeks doesn't give you to much info other than if the baby is developing normally and accurately determining a due date.

hi you need urine test and culture until then your current medications are for symptoms management.
there may be some reason that the pediatrician would suggest this but in general we recommend breastmilk or formula exclusively at that age. my rationale is that there are only so many ounces in a day that a 2 month old will consume so you might as well offer some calories.
that temperature is just a variation of normal. less than a degree below the average. this is not medically-significant.
"if you've had shingles once, you probably wont get it again."
the response to treatment is very individualized. depending on the severity of the sinusitis the accuracy of the diagnosis the choice/dosage of antibiotic and thepatient's response to those antibiotics one could remain symptomatic for a week or more. since most sinus infections are viral the will (eventually) go away on their own. the one's that require antibiotics may last a week or more.
"not likely. a toe injury should not cause the systemic symptoms like you are describing. you most likely have something else going on; perhaps a viral infection in addition to your injured toe. there are no rules in medicine that states that a person can only have one issue at a time or that all symptoms must somehow be ""connected""."

urine can have an odor when it is very concentrated or from other foods. some foods (such as asparagus) vitamins and antibiotics (such as penicillin ) can cause urine to have a different odor. a sweet fruity odor may be caused by uncontrolled diabetes. a urinary tract infection (uti) can cause a bad odor. urine that smells like maple syrup can mean maple syrup urine disease when the body can't break down certain amino acids. a rotten smell should be medically-investigated at least by a urinalysis.
i wish there was an easy diet answer for ibs sufferers but you are going to have to do some investigative work to find what and how much of certain foods you have trouble tolerating. that being said most people with ibs have problems with greasy foods spicy foods caffeine-containing beverages (coffee and tea) and alcohol. certain foods can increase gastrointestinal discomfort when eaten in large amounts such as beans cabbage cauliflower peas and brussels sprouts. most ibs sufferers do better with smaller frequent meals (5-6 times daily) instead of big meals less frequently (2-3 big meals). i recommend you see registered dietitian (rd) that performs elimination diets such as fodmaps (fermentable oligo- di- and monosaccharides and polyols). he or she will help you identify if you are sensitive to certain carbohydrates in foods making your symtpoms worse. an rd can not only help you choose a diet that is tolerated but one that meets your nutritional needs. to find a dietitian new you go to eatright. org. this article provides more information on finding the right diet for ibs  good luck!
yes. besides the potential for west nile virus kids have less patience and are less likely to resist the urge to scratch the heck out of insect bites. its possible to open the skin by scratching leaving the area susceptible to bacterial infection. and again theres that nuisance thing â 20 bug bites can make it hard for a kid to comfortably fall asleep!

a uri is typically caused by a virus. and a virus lasts about 7 days and does not respond to any antibitoic so i don't know exactly why your medical provider felt you needed it. school attendance is more dependent on how you feel and the stage of your illness (colds are more contagious the first two days) so you won't know if you can go to school until you really wake up and see how you feel.

"fever and vomiting is not the ""flu"". influenza is a respiratory disesase not a gastrointestinal disease. her symptoms have nothing to do with the fact she had the flumist unless she was exposed to this different virus while in the waiting room. keep her well-hydrated and in most cases she will improve in a few days. call her medical provider if the vomiting does not stop since there are medications that can help."
yes. that would be a good idea. shingles will not jump off of you onto someone else so as long as your shingles is well covered (by clothing) you will pose little risk to most people. since babies have not been fully-immunized it would be wise not to put them at risk for a herpetic infection.
zika seems to only be transmitted through sexual contact to she should be safe. here's what the cdc has to say about the danger to non pregnant adults: zika virus disease (zika) is a disease caused by the zika virus which is spread to people primarily through the bite of an infected aedes species mosquito. the most common symptoms of zika are fever rash joint pain and conjunctivitis (red eyes). the illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting for several days to a week after being bitten by an infected mosquito. people usually dont get sick enough to go to the hospital and they very rarely die of zika. for this reason many people might not realize they have been infected. however zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause a serious birth defect called microcephaly as well as other severe fetal brain defects. once a person has been infected he or she is likely to be protected from future infections.

there could be a few different reasons why you bloat. here are some ideas: too much sodium can cause water retention that makes you feel bloated. check the sodium of the meals you are consuming. eating quickly (and too much) can also cause abdominal distention. fat or rich foods that take longer to digest can increase bloating. it could be due to a lack of healthy bacteria in your gastro-intestinal tracts. try adding fermented foods like yogurt and kefir or even a probiotic to see if it helps. there are certain foods that may be making you feel bloated. see this webmd article for more of the details. if the bloating causes you problems and isn't helped by any dietary changes you should see your healthcare provider to rule out any medical causes. best of luck to you!

you are smart to ask this question. grapefruit juice can cause drug concentration levels to rise in a person's system. and the list of drugs that interact with grapefruit is on the rise. the issue of grapefruit's impact on the body's uptake of levothyroxine honestly is a bit controversial. some studies have concluded the affect of grapefruit on thyroid medications is minimal but some thyroid experts maintain you should avoid grapefruit entirely if you take thyroid medication. your best bet is to check with your pharmacist or your health care provider for the latest research recommendations on this subject. they can guide you regarding the best strategy for enjoying your grapefruit without affecting your medication. wishing you well!

no that is not a sign of high blood pressure. one can certainly have high blood pressure and not know it but blue lips are not a sign. most people with high blood pressure do not have any symptoms or signs so get your blood pressure checked regularly anyway. hi found you this i think this matchs up with your symptoms. medical author: melissa conrad stoppler md related symptoms & signs skin discoloration depigmentation of skin shortness of breath cyanosis is the medical term for a bluish color of the skin and the mucous membranes due to an insufficient level of oxygen in the blood. for example the lips and fingernails may show cyanosis. cyanosis can be evident at birth due to the presence of a heart malformation that permits blood that is not fully oxygenated to enter the arterial circulation. cyanosis can also appear at any time later in life and often accompanies conditions in which lung function is compromised (resulting in an inability to fully oxygenate the blood) or conditions in which the heart's pumping function is compromised. the presence of abnormal forms of hemoglobin or other abnormalities of the blood cells can also sometimes cause cyanosis. the medical term for lowered oxygen levels is hypoxia; the term anoxia refers to the absence of oxygen. pseudocyanosis is the appearance of cyanosis that is not associated with reduced oxygen delivery to tissues. most causes are related to the ingestion of metals (such as silver or lead) or drugs/toxins. do hope this helps you. good luck
"well it could be. or it might not be. low testosterone (or ""low t"") is the flavor-of-the-month in men's health. it's blamed for everything from lack of energy to low libido. and while low testosterone certainly might contribute to those things it's probably not the sole underlying cause. many things can cause slow weight loss and erectile dysfunction (ed). your best bet is to see your primary care provider for a range of blood tests. these basic tests can help pinpoint the cause(s) of your current health conditions and get you on the path to wellness. by the way good job on the diet and exercise! even though things are slow going keep up the good work. wishing you well!"

if you're buying a new insurance policy it must include drug coverage. that's the law. the only possible reason for prescription drug coverage not being included in the policy you're considering is if you're talking about medicare rather than private health insurance. if that's the case and you're trying to buy a medicare advantage plan take a look at medicare plan finder at www. medicare. gov to search for policies in your area. you should be able to find another plan that includes all the services you need (outpatient and inpatient care as well as prescription drugs) or you can purchase a medicare part d policy which covers the cost of just prescription medications.
there are low risks of acquiring stds through oral sex yes. the main ones i worry about are hepatitis b and a. . herpes less likely. but it wouldn't be a bad idea to get partners tested if possible. the dental dam is like a big piece of thicker plastic wrap but regular plastic wrap is also a decent barrier in a pinch. i know it all sounds pretty odd but it is safer.
most helpful answer you will not likely have any long-term health effects from doing this once but don't make it a habit. all forms of smoking is bad for the lungs but our body does have a remarkable way of forgiving these isolated transgressions. take care of your lungs my friend.
a tiny amount of blood would not be a cause for alarm. the skin lining of the ear canal is rich in blood supply so you most likely irritated it when you used the q-tip. it is best to never use q-tips inside the ear canal. one of reasons water had a difficult time coming out of ears is because you do not have a adequate protective coating of (ear) wax. when water meets a waxy surface it will just bead up and fall out by gravity but if you do not have a waxy surface the water will remain.

good communication can prevent affairs by keeping relationships strong. it is especially important that couples share their thoughts and feelings about each other. when couples express their appreciation of each other they highlight all that feels good. by praising your partner for accomplishments or for particular characteristics (e. g. hard working benevolent) they will feel positively about themselves and you. by thanking your partner for doing something nice for you you let them know that you value them. another important part of good communication is talking about conflicts and painful feelings. people who are emotionally close are bound to step on each others toes sometimes. when this happens its important that they talk about it. this helps the offended party by giving them an opportunity to share their experience; and hopefully feel validated and cared about by their partners response. it also helps the offending party know the effect of their action; and provides an opportunity for them to offer a sincere apology sharing their deep feelings of caring. partners can also prevent affairs by proactively staying away from situations that threaten their fidelity. while conducting couple therapy over the years ive seen how both men and women have formed innocent friendships that eventually developed into affairs. so to prevent an affair from developing it is important that people are aware of this possibility and disconnect from (or put distance in) such relationships early on. they would also do well to think about whether there is something missing from their main relationship that leaves them vulnerable to looking elsewhere â and then to work on remedying that situation. unfortunately there is no absolutely sure way to prevent affairs or to ensure that someone you love wont hurt you. but maintaining good communication and proactively protecting your relationship are two very good ways to nurture a happy monogamous relationship.
it's odd that your doctor can't tell why you are bleeding. at this point you should probably get a colonoscopy - if you have insurance it might even be free. if they gave you a cream they probably thought it was a hemorrhoid. it could also be an anal fissure farther in. or it could be a polyp. it could also be diverticulosis or diverticulitis which is what happens when your large intestines develop little pouches in the side and sometimes they bleed. my dad nearly bled to death when one of those let go but luckily they are also very treatable. he's fine by the way. a colonoscopy is going to be able to tell you a lot more. they don't make you go through it while fully awake so it's not even all that uncomfortable.

this is a good question because there are a few probiotics on the market that are helpful with the symptoms of ibs. some patients may be treating their heartburn gas diarrhea or constipation with over the counter medications not realizing that it may be ibs. i would need to ask a few more questions in order to provide information. i need to know exactly what probiotic you are taking and what acid reflux medication. i also need to know what your symptoms are how long you have had them and what your diet looks like. there are many factors that can contribute to heartburn and there are some simple lifestyle modifications we can try first to see if that helps.
i had a shingle shot about a week ago. after that i have what the dr called tonsillitis. could it be possible i have shingles in my throat?
caution should be the watchword here. any med taken with alcohol can be a problem because almost all meds have to go through the liver to be broken down and that's exactly where the alcohol goes too. so there's a fight in the liver for passage and because of this the med builds up in your system since it can't be broken down. the result is something like a massive dose of the med and this has consequences. it's never a good idea to drink alcohol when you're taking any type of psychotropic med. some of them can have extremely bad effects but not everyone is aware enough of this. the best advice is to avoid alcohol.
in doing analytical dynamic or freudian therapy these terms are used. transference is how the patient unconsciously acts towards the therapist. i. e. if the patient is always feeling the therapist is harsh condescending vindictive (things we are trained not to be. ) and then the patient starts lashing out verbally skipping appointments then this may be a reflection about how the patient dealt with a harsh condescending vindictive mother or father. this helps the therapist understand the patient's behaviors which they can then work on. countertransference is how the therapist feels and thinks about the patient. we can get angry feel harsh vindictive etc. towards patients but in theory and depending on your training we are taught not to act on these thoughts/feelings but to recognize them and understand how the patient likely makes other people in their usual environment feel. for example if a patient makes me always feel angry and irritated they probably do this to their spouse boss family members etc. too. both are tools we use to help patients in this type of therapy
im a big advocate of weight loss surgery for people who qualify; they either have a bmi over 40 or a bmi over 35 with a related medical problem. it's a last resort but it's very effective. still i think most people would rather try a strategy focused on healthier eating and increased exercise first.
mcgoblin supposedly i also thought of that and i have looked up a lot of info through the internet and they said not to worry about it. also supposedly the urine should have killed or washed away the cum inside the urethra so most likely there's no sperm or less sperm count i supposed? mrknowles but do you have any websites or links for referencing stating that pre cum is actually more potent? because most of the links i have seen states that pre cum has lesser or no sperm counts at all. msnormal so whats your opinion? do you think that the sperms are able to survive in this whole process?

"examples of stimulants are dextroamphetamine (dexedrine, dextrostat, procentra), lisdexamfetamine (vyvanse), methylphenidate (concerta, daytrana, methylin, ritalin), and the combination of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine (adderall). stimulants were first used to treat asthma and obesity. today, they're also prescribed to treat problems such as adhd, add, depression, narcolepsy, and other problems."

hi i m not a cardiologist or anything but due to my experience with anxiety i can tell you that it had caused my heart to beat so fast that it made my chest hurt and i felt short of breath. to answer your question to the best of my knowledge arteries do not go from normal to clogged in 7 months unless you have risks such as family history of heart disease not being active and eating unhealthy foods (high in salt and fat). i would recommend however to call up your cardiologist and ask for yourself to get checked out again just to be sure.
hi well things are stacked against you even getting an erection but you say you get hbp statins antidepressants and antianxiety drugs are renowned sex killers. with this amount of shrinkage you could try jelqing and stretching but to regain its not going to be easy could well take a year to 18 months if your really up for it jelqing and stretching are pe exercises and your find them on www. pegym. com suggest you go and have a good look round the site just to see how others are doing and read around the forums and its not just for young guys i still do some and i'm 68. its gets blood going down your penis and this helps me with erections do love to get a good hard-on and keep it going. but with one testicle not working means you only getting half of any sperm your producing. do you gat any feel of ejaculations if so could be your getting retrograde ejaculations this is where your sperm goes backwards into your bladder if you see sperm in your urine that could be it and there is no answer for that. hope this helps you. good luck

colitis means inflammation of the colon. the colon also known as the large intestine or large bowel constitutes the last part of the digestive tract. the colon is a long muscular tube that receives undigested food from the small intestine. it removes water from the undigested food stores it and then eliminates it from the body through bowel movements. the rectum is the last part of the colon adjacent to the anus. the common symptoms of colitis include: abdominal pain. diarrhea. sometimes rectal bleeding. there are many different types of colitis with different causes. some examples of colitis include: infectious colitis caused by bacteria (such as shigella campylobacter e. coli and c. difficile ). infectious colitis caused by a virus (such as cytomegalovirus (cmv)). radiation colitis (such as following treatment with radiation for prostate cancer). ischemic colitis (such as a blockage of an artery in the colon by a blood clot. if the blood clot interrupts the flow of blood to a segment of the colon the result is inflammation of that segment and sometimes even death [gangrene] of the segment). crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (two related conditions that are caused by abnormalities of the body's immune system in which the body is inappropriately making antibodies and chemicals that attack the colon) infectious radiation ischemic ulcerative and crohn's colitis all have visible abnormalities in the inner lining of the colon. these abnormalities include edema (swelling of the lining) redness bleeding of the lining with gentle rubbing (friability) and ulcers. these abnormalities can be seen during either colonoscopy (examination of the entire colon using a long flexible viewing tube) or flexible sigmoidoscopy (examination of the rectum and the sigmoid colon; the segment of the colon closest to the rectum). edema and inflammation of the colon's lining interferes with the absorption of water from the undigested food and the unabsorbed water exits the rectum as diarrhea. pus and fluid also are secreted into the colon and add to the diarrhea. the redness bleeding of the lining with gentle rubbing (friability) and ulcerations in the lining of the colon contribute to rectal bleeding.
hi masturbating may lesion your chances as you say will expel his sperm form your vagina but in the heat of love making these things do happen. around day 143 should be ovulation day giver or take a day so you need to be having unprotected sex around day 9 this gives his sperm a chance to be in your womb waiting for the egg sperm can live for up to 10 days max in the womb and sperm takes 3 days to reach your womb. so day 1 first day of your period day 9 unprotected sex day not to much sex or masturbating him before that day and just lay on your back with your legs up after sex they say that last bit helps? but do relax its best that way give it a chance and it will happen. good luck

mymox (amoxicillin) is an antibiotic and has nothing to do with lactation or milk production. sudden weaning of baby may lead to both physical and emotional effects on both the mother and her baby. gradual weaning is good. medical suppression of lactation is not advised due to accompanying untoward effects. try doing the following. try using supportive padded bras. manual expression of the milk just enough to relieve pain or engorgement. do not empty the breasts at a time. frequency and time for emptying vary. for more information consult an internal medicine physician online  
in my opinion. it is most probably migraine headache and to a lesser extent sinusitis. a ct scan is a good diagnostic tool to rule out any other pathologies. try. triptan medications which include sumatriptan (imitrex) rizatriptan (maxalt) almotriptan (axert) naratriptan (amerge) zolmitriptan (zomig) frovatriptan (frova) and eletriptan (relpax). sleep well and drink plenty of water. if no progression then you will need to see a neurologist and ct brain is needed.
i have read and understood your problem. premature ejaculation is very common problem and is usually not associated with any disease. but may be due to anxiety and sometimes however may be problem with prostate gland and thyroid hormone. you can learn to control premature ejaculation by doing this exercise. pull your muscles that you pull at the end of urination for few seconds then release repeat this several times daily. another is stop-start technique: when you feel that you are going to ejaculate stop the sexual stimulation and divert your mind the penis will relax. after sometime start the stimulation again and repeat the procedure. over few months you will gradually increase your ejaculation time. most often it is a chronic problem; you have to take medicines in between and period off medicine. you can apply lignocaine gel to head of penis 10 minutes before sex and wipe it off before starting sex. usually medicines like dapoxetine 60 mg are given two to three hours before sex but you have to get a prescription from your doctor. best wishes. for further information consult a sexologist online

you are not likely to get pregnant if you take lybrel at the same time every day as directed by your health care provider. because regular monthly bleeding does not occur on lybrel it may be difficult to recognize if you get pregnant. if you suspect that you may be pregnant or if you have symptoms of pregnancy such as nausea/vomiting or unusual breast tenderness you should have a pregnancy test and you should contact your health care professional. stop taking lybrel if you are pregnant.

prostate cancer is a malignant (cancerous) tumor (growth) that consists of cells from the prostate gland. generally the tumor usually grows slowly and remains confined to the gland for many years. during this time the tumor produces little or no symptoms or outward signs (abnormalities on physical examination). however all prostate cancers do not behave similarly. some aggressive types of prostate cancer grow and spread more rapidly than others and can cause a significant shortening of life expectancy in men affected by them. a measure of prostate cancer aggressiveness is the gleason score which is calculated by a trained pathologist observing prostate biopsy specimens under the microscope. as the cancer advances however it can spread beyond the prostate into the surrounding tissues (local spread). moreover the cancer also can metastasize (spread even farther) throughout other areas of the body such as the bones lungs and liver. symptoms and signs therefore are more often associated with advanced prostate cancer.
your foreskin will not regrow no matter what your wife has told you. the only way to restore a lost foreskin from circumcision is with plastic surgery or using a scary-looking device designed to re-stretch any remaining foreskin residuals. i suspect both are expensive and probably not that comfortable. what is gone is gone. as long your penis still works just leave it alone and silently blame your parents for being misinformed about the advantages and disadvantages of circumcision.
since i have no way of seeing this red bump. or examining your mother first-hand it would not be wise for me or any medical provider to blindly guess. she needs to show this skin anomaly to her medical provider or a dermatologist so that she can be properly examined and diagnosed.

"cleaning inside your ear canal, especially with cotton swabs, can push wax deeper into the ear. that can cause a wax buildup (cerumen impaction) that can make it hard to hear with the affected ear. the shape of the canals can make it hard to clear the wax, and hearing aids or earplugs also can cause buildup."
i'm glad to hear you're following up on this and have had a nuclear stress test. it's great news that no heart trouble seems to have turned up on that. so why has your resting blood pressure gone up? well there are a number of possibilities. (note i'm not suggesting any of these may apply to you. i'm just talking about various reasons a person's blood pressure can rise in general. ) for one thing as we age our blood pressure generally starts creeping up. by the time a person reaches age 80 for example it's not uncommon for him or her to have a normal resting blood pressure of 140/90 or even higher. this usually is caused by a natural stiffening of the arteries as we age. that stiffness raises the pressure inside the arteries which results in an elevated blood pressure. another possible cause for elevated resting blood pressure is anxiety. panic attacks can make blood pressure go up and even a high level of general anxiety can increase the resting pulse rate and blood pressure. pain can cause an elevated pulse rate and increased blood pressure. people in chronic pain often exhibit this combination of symptoms. those are by no means the only things that could cause this particular combination of symptoms. i only wanted to highlight some of the obvious ones. i hope your healthcare provider is able to pinpoint the source of your elevated pressure and treat it. wishing you well!

generally if you have health insurance through your employer the marketplaces are not for you. if the insurance you're offered at work costs no more than 9. 5% of your annual income and covers on average 60% of medical costs you won't qualify for a subsidy when buying insurance on the marketplaces even if your income would otherwise qualify you. you should have received a letter from your employer explaining whether or not your plan meets the law's requirements. likely your best bet is to stick with your employer's plan.
it definitely sounds like it could be an abdominal hernia. this most commonly happens around the belly button or in a previous site of surgery. while most hernias are harmless some can be dangerous. it's best to get your doctor to check it out to make sure it's nothing that needs treatment right now.
sorry to hear this. sometimes our furry friends get a little too rambunctious! i'd suggest you have this checked out especially if you're running a fever. the main concern is infection. that swelling especially if it's angry and red is a potential indicator of infection. the other concern of course is whether or not the cat was properly vaccinated against rabies and the like. if you were bitten by a feral cat you definitely need to get this looked at. rabies is on the decline among domesticated animals but it could happen. or the cat could have been carrying another illness it has now passed along to you. either way it's not good to take chances with an animal bite. i wouldn't recommend you wait for an appointment. i'd suggest you head for an urgent care facility or even the emergency room. take care and heal quickly!
"well let's establish a few medical facts before we delve into the issue of whether or not valacyclovir caused the symptoms you described. first of all the fluor influenza can only be caused by coming in contact with the influenza virus. thus taking valacylovir and going for a run cannot ""cause"" you to get the flu. second 'nausea' is not a symptom of influenza. the flu is a respiratory virus. it affects your nasal passages and lungs. it's true if you swallow a lot of post-nasal drip caused by the influenza virus you might get nauseated. but generally speaking the flu is a respiratory virus. it's true that nausea and headache are potential side effects of valacyclovir. however i'm not aware of fever and chills being known side effects of this drug. to be fair the most common side effects of all medications are nausea and diarrhea so i tend to consider those as 'expected' side effects. if your flu-like symptoms persist you definitely should return to your healthcare provider for further evaluation. enlarged lymph nodes should not be taken lightly. if your fever exceeds 101. 3f seek emergency medical attention. meanwhile drink a lot of fluids. it's entirely possible you coincidentally picked up a virus just as you began your course of valacyclovir. the onset of your symptoms may have nothing to do with the medication but the symptoms are worthy of being evaluated further if they don't go away within a couple of days. wishing you well!"

an ophthalmoplegic migraine is pain around the eye including paralysis in the muscles surrounding the eye. this is an emergency medical condition as the symptoms can be caused by pressure on the nerves behind the eye. other symptoms of ophthalmoplegic migraines include a droopy eyelid dilated pupil double vision or other vision changes.
cystic fibrosis (cf) is a chronic progressive condition that affects the body's respiratory and digestive systems. it is due to a gene defect. people who have cf produce abnormally thick sticky mucus which clogs the lungs and leads to repeated lung and sinus infections as well as difficulty breathing. the thick mucus also obstructs the ducts of the pancreas preventing digestive enzymes from reaching the intestines. because so little food is absorbed children with cf have difficulty gaining and maintaining weight. cf also affects the reproductive systems of both males and females. females with cf may have difficulty getting pregnant. males with cf are almost always sterile because they produce relatively few or no sperm.
the cause of gerd is complex. there probably are multiple causes and different causes may be operative in different individuals or even in the same individual at different times. a small number of patients with gerd produce abnormally large amounts of acid but this is uncommon and not a contributing factor in the vast majority of patients. the factors that contribute to gerd are the lower esophageal sphincter hiatal hernias esophageal contractions and emptying of the stomach. lower esophageal sphincter the action of the lower esophageal sphincter or les is perhaps the most important factor (mechanism) for preventing reflux. the esophagus is a muscular tube that extends from the lower throat to the stomach. the les is a specialized ring of muscle that surrounds the lower-most end of the esophagus where it joins the stomach. the muscle that makes up the les is active most of the time. this means that it is contracting and closing off the passage from the esophagus into the stomach. this closing of the passage prevents reflux. when food or saliva is swallowed the les relaxes for a few seconds to allow the food or saliva to pass from the esophagus into the stomach and then it closes again. several different abnormalities of the les have been found in patients with gerd. two of them involve the function of the les. the first is abnormally weak contraction of the les which reduces its ability to prevent reflux. the second is abnormal relaxations of the les called transient les relaxations. the most recently described abnormality in patients with gerd is laxity of the les. specifically similar distending pressures open the les more in patients with gerd than in individuals without gerd. hiatal hernia hiatal hernias contribute to reflux although the way in which they contribute is not clear. a majority of patients with gerd have hiatal hernias but many do not. therefore it is not necessary to have a hiatal hernia in order to have gerd. moreover many people have hiatal hernias but do not have gerd. it is not known for certain how or why hiatal hernias develop. esophageal contractions swallows are important in eliminating acid in the esophagus. swallowing causes a ring-like wave of contraction of the esophageal muscles which narrows the lumen (inner cavity) of the esophagus. the contraction referred to as peristalsis begins in the upper esophagus and travels to the lower esophagus. it pushes food saliva and whatever else is in the esophagus into the stomach. when the wave of contraction is defective refluxed acid is not pushed back into the stomach. in patients with gerd several abnormalities of contraction have been described. for example waves of contraction may not begin after each swallow or the waves of contraction may die out before they reach the stomach. also the pressure generated by the contractions may be too weak to push the acid back into the stomach. such abnormalities of contraction which reduce the clearance of acid from the esophagus are found frequently in patients with gerd. in fact they are found most frequently in those patients with the most severe gerd. the effects of abnormal esophageal contractions would be expected to be worse at night when gravity is not helping to return refluxed acid to the stomach. note that smoking also substantially reduces the clearance of acid from the esophagus. this effect continues for at least 6 hours after the last cigarette. emptying of the stomach most reflux during the day occurs after meals. this reflux probably is due to transient les relaxations that are caused by distention of the stomach with food. a minority of patients with gerd about 20% has been found to have stomachs that empty abnormally slowly after a meal. the slower emptying of the stomach prolongs the distention of the stomach with food after meals. therefore the slower emptying prolongs the period of time during which reflux is more likely to occur.
hi this seems to be an allergic rash for sure. any infective rash would have been associated with fever. if local creams are not helping the he should be given anti allergic/anti histaminic medicines orally with similar creams. try finding out in the nearby surroundings what may be causing the allergy. consult a dermatologist if symptoms do not inmprove. thanks

tell your doctor about all your medical conditions including if you: have liver problems. are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. it is not known if emend for injection can harm your unborn baby. women who use birth control medicines containing hormones to prevent pregnancy (these can include birth control pills skin patches implants and certain iuds) during treatment with emend for injection and for up to 1 month after using emend for injection should also use a back-up method of birth control to prevent pregnancy. are breast-feeding. it is not known if emend for injection passes into your milk and if it can harm your baby. tell your doctor about all the medicines you are taking or plan to take including prescription and nonprescription medicines vitamins and herbal supplements. emend for injection may cause serious life-threatening reactions if used with certain medicines. some medicines can affect emend for injection. emend for injection may also affect some medicines including chemotherapy causing them to work differently in your body. your doctor may check to make sure your other medicines are working correctly while you are taking emend for injection. people who take warfarin (coumadin jantoven) may need to have blood tests after each 3-day treatment to check their blood clotting.

"whereas there has been some controversy about whether ""sexsomnia"" is a separate disorder or a variation of a common sleep disorder known as an arousal parasomnia there is no doubt that it does happen. during this the patient is typically in deep sleep and will perform sexual acts on a bed partner or him/herself. of course these episodes are very distressing to both the patient and partner. . the episodes happen during periods of sleep disruption. this might be due to stress alcohol intake irregular sleep schedule a sleep disorder etc. in each patient such inciting factors should be sought and corrected where possible. a sleep physician should be consulted to determine if there might be an underlying sleep disorder such as sleep apnea that might be causing sleep disruption leading to these episodes."

you need to work with your healthcare provider preferably a diabetes educator on your goals for blood sugars and a1c. another thing you can do is look more closely at your diet by making sure the amount of carbohydrates you consume is consistent across your meals. eating regular meals at about the same time daily and keeping carbohydrate servings to 3-5 servings at meals and 1-2 snacks is beneficial. this article can get you started on carb counting but i highly recommend you see a dietitian who specializes in diabetes. to find one go to eatright. org.
heartburn (indigestion) is a burning feeling that starts in the stomach and seems to rise to the throat. it occurs during pregnancy because your digestive system works more slowly due to changing hormone levels. also your enlarged uterus can crowd your stomach pushing stomach acids upward. recommendations: eat several small meals each day instead of three large meals. eat slowly. drink warm liquids such as herbal tea. avoid fried spicy or rich foods or any foods that seem to give you indigestion. don't lie down directly after eating. keep the head of your bed higher than the foot of your bed. or place pillows under your shoulders to prevent stomach acids from rising into your chest. don't mix fatty foods with sweets in one meal and try to separate liquids and solids at meals. try heartburn relievers such as tums maalox titralac mylanta riopan or gaviscon.
i usually only drink around two cups of coffee throughout my school day so about 10am to 6:30pm. weekends i might have a cup. i currently am on no medications. stress is a likely factior? is this something that is going to go away soon or will this constantly be something that i have to deal with.
in my opinion having hives in those areas are less likely relevant to your salivathis could be contact. allergic dermatitis to something related to the place you were at may be the bed or blanket.
these could be pilonidal sinus tracts (or openings) based on your description. these areas are capable of forming cysts or infections (abscesses) but as long as you are not having any problems just leave them alone. if you are a male make sure to keep hair from these areas.
im a radiologist. may be an mri misread. when performing an mri the constant motion of the heart creates challenges in obtaining clear images. best to try synchronizing the imaging with ecg tracing synchronizing the imaging with breathing or having patient perform repeated short breath holds during imaging.
you can try it but there are so many underlying factors that cause snoring that it would be best to see your medical provider or an ent first to see if you have a correctable condition. there are chin straps. nose expanders. special pillows. dental appliances. t-shirts with tennis balls sewed in the back. vitamin/mineral/herbal concoctions. that all claim to cure snoring so don't get caught up with false promises. as long as you can have a money-back guarantee (and they actually refund you money) you can try the chin straps. personally. knowing the anatomy quite well. i don't think a strap will be your answer.
your symptoms are appearing due to anxiety purely and not related to heart disease. it looks like as you get more anxious or have a panic attack you experience symptoms like palpitations and increase heart beat. so the first thing that you should do is to start meditating and relaxing. you appear perfectly healthy. so taking beta blockers can be done only if strictly recommended by a cardiologist and not otherwise. hope this helps.
yes. ovulation isn't just one day that can be accurately predicted (unless you have an ultrasound at home! ) it is a window of several days. the ovary will release an egg it will be captured by the fallopian tubes and perhaps become fertilized by any sperm that may be viable along this route. the egg remains quite vulnerable to impregnation for several days. we also know that sperm can remain viable and alive for up to a week in cervical mucous. your body is uniquely designed to become pregnant so when all of the pieces are in place. pregnancy may result.
i really have no way of determining if you are still pregnant. you need an ultrasound today. the sense of fetal movement (usually not even felt early in a pregnancy at all) could be from another source or reason assuming you did indeed have a miscarriage. my heart goes out to you. on a weekend you are probably going to need to go to the er or perhaps you ob can meet you at his/her office or the hospital to properly examine you.
that's a great question for your primary care provider. obstructive sleep apnea (osa) is a common disorder in which a person stops breathing for brief periods of time during sleep. this can in turn lower a person's blood oxygen concentration levels. low oxygen levels in the blood can damage the heart muscle over time. so i'd suggest you make an appointment to discuss the situation with your primary health care provider. he or she can advise you as to whether you should have a cardiac workup done in light of your new diagnosis. take care! i was trying to find the best place that would have information on this subject. i did a sleep study for 7 hours and it showed that i stopped breathing 12 times during the study? so i am aware that if your blood co2 is too high and o2 is too low your brain could be affected. i was put on a cpap machine but was told by the medical supply team that the doctor wants me on a bpap? what is a bpap? how do i find out which one of my 12 doctors recommended the change and why?
yeh ive been noticing it during foreplay but i kept going and didnt mention it to him.

"they can happen randomly, and there can be a lot of things that affect whether you have a nightmare. some people have them after a late-night snack. some meds are known to make nightmares more likely. and withdrawal from medications and substances, including alcohol and tranquilizers, may trigger nightmares. sleep deprivation is another cause. there are also psychological triggers, and some sleep disorders are causes, too."
hi i found this for you its a lot better than i could write its from this site  very early miscarriage very early miscarriage which is common - guessed at as up to 50% of all miscarriages - is a pregnancy that ends soon after implantation sometimes only a few days later. you may not even have been aware that you were pregnant. this early loss is medically referred to as a chemical pregnancy and it would once have gone undetected with-out the ultra sensitive pregnancy tests now on the market making it easier to get a positive result 3 or 4 days before your period is due. if a home pregnancy kit showed faintly positive it was not a false pregnancy test it was evidence that conception had taken place. the medical term changes to clinical pregnancy when a baby continues to develop normally but miscarries before it would be visible on an ultrasound usually at around 5 or 6 weeks gestation or within about a week of a missed period. when your period does arrive it can be put down to a late one and is usually heavier than normal so i think you had what they call a chemical pregnancy may have even been before you tested thats why it was so faint from what was writen above. hope this helps you. good luck
i know this was too late for her as i stated but as someone who is anaphylaxis with a reaction time of ten minutes after taking the penicillin and on a ventilator for 4 days i think its important that people know it can be transmitted via sperm. i was not aware of this and no doctor ever warned me and even when i showed up at the emergency room knowing full well where the reaction began the doctor did not believe me. i just thought people should be aware.
com these symptoms does not relate to your heart issue. you should go for testing your thyroid function and fasting blood sugar.
who told you this? fluids help utis and beer is a fluid but you can get more help from drinking lots of water than you can from drinking lots of beer. if you want to have a beer go for it but it doesn't really cure a uti or make it go away sooner. assuming you are a woman (most people with utis are female) drinking too much beer may lead to inhibitions. the inhibitions may lead to sex and of course sex can lead to another uti. a vicious cycle. all because of beer.
"there are two types of tics  motor tics and vocal tics. these short-lasting sudden movements (motor tics) or uttered sounds (vocal tics) occur suddenly during otherwise normal behavior. people often repeat tics. for instance, someone with a tic might blink their eyes multiple times or twitch their nose repeatedly."
anemia is when you do not have enough red blood cells. red blood cells contain hemoglobin which is needed to carry oxygen to all parts of the body. there are several common blood tests that may be used to diagnose anemia. a red blood cell count can measure the number of red blood cells that you have. hemoglobin can also be measured. these two tests are included in a complete blood count or cbc. a cbc can also tell the size of the red blood cells. once anemia is suspected by either a low hemoglobin or red blood cell count other blood tests may be done to see what kind of anemia you have. by checking an iron level and ferritin your doctor will be able to tell how much iron you have in your body. vitamin b12 and folate levels may be checked. these are vitamins you need to make enough red blood cells. sometimes other blood test will be needed as well. rarely your doctor may have to do a test on a sample of bone marrow for more information check out our article on the diagnosis and treatment of anemia.
hi you just checked one part of the fertilisation. you should also ask your partner to get himself check for normalcy of the sperms. if the problem is in his sperm count/motility/morphology then you taking fertility medicines will not help at all. thanks

here are some basic guidelines for caring for metered dose inhalers and dry powder inhalers but be sure to follow any additional instructions your doctor gives you. use a dry cloth to wipe away powder or residue from your inhaler. only use water if your health care provider recommended it. clean a spacer every other day  or once a week if you use it rarely. remove the soft ring at the end of the spacer. soak the spacer and ring in warm water with mild detergent. rinse the ring and spacer in warm water. let the ring and spacer air dry. or dry them thoroughly with a paper towel before putting them back together. do not store your metered dose inhaler or dry powder inhaler near heat or an open flame.

no one really knows the cause of sids but statistically it has been linked to babies sleeping on their bellies and babies who co-sleep. if you and your baby are falling asleep with your baby on your chest then you are definitely in the high sids risk catagory. although some babies are more comfortable sleeping on their bellies you should be able to retrain him to sleep on his back in his own crib by utilizing a tight swaddle and being consistent. .
"obviously without the ability to examine your finger to determine the significance of this ""chunk"" that you have i can only offer you some general information. most of these avulsion injuries will heal over time. they will scab over and gradually. new skin will form over this area. larger ""chunks"" may require stitches to close. since i cannot see your injury you will need to make a judgment about seeking hands-on medical care. keep the wound clean to prevent infection. use a topical antibiotic ointment and keep in covered with a bandage until a scab forms."
what kind of inhaler? there are many different types; some are safe in pregnancy some are iffy. for the best answer call your ob office give them the name of your inhaler and the dosage and get a patient-specific answer. your pharmacist can also help.

it may not be the weight loss but rather any changes in eating habits that caused the weight loss. if someone is skipping meals drinking more alcohol exercising excessively and fasting this can increase the risk of hypoglycemia. see your doctor to be sure. for more on the various causes of hypoglycemia see this article.
all mammals. humans and dogs. can have food intolerances. seaweed is really not a part of a dog's diet so i don't feel that it will hurt her but perhaps you should stick with more traditional foods from now on. maybe some dogs can eat seaweed (like those in japan) but your dog's gastrointestinal tract seemed to react poorly. dogs will eat just about anything (one of ours ate a whole pumpkin pie that was left in her reach) but that does not they should. clearly something did not agree with your little dog. i assume she is fine today.

recently i have been reviewing the subject of medical spas and in my files i found an interesting article published in plastic surgery practice several years ago. the story was an expose of medical spas with very thin physician coverage. the founder and executive director of the international medical spa association was quoted as saying there are many medical spas operating throughout the united states whose medical director is not necessarily an md.  i do think it is important that a physician and particularly one who is a skin specialist be on site and available at all times. after all the decision to initiate treatment is a medical decision. secondly what if there is a complication? who is more capable of recognizing and treating a complication? now medical spas certainly may have medically trained personnel including estheticians who are typically licensed by the state in which they practice. generally the state board of cosmetology oversees estheticians and the spa environment. however some medical spas take on procedures that are a bit more aggressive than an esthetician may be comfortable with performing. if you are considering having a skin-care treatment at a medical spa as opposed to a physicians office it would be prudent to ask the following questions: 1. is there a md on site or available for me to see? 2. what is the medical directors specialty? it is not unheard of for some spas to meet the licensure requirement to merely appoint a willing md who is not necessarily trained in skin management. the appropriate specialties are plastic surgery facial plastic surgery and dermatology. your skin deserves as much prudence in selecting professionals to care for it as any other part of your body.

psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disease that affects the joints. the presence of inflammatory arthritis with a history of psoriasis makes the psoriatic arthritis diagnosis more likely. because this form of arthritis can cause deformity and crippling just like rheumatoid arthritis it is important to have an accurate psoriatic arthritis diagnosis and treat the disease early and effectively. psoriatic arthritis usually strikes around age 30 to 50 equally affecting both men and women but it may also start in childhood. the skin disease precedes the arthritis in nearly 80% of patients. psoriatic arthritis may precede psoriasis in up to 15% of patients. some people may have both at the same time.
although flaxseed makes a great addition to a healthy diet i am not aware of a specific amount that has been found to decrease the symptoms you mention. it's best to see a dietitian who specializes in gastrointestinal (gi) issues or a doctor. for more on potential causes gi distress see this webmd article. that being said to get flaxseed into your breakfast you can add spoonfuls to cereal like oatmeal baked goods (like pancakes and muffins) and to smoothies. it really doesn't have a taste (a bit nutty) and it's a great way to get more omega-3 fatty acids and fiber.

sinusitis may be classified in several ways based on the time span of the problem (acute subacute or chronic) and the type of inflammation (either infectious or noninfectious). acute sinus infection (also termed acute sinusitis caused by infection) is usually defined as being of less than 30 days duration. subacute sinus infection as being over 1 month but less than 3 months. chronic sinus infection as being greater than 3 months duration. there is no medical consensus on the above time periods. infected sinusitis usually is caused by uncomplicated virus infection. less frequently bacterial growth causes sinus infection and fungal sinus infection is very infrequent. subacute and chronic forms of sinus infection usually are the result of incomplete treatment of an acute sinus infection. noninfectious sinusitis is caused by irritants and allergic conditions and follows the same general time line for acute subacute and chronic as infectious sinusitis.
"the spleen is on the same side as your left kidney so one possible explanation for hematuria (blood in the urine) would be a contusion of the kidney with bleeding. free blood in the abdominal cavity from a ruptured spleen would not anatomically be able to get into your ""closed"" urinary system so i suspect that your injury was not completely limited to your spleen."

the diarrhea cold chills and throwing up is more likely caused from the drinking for 2 days. with all the throwing up you likely became dehydrated and possibly a bit hypoglycemic. your body no longer had the nutrients it needed to function properly. drinking excessively and then the likely related side effects of diarrhea and throwing up could have thrown your all ready irregular period off. pregnancy only happens if you had unprotected sex with a man. if he had an std it could have been given to you depending on the std even if a condom was used. the only way to know for sure is to get check for both by your doctor. you can take a pregnancy test at home just pick one up at the pharmacy and follow the instructions in the box. good luck. in the future if you have diarrhea and your throwing up make sure your still drinking water to prevent dehydration. you will likely throw it up to but not before your body has absorbed some of it. also drinking for 2 days probably isn't a good idea any more.

when you're bitten by a malaria -infected mosquito the parasites that cause malaria are injected into your blood and invade your liver cells. the parasite reproduces in the liver cells which then burst open allowing thousands of new parasites to enter the bloodstream and infect red blood cells. the parasites reproduce again in the blood cells kill the blood cells and then move to other uninfected blood cells. the time from the initial malaria infection until symptoms appear (incubation period) generally ranges from: 1 9 to 14 days for plasmodium (p. ) falciparum. 12 to 18 days for p. vivax and p. ovale. 18 to 40 days for p. malariae. 11 to 12 days for p. knowlesi. symptoms can appear in 7 days. occasionally the time between exposure and signs of illness may be as long as 8 to 10 months with p. vivax and p. ovale because these parasites can survive in the human liver for a long time. the incubation period may be longer if you are taking medicine to prevent infection (chemoprophylaxis) or have developed partial immunity due to previous infections. malaria can begin with flu -like symptoms. in the early stages infection from p. falciparum is similar to infection from p. vivax p. malariae and p. ovale. you may have no symptoms or symptoms that are less severe if you are immune or partially immune to malaria. common malaria symptoms include: fever. chills and a rapidly rising temperature. headaches nausea and extreme sweating. symptoms may appear in cycles. the time between episodes of fever and other symptoms varies with the specific parasite you are infected with. episodes of symptoms may occur: every 48 hours if you are infected with p. vivax or p. ovale. every 72 hours if you are infected with p. malariae. p. falciparum does not usually have a regular cyclic fever. after the early stages life-threatening complications develop rapidly with p. falciparum and p. knowlesi and if untreated may result in irreversible complications or death. 2 if untreated you may recover in a week to a month (or longer) after being infected with p. vivax p. malariae or p. ovale. malaria can be a very serious disease for a pregnant woman and her unborn baby ( fetus ) and for young children. medication choices are limited for a pregnant woman or a child. infection with p. falciparum can lead to death for a pregnant woman and her fetus. for these reasons a pregnant woman should not travel to an area where she could get p. falciparum malaria. visit the cdc web site (www. cdc. gov/malaria/travel/index. htm) to find out whether malaria is a problem in the country where you will be traveling. malaria recurrences malaria caused by p. falciparum may come back (recur) at irregular intervals for up to 2 years if treatment is not complete. malaria caused by p. vivax and p. ovale may recur at irregular intervals for up to 3 to 4 years but medication treatment can prevent relapses. p. malariae can remain in the blood of an infected person for more than 30 years usually without causing any symptoms. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

many people dont realize that winter itch is a form of eczema one that tends to run in families. if your parents have it chances are that you and your children will develop it too. even babies can suffer from winter itch. even if you are genetically prone to eczema you can still take steps to protect your skin which may prevent eczema or at least ensure only a mild case. first of all moisturize your skin. this is the crucial step because you want to keep the skin barrier intact. even if it has turned warm again outside now is the time to start using the most effective moisturizers you can find. drugstores sell inexpensive yet highly effective petrolatum-based ointments and creams that are heavy enough to protect the skin. it is a very good idea to use these or a moisturizing lotion right after your bath or shower when the skin is still damp. oils work well too. for daytime wear when you may want to use something a little lighter and less greasy look for creams and lotions that contain hyaluronic acid shea butter avocado oil or glycerin. dimethicone a silicone-based ingredient works for many but not for those whose skin is prone to acne since it can increase breakouts. hands contain comparatively few oil glands and tend to dry and crack easily. the use of those alcohol-based sanitizers doesnt help either. not only do they dry skin more than good old soap and water theyarent as effective at killing viruses and bacteria. actually you dont even have to use soap which is undeniably drying to wash your hands. products marketed as gentle cleansers for sensitive skins work beautifully; carry a small bottle in your bag and use it instead of those scented soaps in public restrooms. in fact stay away from scented soaps period since they tend to irritate the skin. as for deodorant soaps they are absolutely terrible for anybody prone to winter itch â ditch them immediately! take shorter showers and baths and try to use a moisturizing body wash or a super-fatted soap. ifyour skin is very sensitive you can use the same gentle facial cleanser i recommend for hands.
hi. yes due to reduced pumping there is reduced blood flow to brain and as during any exertion the cells needs more blood and in case of less blood flow there can be episodes of pre-syncope or syncope. so you need to take care of exerting less and keep regular follow up with your cardiologist. hope this helps.
yes. and they are fun to watch (or experience).
as a couple you both have a problem but it may take a few visits to a counselor to work it out if you can convince him to do it (may be difficult). if he is excessively masturbating and watching porn then he may have a warped view of sex that needs addressing. while there is nothing wrong with self-pleasure he seems to be preferring masturbation of intimacy with his wife. for women sex is the most intimate form of communication and you and your husband are not communicating very well. you may be having sex in ordered to be loved and touched and this is not happening. i don't think you are too emotional. you both can have a mutually-pleasurable sex life again but you will need to work out some barriers first. if he cares about you he will participate in some problem-solving.
head lice originates from other people who have head lice. you would have to be a forensic anthropologist to know when this began but i suspect even cavemen had head lice or perhaps even cain and abel (adam and eve's boys). head lice have been around for as long as there have been people.
"i am not sure exactly what ""fleshy area"" you are talking about so i would suggest that your bring this up during a gynecological exam so that your practitioner can address this concern. most normal female anatomy does not interfere with intercourse but if you have some sort of a unique anomaly then a medical provider will need to see it. the urethral area alone can be quite sensitive from intercourse. in the meantime please ask that your partner exercise a bit more caution during sex so that any sensitive area is not traumatized."
its hard to say. but many things can temporarily stain the tongue including pepto-bismol candy throat lozenges etc. it may be that one of the materials stained his tongue. i would not be too concerned.
testosterone is the major male hormone. there are three different types of blood tests that can be used to measure testosterone levels. so the first step in understanding your level is to find out which test was used and the normal range for men in your age group. total testosterone is the most common test used. it measures all the testosterone in your blood. a typical range for men over 19 is 240-950 ng/dl but the results vary depending on the lab used. you can also measure free testosterone. free testosterone is a measure of the testosterone that is not bound to proteins in the blood. a typical range for men is 9-30 ng/dl. obesity affects the level of sex hormone binding proteins so your doctor may order a free testosterone level if you are obese. historically it was thought that only free testosterone was able to exert hormonal effects. we now know that testosterone bound to the protein albumin can also exert effects. bioavailable testosterone measures this level. bioavailable testosterone varies depending on the age of the man. for a man in his 20s the normal range of bioavailable testosterone would be 83-257 ng/dl but for a man in his 60s it would be 40-168 ng/dl. normal ranges differ depending on the laboratory used so be sure to discuss with your doctor what is the appropriate normal range for the lab where the test was done. if your testosterone level is low it is important to re-test the level to determine if a lab error or just a daily variation has occurred. the amount of testosterone varies at different times of the day so this is a blood test that needs to be repeated before making medical decisions. it is always important to make sure lab tests correlates with your symptoms. low testosterone levels in men causes decreased sexual desire erectile dysfunction and infertility. however testosterone also has other important functions. it affects behavior muscle mass and bone density. therefore a man with low testosterone can develop osteoporosis. finally in understanding testosterone levels your doctor needs to determine whether the root of the problem is a result of a problem in the testicles where testosterone is produced or if there is a problem in the part of the brain that controls the production of testosterone. measuring lh and fsh hormones produced in the pituitary of the brain will help make that distinction. once this information is available your doctor can decide how you need to be treated. testosterone replacement in the form of a patch gel or injection is usually given. but as with all medications there are cautions. testosterone can increase the size of the prostate and may cause worsening symptoms in men with benign prostatic hypertrophy and aggravate prostate cancer. so talk with your doctor to understand your test and his concerns.
"when still working at the muhammad ali center about 10 years ago i asked one of my fellows dr. holly shill to look at our pd population change from diagnosis to 25 years. first thing i want you to notice is that 25-year range. she found after looking at the unified parkinson's disease rating scale in more than 600 patients and 3 000 office visits several important things. 1) diagnosis of pd usually occurred at a score of about 25. 2) levodopa produced about a 12-point benefit a dopamine agonist about an 8-point benefit 3) patients with prominent tremor did better than patients with no tremor. we did not look at gait specifically but we did look at ""disability "" which we defined as 12 hours of effort to get 8 hours of pay. this had nothing to do with a need for a walker or wheelchair. on average people reached this point or a score around 60 at an average of 12. 2 years after diagnosis. i am sorry i cannot give you an average duration to a need for assistance with walking but hope that 12 years to retirement is good news."

do not put anything inside the cast. this could irritate the skin with small micro-cuts which can lead to an infection. do not use talc or creams inside a plaster cast. these become gritty when mixed with sweat which could also irritate the skin and cause an allergy or infection. raise your arm or leg up above chest level for about 1 hour. this can help reduce the swelling and cool the area which would decrease the itch. if it is too intense talk with your pharmacist about using an oral antihistamine for the itching. be cautious about drug-drug interactions or drowsiness. if the itching is still too intense check with you doctor about recasting the area.

if the bumps are stable and have not changed or improved with treatment the next thing the dermatologist might consider (depending on where on the body the bumps are) is a skin biopsy to get a small sample of one of the bumps to send to the laboratory and have a deeper analysis of the skin to help determine the underlying cause.

"yeast is an ""opportunistic"" fungal infection. yeast loves warm dark moist areas typical of a two-year old's diaper. yeast is airborne can colonize in the colon and can just happen to anyone if the right conditions exist. especially children with weaker less-challenged immune systems. children who recently used antibiotics for any reason are more likely to get diaper-area yeast infections. a urinary tract infection is very common in little girls especially those that are diapered. utis can be misdiagnosed if the urine specimen is not taken by a catheter and properly cultured in the lab. the most common pathogen causing a uti would be the various germs (enteric bacteria) present in stool that conveniently migrates into their tiny urethra. a urinary tract infection in little boys is uncommon and needs a higher level of diagnostic investigation."
your moms lab results seems fine and in normal range for liver enzymes. although she is experiencing serious symptoms that needs urgent evaluation and diagnosis. anyway these lab results are either untrue or not related to her pathology so i recommend doing an abdominal usg and inr analysis. then will following up with further investigations. those symptoms are typical liver dysfunction symptoms and a you need to see a hepatology and endoscopy specialist. i wish one of our doctors may be having his /her clinic in your area so they can help you.

arthritis affects approximately one child in every 1 000 in a given year. fortunately most of these cases are mild. however approximately one child in every 10 000 will have more severe arthritis that doesn't just go away. many children have what is called an acute inflammatory arthritis following a viral or bacterial infection. this arthritis is often quite severe for a brief period but usually disappears within a few weeks or months. juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (jra) is the most common type of arthritis that persists for months or years at a time. juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is also now called juvenile arthritis or juvenile arthritis of unknown cause (juvenile idiopathic arthritis).

few people with toxoplasmosis develop symptoms because the immune system usually keeps the parasite from causing illness. however anyone with a compromised immune system is at risk for serious problems from toxo. these individuals include those undergoing chemotherapy people with hiv/aids or other immune disorders and recent organ-transplant recipients. in these people an infection that occurred anytime during life can reactivate and cause the severe symptoms of toxoplasmosis such as damage to the eye brain or other organs. ocular toxoplasmosis which damages the eyes can lead to reduced vision blurred vision pain (often with bright light) redness of the eye and sometimes tearing according to the cdc.
"hello welcome to hcm. i have gone through your history. you have been adequately treated for your pneumonia and i suppose you don't have any symptoms of pneumonia like cough, fast breathing, fever, breathlessness. since you have received intravenous plus 5 days of oral antibiotics, now you can resume about your exercise regime. as you say you had a non damaging heart attack, means that your heart pumping function is well preserved. so you must not have any issues with exercise. with every lung infection the lung capacity decreases by some percentage proportional to he severity of the infection. hence along with your routine exercises you must also undergo breathing exercises with incentive spirometry, inhaling deeply through one nose holding your breath and exhaling fully from the other nose, meditation and yoga. this will help you to regain some of the lost lung capacity. you should also get vaccinated with influenza and pneumonia vaccines that include common strains which cause pneumonia remember they don't protect you against all pneumonias but offer protection against common pneumonias.regarding naproxen too much of it may cause damage to your kidneys so i advice you decrease its usage and use it only when required rather than a daily basis.wishing you good health. regards"

"the short answer is: no. but this deserves a bit more discussion. heartburn is a pain that you feel around mid-chest and is caused by acid moving back up into the esophagus from the stomach. this pain often will go away when you take an antacid product such as a chewable tablet like tums or rolaids or a liquid product like maalox. despite its name heartburn does not involve the heart. ischemia is a condition in which body tissue doesn't get enough oxygen usually due to decreased blood flow. the term ischemia is often applied to the heart muscle but ischemia can happen to any muscle or even the brain. when the heart suffers from ischemia it can trigger a pain response which is called ""angina. "" this pain also occurs mid-chest like heartburn so it can sometimes be tricky figuring out if chest pain is a result of stomach acid (heartburn) or ischemia. the two conditions (heartburn and ischemia) have different underlying sources and are not related except in terms of causing pain in the chest. i hope this helps!"

to my knowledge no one has invented an internal blood pressure monitor nor do i think there would be a use for something this invasive. do you want to invent one? there are plenty of telemetry devices that will take your blood pressure automatically at prescheduled times. this is commonly done in hospitals like intensive care units. to put an internal device inside you like a pacemaker or defibrillator would seem to be more risky than just taking the blood pressure when you need it.
it would be highly unlikely for any surgeon (or an insurance company that would pay for this elective procedure) to agree that a hysterectomy is the way to go at this point. it is not just your age that is a contributing factor but a hysterectomy is not medically-indicated in most cases just because you have two kids and your periods are heavy/painful. see your gynecologist and i am sure there are other solutions to answer your concerns that are considerably less riskier than removing your uterus. thank you for asking with the age of just 18 i am afraid going for hysterectomy is unwise although possible. procedures like hysterectomy are permanent and there is no coming back and depression and other psychological accidents are common in such women as well. also there is a long life ahead for you you may wanna change your mind to have another child due to any reason and then you will need a uterus to conceive. so my suggestion is don't opt for it unless you have some severe problem with uterus like heavy periods etc. hysterectomy can wait till 35 years or older age. i hope it helps. regards dr s khan ehealthdesk
viral infections that lead to sinusitis may be contagious; bacterial sinusitis is generally not. its important to remember that most viral upper respiratory infections (common colds) cause nasal congestion which may involve the sinuses. if the viral sinus infection lasts well past the normal duration of a cold viral sinusitis may be diagnosed. these viruses are highly contagious and likely to cause a cold in others who come in contact with them. bacterial sinusitis most often occurs as a complication of a viral common cold. bacteria that are normally present in the nose and throat take advantage of the viral infection to invade the inflamed sinus passages. these sinusitis-causing bacteria may be passed from person to person but wont cause an infection unless the right conditions are present. unlike with cold viruses most people will not develop sinusitis even if they are exposed to the bacteria. are sinus infections contagious/ i don't know.
crixivan is not a cure for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids). people taking crixivan may still develop infections or other conditions associated with hiv. because of this it is very important for you to remain under the care of a doctor. although crixivan is not a cure for hiv or aids crixivan can help reduce your chances of getting illnesses associated with hiv. crixivan may not have these effects in all patients.

you can cough up blood usually a blood/mucous mixture from the respiratory tract but this is not an embolism. embolisms are inside the blood vessels. if you are coughing up blood it would be wise to consult your medical provider for a proper examination to help determine the source or reason.
it depends on how long and how many packs a day you smoked. you can expect:
no. just forgive yourself for a bit of human weakness and keep up your non-smoking efforts. essentially its just the receptors got fed a little bit. it might prolong their death which takes 26 or 28 days. what i'd like to tell you though is that after two weeks the craving only hit you 2-4 times a day and are so short one cup of tea later and they've gone. the other thing is this. get yourself down to a health food shop. they have cigarettes and tobacco with no nicotine. taste like horse hair tbh but are so satisfying and not addictive just for emegencies you know not failure its precaution. you see i was a heavy smoker and my cravings were easily lasting 20 minutes not the 4 minutes promised to me by quit smoking websites! i knew full well i wan't getting a hit from them but they took the craving away. i wasn't crawling the walls at all. in fact the first few days i felt like i was waiting for a craving. lots of folks would say no dont smoke at all. but the fact is once the physical addiction has past (28 days) you don't feel like a herbal. i still take them with me to festivals or big gatherings where i know i'm gonna struggle. if i have one i have one its better than having a real one and thinking you can get away with it. i've quit 5 times in total
the chance of you getting a serious infection or parasite (trichinosis) from a few bites of undercooked pork or this incident harming your baby would be extremely small. assuming you are in the united states and are eating inspected meat from a reliable grocery store or butcher ultimately from a highly-inspected meat-packing facility these pork-related events are very very unusual. now if you ate undercooked pork from a wild boar someone shot or from a dubious supplier that is a different issue. call your ob or primary care medical provider with your story so you can have some patient-specific advice but in the meantime. relax. you and your baby are probably going to be perfectly fine and your mother is going to be over-cooking pork to the point of burning it from now on!

with age bones begin to lose calcium  the mineral that makes them hard  faster than they can replace it. less bone remodeling takes place and the bones begin to thin. for women the loss of bone density speeds up during the first five to seven years after menopause when there is a sharp decline in the body's production of estrogen which appears to help keep calcium in the bones. factors that increase a woman's risk of developing osteoporosis include: being thin or having a small frame. having a family history of osteoporosis. having the ovaries removed. smoking drinking more than moderately or living a sedentary lifestyle. white and asian women are more frequently affected than african-american and hispanic women. certain medical conditions such as kidney disease cushing's syndrome and an overactive thyroid or parathyroid gland increase bone breakdown. glucocorticoids (anti-inflammatory drugs) anti-seizure drugs and prolonged immobility due to paralysis or illness can also cause bone loss.
i'm not sure from your question if you've been diagnosed with gallbladder disease or if you're self-diagnosing. it's important to know. gallstones can be very painful. if stones accumulate or block the bile duct surgery must be performed to remove the gallbladder. it is possible to live a long happy life without your gallbladder. if you only suspect your pain is due to problems with your gallbladder you should get a physical examination to rule out other possible causes of the pain. many conditions can mimic the pain of gallstones so it's important to get an accurate diagnosis. if your skin begins to turn yellowish you should seek emergency medical treatment as this can be a sign of a bile duct blockage. i'm sorry you're experiencing pain in your abdomen. that's never fun. wishing you well!
unfortunately there is no way to specifically target fat around your abdomen. you may see products or equipment that advertise as being effective to lose belly fat but these are all exploiting a myth called spot reduction. just because you exercise your abdominal muscles doesnt necessarily mean that the surrounding fat from that specific area is being targeted for fat loss. abdominal exercises may help provide a more toned appearance through muscle growth but only if youre at a certain body fat percentage to begin with. doing abdominal exercises may help to strengthen or grow your abdominal muscles but they wont help you lose fat around that area. the only way to lose weight around your waist is proper diet and exercise in general. unfortunately some people have a specific body type where fat tends to be stored mostly around their waist. your body will ultimately determines where you weight loss comes from. if you would like to still do abdominal exercises check out the ace fitness exercise library for specific exercises located here: 
"chicken pox does not cause sterility even if you have chicken pox lesions on your scrotum. your ""boys"" are safe. i really have no way to determine why your testicles hurt but orchitis would not be a likely consequence of chicken pox. you would need to see your medical provider for an exam if these symptoms continue or worsen. mumps on the other hand can cause orchitis that could lead to sterility so it would be wise to check your immunization status."

hi there! the best support is that when you are sick with the norovirus you should never touch someone because norovirus is very contagious. or if you touch a surface and your husband touches that infected surface he will most likely get sick. norovirus can be caused by food poisoning and it can lead to nausea vomiting headaches and other cramps and discomforts. the best thing to do while being sick with the virus is to wear rubber gloves and don't hug or kiss if you are sick. just keep in mind that norovirus is more serious than regular stomach virus.
yes. flu like symptoms can lead to ear ache. cold and cough may lead to congestion causing ear problem.

viral pink eye usually runs its course in one to three weeks. because it is not caused by bacteria viral conjunctivitis does not respond to antibiotics and can be highly contagious. artificial tears will also help relieve symptoms of viral pink eye. pink eye caused by the herpes virus can be very serious and may be treated with prescription antiviral eye drops ointment and/or antiviral pills. for bacterial pink eye the treatment will be antibiotic eye drops or ointment. this generally clears the symptoms within a few days. be sure to complete the full course of antibiotic therapy. for more stubborn cases an oral antibiotic may be prescribed. oral antibiotics are routinely prescribed for pink eye caused by gonorrhea or chlamydia. sexual partners are also treated. allergic pink eye should respond to topic vasoconstrictors antihistamines or steroid eye drops. repeating an earlier warning you should never apply steroid drops for any eye symptoms without a doctor's prescription.
floaters! my dad used to experience these all the time especially when driving or looking at a bright backdrop. here is a page of information on them! hope this helps! 
if the test was not strep then it was most likely viral. one virus in particular tends to last longer than the typical week. that is the ebv virus; the virus that causes mononucleosis. as you know i have no way of examining your throat over the internet but i would strongly suggest that you have your medical provider order an ebv panel (a mono test). i have no idea how long your throat will be sore since healing and recovery is very individual. if you do have mono it could be weeks before you are feeling better.
"postnasal drip is a lay term that refers to the sensation of thick phlegm in the throat, which can become infected. your glands in the nose and throat produce mucus continuously (1 to 2 pints per day), that helps to cleanse the nasal membranes, helps warm the air you breathe, and traps inhaled foreign matter. mucus also helps to fight infection."
no there is no guarantee the pain will go away. most people that have undergone back surgery will continue to have pain all their life. it will help but the pain will probably continue. the degree of pain will depend on how invasive the surgery is and how much damage has been done prior to having surgery

"well there are a lot of things that could cause this to happen. in fact when people who are really out of shape exercise vigorously and get extremely winded they probably are experiencing exactly the symptoms you describe. it would not necessarily be abnormal. many heart conditions can cause the symptoms you describe. when i say ""heart conditions "" i'm including a broad range of diagnoses from heart failure to arteriosclerosis. related conditions such as morbid obesity probably could cause heart rate acceleration and oxygen desaturation on exertion too. if you're experiencing these symptoms on a regular basis you should check with a health care professional to get a work-up. it would be a good idea to make sure your ticker's in good shape. wishing you well!"
hi this is a drug allergy or acute hiv infection i recommend that you see a doctor immediately good luck
"""psych meds"" is a pretty broad category that's hard to generalize about. lithium is well-known to cause problems with short-term memory and associative fluency though stopping lithium (or sometimes lowering the dose) usually reverses this. nardil is not known to cause cognitive problems (and in fact antidepressants in general are not associated with cognitive problems other than the tricyclics which have anticholinergic effects)."

i'm sorry to hear you're going through this and i'm sorry to hear your physician doesn't have someone covering while he's on vacation. if your mother's blood pressure stays elevated at that level all day long she should get treatment. those numbers are too high and you're right she's at risk for stroke. i also want to say however that as long as your mother understands the risks involved with allowing her blood pressure to remain high and as long as she is not suffering from dementia or some sort of inability to make her own decisions she has the right to refuse treatment. have you discussed with her what her wishes are? does she understand she could suffer serious consequences including death if she doesn't get her blood pressure under control? if she does then you need to accept her wishes. have you discussed your mother's end-of-life wishes with her? it can be a difficult conversation to have but anyone who's 81 years old needs to discuss these things with his or her loved ones. perhaps your mother wants every effort made to preserve her life for as long as possible. or perhaps she wishes to let her life wind down and die as peacefully as possible. those choices are hers but they should be communicated to her family. if you aren't comfortable talking with your mom about this you might consider bringing in a minister nurse or social worker to help have this conversation. you're a wonderful daughter watching out for your mother's health. i wish you both all the best!
hi. this can happen if you were heading for periods in 2 days. it may also occur due to hormonal changes in your body causing the vaginal internal mucosal lining to be more fragile. sometimes rough sex can cause this. u should have more of foreplay before sex to assure good lubrication during sex. thanks

yes mental health and substance abuse treatment must be covered in all new plans. you can read more detail about that here at webmd's health reform 101 blog. in 2008 the mental health parity and addiction equity act (mhpaea) became effective followed by the affordable care act in 2010 which put in place healthcare allowances that included individuals struggling with substance use disorders according to the healthcare law substance use disorders is included in the ten elements of essential health benefits.  (whitehouse. gov) this means that assistance and services for mental health and substance abuse treatments are covered under the new insurance plans. furthermore the law states that insurance companies have to provide the same percentage of coverage for substance use disorders that they pay for other medical illnesses. this means that yes your insurance will pay for drug detox. gallus detox center is a private inpatient detox facility specializing in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929.

"your biology, social environment, and age or stage of growth seem to affect how likely you are to get addicted. the more risks you have, the greater the chance that taking drugs can lead to addiction. as an example, sometimes addictions run in families with a strong genetic link. your social environment, including friends or colleagues, may also influence addiction. equally important is your stage of growth. studies show the earlier someone begins to abuse drugs, the greater the chances are that the addiction may lead to more serious problems."
to prevent your heart failure from worsening: keep your blood pressure low. in heart failure the release of hormones causes the blood vessels to constrict or tighten. the heart must work hard to pump blood through the constricted vessels. it is important to keep your blood pressure as low as possible so that your heart can pump effectively without extra stress. monitor your own symptoms. check for changes in your fluid status by weighing yourself daily and checking for swelling. schedule regular doctor appointments. during follow-up visits your doctors will make sure you are staying healthy and that your heart failure is not getting worse. your doctor will ask to review your weight record and list of medications. if you have questions write them down and bring them to your appointment. call your doctor if you have urgent questions. notify all your doctors about your heart failure medications and any restrictions. also check with your heart doctor about any new drugs prescribed by another doctor. keep good records and bring them with you to each doctor visit.
no i cannot help you regain your sight but by seeing a ophthalmologist at a large university-based medical center you may be able to benefit from having a high-level evaluation. if there were any way to restore your sight based on this exam i am sure they would discuss it with you.
i have been seeing patients for four decades. and never once have i heard of this recommendation. unfortunately i have no way of knowing what this doctor was thinking but the only reason a male would need a bra would be if he had gynecomastia (enlarged breasts) but even then. a bra would not be helpful. another reason would be more complex and that would involve him being a cross-dresser. very strange.
"genital warts look like small flesh-colored, pink or red growths in or around the sex organs. the warts may look similar to the small parts of a cauliflower or they may be very tiny and hard to see. they often appear in clusters of three or four, and may grow and spread rapidly. they usually aren't painful, although they may cause mild pain, bleeding, and itching."

thank you doctors for your insight. they have done mris and eegs and i cant even name all the tests! there seems to be some indication of a genetic link and iron accumulation (also genetic if i understand it correctly). i just needed to know if there was a possible link to the animals too. i can now address that issue with the parents and help them get it under control but for more obvious and normal reasons. thank you for your time and expertise!
personally i found the answer to this above very misleading. although she mentioned the controversy but she did not tell you about the overwhelming evidence against the cdc's view point on chronic lyme disease. you are not alone your are not the only one receiving answers such as this one as to why you are still sick. you will see for yourself through the help of a lyme literate doctor that antibiotics can and will help improve your symptoms. you will also begin to find that no doctor with a closed mind will be able to help you through this. there is a group on facebook called lyme disease awareness go there and get the right information from 13k people just like yourself who have been denied long term treatment from doctors. i was one of those people. i had other doctors who said i was fine call these lyme literate doctors quacks. that quack gave me my life back! go to the columbia university tick borne diseases research center website at the top there is a second opinion option in one of the menus click it and go see doctor brian fallon and get your answers there or at lymedisease. org

i have never heard that allergy shots would have any adverse sexual side-effects. as a matter of fact i do not think it would be medically possible for this to ever happen. see your ob-gyn for a consultation. if there is a discoverable cause for your inorgasmia it will not be your allergy shots.

i feel sorry for your loss. your problems are stress unable to sleep at night and body pain. so basically it is your stress that is leading to other problems. stress can be managed both by medication as well as by lifestyle modifications (behavior therapy). first try lifestyle modifications which include: drink plenty of water. whenever you sit idle make it a practice to take deep breaths. include one tomato in your diet daily. add omega 3 fatty acid supplements. exercise outdoor regularly. exercise will help to release endorphins which will lift the mood and activity levels. breathing for relaxation - inhaling and exhaling exercise or yoga. take diets rich in protein carbohydrates and low in fats. increase the intake of walnuts hazelnut flax seeds in diet. these diets are known to be a rich source of omega fatty acids. also proper sleep hygiene needs to be practiced daily so as to help you to maintain good sleep in the long run. sleep hygiene entails following important points. adhering to a fixed sleep in and wake up time. wearing loose cotton clothes at night for sleeping. keeping the room dimly lit and well ventilated. changing room or bed temporarily. avoiding stimulant substances in the late evening or night such as coffee tea etc. and also avoid watching television or listening to music late at night. avoid eating heavy oil rich fried meals late in the evening and at night. take small frequent meals at regular intervals and dinner at 8 pm with good time interval between dinner and sleeping. a warm cup of hot milk15 minutes before going to bed can help in good sleep. these lifestyle modifications will help in improvement of symptoms and you will feel better. if symptoms persist even after lifestyle changes then visit a psychiatrist. drugs like modafinil or armodafinil will help to maintain daytime alertness and will reduce fatigue. visit a psychiatrist for proper prescription of this drug. for further information consult an internal medicine physician online  
you can go to www. healthcare. gov to see what plans are being offered in your state. you can also check out the webmd coverage adviser which is a model that lets you compare total costs (premiums and out-of-pocket expenses) based on where you live your family size and what conditions or prescription drugs you use. you may find that a plan with a higher premium but lower out-of-pocket costs is better for you based on your individual characteristics.
the right colorectal cancer treatment is based on the degree of spreading or stage: cancer that is self-contained inside a polyp can often be cured with a colonoscopy. a snare on the end of the colonoscope cuts the entire cancer out. if colorectal cancer has spread into the bowel wall surgery is needed. part or all of the colon is removed (hemicolectomy or colectomy). once the cancer has spread into the body treatment becomes more complex. it will usually involve chemotherapy or other targeted colorectal cancer treatments. as you can see the treatments get more aggressive and invasive as the cancer spreads. so colorectal cancer prevention is the name of the game.
if this is truly your blood pressure (this actual reading would be very unusual since the top number (systolic) and bottom number (diastolic) is quite close together) yes i would be concerned. many blood pressure recording devices can give inaccurate readings so please take your blood pressure more often or better yet see a medical provider so that you can be properly evaluated.
you cannot get hiv from kissing not even french kissing. the common explanation we give is that hiv has to be in large amounts to get into the bloodstream to cause infection. in saliva you would have to drink or come in contact with a bucket of saliva with hiv in order to get enough of the virus to get an infection. also the inside lining of the mouth is tough to deal with chewing so unless there is a bleeding gum or ulcer on the mouth and someone with hiv gets either a bucket of saliva in your mouth or bleeds in your mouth (which hopefully will not be happening) the risk is extremely low.

the main ways to remove unsightly scars are to have them surgically removed and hope the new scars look better or laser resurfacing to improve the texture or intense pulsed light or pulsed dye lasers to improve the pigmentation and redness. the newer fractional co2 lasers have been used with excellent success on many scars and are a great advance over previous laser treatments.
clomid is a fertility drug given to women to stimulate ovulation.
is is itchy or did you scratch it? is there a recent history of recent insect bite or contact?
stretch marks are almost impossible to make disappear. certain lasers such as fractionated technology may help even out some of the textural irregularity. applying topical retinoids may also help.
if tuberculosis have not done irreversible damage to the tube and endometrium (inner lining of the uterus) then pregnancy can happen either naturally or with treatment. a simplest way to check these two things is one mid-cycle ultrasound (around day 13 or 14 of menses) to see the uterine lining (anything more than 8 mm to 9 mm should be reassuring) and one tubal patency test like hsg (hysterosalpingogram). in case of damaged or blocked tubes ivf would be a better option (in vitro fertilization) as it will also reduce the chance of ectopic pregnancy. for further information consult an infertility specialist online

there are a lot of torture-like devices that claim that enlargement can occur but none have been medical proven to work so don't waste your money. there are no medical treatments that will increase your penis size. sadly no. lots of guys use pumps and other devices but they often cause skin issues down there. if you do decide to use one make sure you are applying a penis skin moisturizer once a day. trust me. this will spare you from some pain and anguish. man1 man oil is a solid creme. you can get it online. good luck.
unfortunately the payment issue with medicare dates back to the early nineties to a formula that congress put in place which is supposed to be updated on a yearly basis and congress has fallen far behind. so they fix it a little step at a time. the president has called on congress since he came into office to fix it permanently. lets make sure that medicare is a good payer for docs. lets make sure docs on into the future understand that their services are essential to make sure that medicare beneficiaries get access to great care. and we will continue to work on that. this isnt an impact of the affordable care act. this actually has been a decade that congress has really failed to look at the overall payments for doctors with medicare beneficiaries. but weve got 45 million people including my 89-year-old father who is a medicare beneficiary and really depends on those incredibly important services. and having physicians who provide that excellent care is a part of the partnership and were going to make sure that happens into the future.

tunnel vision is a medical condition that results in a loss of peripheral vision. as a result the patient can only see objects from within a circular field. this condition has many possible causes including problems in the brain some eye diseases hallucinogenic drugs and certain extreme activities. blood loss to parts of the brain can lead to tunnel vision as can a tumor pressing against the optic never fibers. a person who is exposed to air that has been contaminated by oils and hydraulic fluids such as may happen in an airplane and during hard exercise may also develop this condition. becoming ill while in an aircraft can cause temporary vision problems. the pressure placed on the optic nerve causes the eye to lose retinal ganglion cells which can eventually cause the patient to go blind. for some patients a loss of peripheral vision may be experienced prior to blindness.
seeing a doctor sounds like the best bet. they can perform a blood pregnancy test and any other tests to rule things out!

the more times you have pelvic inflammatory disease the more likely it is that you won't be able to get pregnant. when you have pelvic inflammatory disease bacteria infect the tubes or cause inflammation of the tubes. this turns normal tissue into scar tissue. scar tissue can block your tubes and make it harder to get pregnant. even having just a little scar tissue can keep you from getting pregnant without infertility treatment.
cancer-related fatigue is one of the most common side effects of cancer and its treatment. the exact reason for this fatigue is unknown but it may be related to the disease process or its treatments. to combat fatigue follow these suggestions: evaluate your energy level. keep a diary for one week to identify the time of day when you are either most fatigued or have the most energy. be alert to your personal warning signs of fatigue such as difficulty in concentrating body aches and pains and feelings of exhaustion. conserve energy by planning ahead and organizing your work scheduling rest and pacing yourself. maintain good nutrition. exercise. regular moderate exercise can decrease feelings of fatigue help you stay active and increase your energy. manage stress by adjusting your expectations practicing relaxation techniques and participating in activities that divert your attention away from fatigue. talk to your doctors. there are times when fatigue may be a clue to an underlying medical problem. other times there may be medical interventions to assist in controlling some of the causes of fatigue.
if your surgery was fusion of l4 l5 andl5 s1 as a whole then it should not be moving. anterior slippage of the vertebrae can have complications on your lower limbs and even the spinal cord. the degree of slippage differs in treatment. if it is 1st degree then physiotherapy is enough with behaviour modification. if it is 2nd or 3rd degree then another surgery may be needed.
weight bearing joints like knee and ankle are most likely affected by arthritis. being overweight is a known risk factor of arthritis and even putting on 10 pounds may worsen the arthritis. while treating arthritis in obese and overweight individuals weight loss is considered as an important strategy.
for starters you can understand that having genital herpes isn't all that unusual. if you were to leave your partner to find someone else you'd have nearly a one-in-five chance of meeting another man with genital herpes or about a one-in-four chance of meeting another woman who is infected. if your partner isn't coping well you may want to suggest joining a support group. if you think genital herpes is harming your relationship you could try couple's therapy.

i would suggest they shop all of the new insurance options before deeming they'll need to choose between their mortgage or insurance. while it's true some people will have to pay more for coverage many more who have received such notices don't realize they qualify for subsidies to lower the cost of thier coverage or that less expensive options are available to them.
hydroxyzine (atarax) is not a nacrotic.
sorry to hear you're going through this. despite the fact you're married if you ever had sex with anyone besides your current partner you could have contracted a sexually transmitted disease (std) and not have known it. for example human papillomavirus (hpv) which causes genital warts often produces no symptoms. keep in mind it's also possible your husband is infected with an std and doesn't know it. however we're not going to jump to the conclusion this is an std. to answer your question yes i would suggest you see a medical professional about this. you need to find out if it is in fact an std or if it's something else entirely. you also need to get treated for it and find out how if possible to prevent it from occurring in the future. i hope it turns out to be something very simple and easily treated. all the best to you!
eczema is a term for a group of medical conditions that cause the skin to become inflamed or irritated. the most common type of eczema is known as atopic dermatitis or atopic eczema. atopic refers to a group of diseases with an often inherited tendency to develop other allergic conditions such as asthma and hay fever. although there is no cure most people can effectively manage their disease with medical treatment and by avoiding irritants. the condition is not contagious and can't be spread from person to person.

a dermatologist would be a good choice. their specialty is skin and many of them will do office procedures assuming this growth needs to be removed. many primary care providers will do this too but you will need to talk to your own to see if this is something he or she will see. this can be many things including a retained foreign body (like a splinter).

"fatigue is a lingering tiredness that is constant and limiting. with fatigue, you have unexplained, persistent, and relapsing exhaustion. it's similar to how you feel when you have the flu or have missed a lot of sleep. if you have chronic fatigue, or systemic exertion intolerance disease, you may wake in the morning feeling as though you've not slept. or you may be unable to function at work or be productive at home. you may be too exhausted even to manage your daily affairs."

unfortunately exercising to improve a hernia is likely to aggravate the condition. the hernia exists because of a localized absence of muscle and supporting structure. exercise can strengthen the surrounding muscles thereby worsening the localized weakness and increasing the pressures inside the abdomen. the result is that more tissue can be forced through the defect and enlarge the hernia.
no i dont think it's wise to do this especially if you wash it with hot/warm water leaves the skin dry.
"it sounds to me like you need to visit a doctor. i'm sorry if that sounds flippant but it's the truth. ""critically low"" vitamin levels can cause serious physical problems. that said i question where you're getting your data. blood levels of vital nutrients hormones (like testosterone) and other substances can only be measured by a blood test. a blood test can only be ordered by a licensed health care practitioner such as a doctor nurse practitioner or physician assistant. if your health care provider ordered tests that returned a result of ""critically low"" levels then that individual should have followed up with you to instruct you how to proceed (such as taking vitamin supplements or whatever). if you believe you are experiencing symptoms related to a lack of specific vitamins or hormones you clearly should see a health care provider as soon as possible. wishing you well!"

your first step is to educate yourself. you should look for products that contain salicylic acid aha (alpha-hydroxy acid) or papaya-based enzymes to help exfoliate and remove unwanted cells. your next step is to focus on rebuilding and hydrating your skin. compounds containing tretinoin will work towards improving collagen synthesis. last and most importantly your daily skin care regimen needs to contain sunblock. sun damage and smoking are the primary causes of premature aging. yes you can use cocoa oil application on your skin butter also for the anti-aging skin. take juices practice yoga in the fresh air of early morning have some resveratrol which is actually a natural molecule holds the property of reversing the aging due to high anti-oxidant levels. have a look of resveratrol and benefits here.
"the answer is probably yes. usually individuals at risk for developing liver cancer are those with cirrhosis (advanced liver disease with permanent liver scarring). in other words cirrhosis is a precancerous condition. in fact patients with cirrhosis regardless of the underlying cause are at increased risk of developing liver cancer for example patients with cirrhosis from chronic hepatitis c chronic hepatitis b hemochromatosis alcohol and fatty liver. some of these groups of patients should have periodic ultrasound examinations of the liver as well as blood tests for alpha fetoprotein (a blood test that is produced by liver cancers) to detect the development of liver cancer early. there is one group of patients without cirrhosis that is at risk of developing liver cancer; that group of patients has chronic infection with the hepatitis b virus. a typical patient would be somebody born with hepatitis b infection contracted from his/her mother at birth (common in asia). the baby's immature immune system does not recognize the hepatitis b virus as ""foreign"" and thus tolerates the virus. (the body's immune system does not wage war against the virus. ) the hepatitis b virus is able to multiply and flourish in the body without causing the hepatitis (liver inflammation caused by the immune system) that leads to cirrhosis. however the virus can damage the dna in the liver cells and cause liver cancer. these patients typically have high levels of hepatitis b virus in their blood but normal liver enzymes and normal liver biopsies. such patients should have ultrasound examinations of the liver and alpha fetoprotein blood tests every six months to look for developing liver cancers."
a child of his age can get 6-9 viral infections per year on the average. if each one lasts a week or two it can seem that he is sick all of the time. the more exposure to other children the more likely he will share those easily transmitted germs. it is normal to be concerned about his immune system but as a child his immune system is inherently immature  children do get sick more than adults and older children. they tend to be better after age 6. as you know i have no way of specifically determining why he seems to get sick so many times so you will need to bring this up to his medical provider.
it may not be necessary for you to take a multivitamin provided your diet is well-rounded and you dont have any nutrient deficiencies. that said any multivitamin that provides 100% of the rda of all the essential vitamins and minerals is best. there is no specific formula necessary. it is generally preferable to avoid a multivitamin with iron unless you are anemic. talk to your health care provider or pharmacist to find the best multivitamin for you.

"hello and welcome to ask a doctor service. i have reviewed your query and here is my advice. in my opinion, you should definitely consult pulmonologist for this pain. you will need a chest x-ray and pft (pulmonary function test). a chest x-ray is needed to rule out recurrence of pneumonia because this can also cause similar kind of pain. pft is needed to know the severity of asthma. you may need inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroids (ics) (budesonide or fluticasone). don't worry, you will be alright with all these. hope i have solved your query. i will be happy to help you further. wish you good health. thanks."
hi if you have not already gone go now this can give lots of problems. good luck
it is true that the more severe the degree of obesity the greater the odds of type 2 diabetes. that's because the excess body fat fuels insulin resistance in the muscles and organs. there may be adverse hormonal effects on the beta cells as well. after years of insulin resistance the beta cells wear down to the point where prediabetes or full type 2 diabetes occurs but only in a certain fraction of indiviiduals with obesity. we don't fully understand why some people with obesity are at risk for diabetes while others can be obese their whole lives without getting it. the answer is likely in the genetics but we don't know which genes confer protection or susceptibility. similarly some thin people develop type 2 diabetes despite minimal insulin resistance. again the answer is in the genes but we don't know which genes.
"baby teeth are typically much whiter than the adult teeth. it is typically disheartening for parents when they see the adult teeth come out and they are more yellow. my own son is 7 years old and he is getting his front adult teeth. they are more yellow than the baby teeth. however they are perfectly fine and there is nothing wrong with them. the best thing to do is to go to the dentist and make sure that everything is developing properly. let all the adult teeth come out and only when your child reaches the age of maturity do we ""do"" anything about it. our society is preoccupied with ""toilet bowl"" white teeth. teeth are naturally ivory in color. ivory is not white! just make sure that your child is developing properly and don't worry about the color."
flexible spending accounts are a great option for many people including younger adults. they give people some additional money to use  on a pre-tax basis  for health services they need. and just like the name says they are indeed flexible. the best way to get word out is through forums like this and through employers. it's important to know that fsas are not a fix-it-all. they are limited to $2 500 annually in terms of what can be contributed. remember these are amounts that individuals have to contribute on a pre-tax basis. it is not just money given to them by employers.
while this may be frightening and unexpected a random nosebleed is really nothing to worry about. during sex the blood pressure tends to rise which can be a factor. low room humidity a cold or allergy taking a daily aspirin or minor nasal mucosa trauma can also be factors. if you are having an signs of bruising on your body for no particular reason one might consider a blood clotting issue that will require your doctor to examine you. if you nose is fine and you are not having any subsequent issues then i would not be too alarmed.
most helpful answer the flu (influenza) and the common cold are caused by different viruses. the flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses. the common cold is often caused by rhinovirus infection although a number of other viruses also can cause cold-like symptoms. influenza and the common cold have similar symptoms and it can be difficult to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone. in general the flu is worse than the common cold and symptoms of flu including fever cough sore throat muscle or body aches and extreme tiredness tend to come on suddenly. people with colds are more likely to have a runny or stuffy nose although the flu also can cause those symptoms. influenza infection can result in hospitalization and sometimes even death while colds are usually milder and generally do not result in serious health problems. the best way to prevent the flu is by getting a flu vaccine each year. also good health habits like covering your cough and washing your hands can help stop the spread of many germs that make us sick.
people who have had any of the following procedures may be at risk for developing lymphedema: simple mastectomy in combination with axillary (arm pit) lymph node removal. lumpectomy in combination with axillary lymph node removal. modified radical mastectomy in combination with axillary lymph node removal. combined cancer surgery and radiation therapy to a lymph node region (such as the neck armpit groin pelvis or abdomen). radiation therapy to a lymph node region. lymphedema can occur within a few days months or years after surgery. a small amount of swelling is normal for the first four to six weeks after surgery.

the most likely reason is that one of your previous sexual partners has not experienced the hpv infection (most women don't) and if you're not looking for them (regular physicals) there can be some that small that your doctor wouldn't see them with his/her eyes only. there is a tiny tiny chance that you had a wart on your hands or some other part of the body that you cut and then spread the virus to your genitals (the doc told me that he sees this pretty much only when women shave and spread the virus with the razor because both sites have miniscule nics). but this is so unlikely that i would say it has to be your partners.
most women want to look younger. at age 34 you are young and too young for wrinkles of the type you describe. the red shaggy description suggests there may be other skin concerns that you should consider. you owe yourself a trip to the dermatologist. let them evaluate you and make sure you have not developed an allergic reaction an infection atopic dermatitis or any other kind of skin condition. after you address any underlying skin issues you'll probably look healthier and younger. use sunscreen and a moisturizer that contains vitamins c e and a. also be sure to exfoliate in order to maintain a more youthful appearance.
your other testicle is likely fine so there is a very good chance that you are capable of fathering a child. the only way to prove fertility is to have a sperm count however. the undescended testicle really should be removed or relocated back in your scrotum where it belongs. see a urologist and get this fixed. this should have been done a long time ago.

"plantar means ""bottom of the foot"" and you do not have a bottom of a foot in your genital area. you can get warts but common warts and condylomata (hpv) in the genital area but not plantar warts. there are several concerns. first using chemical cauterization (this is an acid) can result in plantar scarring (if they were on the bottom of your foot). scars are not cosmetic but can make a person feel like they have ""something in their shoes"" when they walk. chemical cautery even done correctly can be ineffective since over-the-counter products are not very potent. i am not a fan of anyone using chemical wart treatments in the groin. since you may not be able to identify the type of wart you have in your genital area and since i don't know if you are a male or female i would strongly suggest that you see a medical professional to have them properly diagnosed and properly treated."

"what is considered normal on lab tests may not necessarily be normal for you. let me give you some background information. the test they usually perform to initially diagnose hypothyroidism is tsh or thyroid stimulating hormone. it has an inverse relationship with your actual thyroid hormone. think of it as a bill collector. if you don't respond when the bill collector knocks on your door they will start to knock on your door or call you with increasing frequency until you do respond. the tsh is the bill collector and if your thyroid ""isn't paying the bills"" aka isn't producing enough thyroid hormone (t4); tsh levels will continue to increase until the thyroid responds or your pituitary (master) gland decides its a hopeless cause and tsh production decreases or stops. the reason for this diatribe is because people get confused when they are told they have hypothyroidism and their tsh is too high. they don't realize the tsh is not actually the thyroid hormone (which is the hormone that will be low in this case). i just want to ensure there is no confusion when your provider gives you lab results. some providers don't realize that if your tsh is in the upper range of normal people and especially women may still have symptoms. thus you may want to work with your doctor on getting your tsh down to the lower ranges of normal (0. 7 -2 approximately). . the range used to be 0. 5 to 5 for tsh. the national board of endocrinology now suggests the normal range be changed to 0. 3 to 3 because people are still having symptoms despite being within ""normal range"". i prefer to keep my tsh around 1 because that's when i feel normal. "" everybody is different so that may not work for you. what it boils down to is you are a person not a lab result; if you have symptoms tell your primary care doctor. do some research write down questions/symptoms when you think of them and talk to your pcp about it. if you do not think he or she is taking you seriously get a second opinion."

you absolutely should not have sex until you have consulted your obgyn about this issue. you should not have sex even if your partner's infection clears up because he can transmit herpes to you even if he has no visible sores. genital herpes in an expectant mother can cause serious complications to the fetus including miscarriage and premature birth. your doctor will have more specific information for you regarding what types of sexual activities you can be involved in during pregnancy and how to protect your baby's health. wishing you well!
yes and it is also time not to go to jack in the box. i am not saying that the fast food at fast-food is diarrhea-provoking but it may be in your case. it could be the fat content of the food you are selecting or other factors. certain foods are known to trigger gastointestinal responses. most of the cases of diarrhea we see clinically are viral and they only last a week. diarrhea lasting three weeks certainly deserves some medical attention.

i have a great recipe that will fill the house with delicious smells can be made the night before and will give you sustained energy for the day (and will not have the kids sugar-crashing first thing in the morning). i highly recommend using sprouted whole grain bread like alvarado street or ezekiel brands. you will get protein fiber as well as other vital nutrients. the prep time on this is under 10 minutes and you dont have to think about it again until the next morning. you will need a large baking dish 1-3 slices of bread per person (one for the little ones and light eaters). use 6 egg whites Â¼ cup fresh orange juice 1 tablespoon of vanilla and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon for every 4 pieces of bread (so double this if you are using 8 slices). mix the eggs juice and spices together. spray your baking dish with olive oil cooking spray or rub lightly with butter. lay the first layer with bread and pour on the egg mixture to thoroughly coat the bread. add your next layer of bread and pour the rest of your batter over. let sit overnight or at least a few hours before cooking. bake at 400 degrees for 30-40 minutes depending on your oven (you want it to be moist in the center and brown on top). drizzle maple syrup over the top sprinkle with cinnamon and serve.
there are several topical solutions to help remove warts. many of these compounds contain salicylic acid which penetrates the warts and allows them to peel off. if salicylic acid doesn't help remove your wart your doctor may recommend treatment with cantharidin a prescription-strength topical medication. cantharidin causes the wart to blister within three or so hours after application. the blister lifts the wart off your skin allowing your doctor to remove the dead part of your wart.

some hair specialists use mesotherapy which is the injection of finasteride or minoxidil directly into the scalp to increase hair growth. however no studies have shown that this works any better than the traditional oral or topical use of finasteride or minoxidil.
most healthy adults may be able to infect others from 1 day before symptoms start to 5 to 7 days after becoming sick while children can spread virus for longer. antiviral drugs such as tamiflu can reduce the severity of illness and the length of time you are sick and can prevent serious flu-related complications from developing. while tamiflu can reduce virus shedding some people will continue to shed virus during treatment. therefore even while on tamiflu you can still be contagious. cdc recommends that people stay home during illness and for at least 24 hours after fever is gone unless medical care is needed. your fever should be gone without the use of a fever-reducing medicine.
high blood pressure (hypertension) causes heart disease which might explain your chest pains shortness of breath and fatigue. when the heart is unable to pump blood efficiently shortness of breath occurs as does fatigue. fatigue is also a very common side effect of many medications used to treat high blood pressure. nosebleeds can also be caused by hypertension. high blood pressure causes blood to leak out of the tiny blood vessels in the nose. unfortunately most people who have hypertension do not have symptoms. that is why hypertension is called the silent killer because the seriousness of this disease is not appreciated until hypertension has done damage to organs. your symptoms warrant immediate attention from a doctor. it is very important that your blood pressure be adequately controlled and that tests be done to evaluate your heart. for more and cure you can visit on www. globalbgcb. webs. com.
calamine lotion can be used to reduce the visibility of dark spots. you may apply it before you go to sleep let it dry completely and leave it overnight. 
yes you can. the depo will take about a month or two to take full effect. even then it is not 100% effective.
not as long as you are drinking plenty of water/fluids to go along with them.
that is really not a fever. temperatures can vary up to two degrees from morning (the lowest temperature) to evening (the highest temperature). i agree with your surgeon. it is nothing to worry about. and human body temperature is not affected by barometric pressure.
i am not sure i completely understand your question since the main reason women take birth control is so that can have sex at the same time. if you are talking about taking just one pill or your first pill on the same day you had sex this will not be an effective contraceptive. as you know sex causes pregnancy if you are ovulating at the time and your partner is capable of fathering a child. a woman on birth control pills really should complete a full cycle (one month of the pills plus a period) before using it as a contraceptive. using condoms for the first month would offer good insurance.
you can take 2 25mg antihistamine (benadryl) every 4-6hours. but don't take anymore than 6 in a 24 hr period.
neurocardiogenic syncope is the most common reason for fainting. neurocardiogenic syncope is also called vasovagal syncope. in neurocardiogenic syncope blood pressure rapidly falls and blood flow to the brain becomes very low. the person loses consciousness (passes out or faints) usually for only a few seconds. neurocardiogenic syncope can occur suddenly in response to a startling event or strain (a needle stick pain fear cough or defecation). it can also occur after prolonged standing heat exposure or exertion. some people experience a period of ill-feeling for a few minutes before actually passing out. neurocardiogenic syncope is common and usually does not signal any serious problem or increased health risk. however there can be many other reasons for fainting (syncope) some of which are serious. after a fainting episode further testing is often recommended to make sure a serious cause of syncope (such as an abnormal heart rhythm) isnt responsible.
hi yes you can fracture a rib during vomiting and coughing it also could be sever muscle sprain with costochondritis in the back do an x ray to be safe good luck
is it behaving like a normal period or just spotting? how long is it lasting for? i'm not sure why your back would hurt and am not trying to get your hopes up here but spotting happens around implantation too. your body can also do strange things around ovulation. if it turns out to actually be your period notice what you've been eating. significant changes in diet or weight can impact it. also significant increases in stress or change in exercise habits. if it lasts longer than your normal period or other strange symptoms arise i'd at least call the nurse practitioner at your gyno's office and ask. and in another 6 days take a pregnancy test just to know.
you need to confirm whether your husband's employer sponsored plan meets the law's affordability requirements. if the cost for just your husband's policy is less than 9. 5% of his income and the plan covers on average 60% of medical costs he won't be eligible for a subsidy even if your household income otherwise qualifies you. however if you're willing to pay the full cost of a health plan and wish to shop around for better coverage there's nothing stopping your husband from buying a plan on the marketplace.
hi you seem to have started to have bed sores because of being less mobile. use water bed. frequent change of position will help. proper nursing care and hygiene with daily dressing with mupirocin will be helpful. physiotherapy and symptomatic treatment are the only options for the other complaints. thanks
ask the gynecologist. but i suspect they are just doing a routine dipstick-type urine test for blood sugar infection etc. and they will have a urine specimen to check for pregnancy if necessary. it may be standing order. also it is good idea to have an empty bladder if you are going to have a good pelvic examination. you don't want someone pushing hard on your bladder area trying to fill your elusive ovaries when you have a full bladder.
of course but it is much less common. there are numerous theories as to why from the length/consistence of the hair to the use of various hair products but i don't believe those theories have been ever tested. the caucasian race seems to dominate the head lice proliferation at least in my experience.

i'm sorry to hear this. diarrhea is not only inconvenient it can be a true health hazard. you did the right thing by seeing a doctor and getting a colon test done. i'm wondering what the results were. i'm assuming you have not had a follow-up appointment. if you haven't scheduled one yet please do so. it's important you find you what's going on with your colon and discuss your treatment options with your doctor. in the meantime it's extremely important you drink plenty of water. diarrhea can be very dehydrating and it can throw your electrolytes out of balance. i'd suggest you alternate drinking plain water with drinking a glass of gatorade. this will help you maintain your hydration and electrolyte balance. i wish you all the best with this!
we do not recommend vicks for the babies in our clinic even though our parents used it on us and we survived. the ingredients in vicks has the potential of making a cough worse due to an allergic or irritant response so we don't endorse it. and i have to say that vicks on the feet will only make the feet a bit softer because of the petroleum jelly but it will not cure a cold or calm a cough. please don't tell your mother or grandmother that i told you this! a five month old is experiencing our germ-filled world for the first time on her own  your maternal immunity will completely wear out by six months even if you are breast-feeding. because they are so darn cute at this age people pick them up touch them and expose them so their cuteness is their own fault. she is also teething and drooling so this drainage is contributing to the cough when she is lying down. coughing helps clear her airway and helps prevent the fluid from going in her lungs. so it is really a good thing. use a cool mist humidifier suck out the nose (i know they hate it) and just hang in there. colds last a week or two but she will average 6-9 of these per year from now on. until she is about six. each cold makes her a bit stronger so think of these frequent viral episodes as free immunizations.
that's a really good question. basically it's a normally harmless virus that most people already have but immune suppressing drugs can cause it to reactivate and do damage. here's a link to a wiki article about it:  and a link to an article about the risks to ms patients: #3

you probably don't want to drop your employer's insurance. if your portion of the premium doesn't cost more than 9. 5% of your income you won't be eligible for a subsidy if you buy insurance on the marketplace. if you haven't already received a letter from your employer explaining that its health plan is considered affordable under the aca ask at work to make sure. you'll need to look for a plan for your parents separately on the marketplace. they may qualify for a subsidy. i would consult with one of the helpers available by phone at healthcare. gov.

your doctor will ask questions about your medical history do a physical exam and order medical tests to diagnose hyperthyroidism. if your doctor thinks you may have hyperthyroidism he or she may order: a thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) test which is a blood test that measures your levels of tsh. if your tsh level is low your doctor will want to do more tests. thyroid hormone tests which are blood tests to measure your levels of two types of thyroid hormones called t3 and t4. if your thyroid hormone levels are high you have hyperthyroidism. when you are being treated for hyperthyroidism your doctor will test your tsh and thyroid hormones several times a year to see how well your treatment is working. after you are diagnosed with hyperthyroidism your doctor may also want to do: an antithyroid antibody test to see if you have the kind of antibodies that attack thyroid tissue. this test can help diagnose graves' disease and autoimmune thyroiditis. a radioactive thyroid scan and radioactive iodine uptake tests which use radiation and a special camera to determine the cause of your hyperthyroidism. if you have graves' ophthalmopathy your doctor may also do an ultrasound mri or a ct scan to look more closely at your eyes. early detection it is not clear whether people who do not have any risk factors and who do not have any symptoms of hyperthyroidism need to be tested regularly for thyroid problems. the american thyroid association recommends that adults particularly women be screened for thyroid problems every 5 years beginning at age 35. but the u. s. preventive services task force does not think there is enough evidence to recommend either for or against regular thyroid testing. talk to your doctor about whether you need to be tested for thyroid problems. 1 2 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

congratulations on your new hair growth! your objective at this time is to maintain and nurture your current hair and scalp. just like our body requires nutrition so does your hair. essential nutrients such as biotin magnesium folate and zinc are required to maintain optimum follicle growth. it's important to maintain the natural oils in your scalp and avoid excessive drying of your scalp. do not wash your hair more than once or twice per week. when you wash your hair use a leave-in conditioner and apply vitamin e oil almond oil or avocado oil to the hair shaft. this will help keep the hair shaft soft smooth and lessen the amount of brittle dry ends on your hair. before you go to bed wrap your hair with a silk scarf. this will help hold in moisture. do not dye and perm your hair simultaneously. this combination can be very destructive to your hair shaft. if you follow these tips you will notice that there will be less split ends and breakage. therefore you will only need to trim your hair as needed. in general frequent trimming of your hair does not make your hair grow faster.
sadly yes. you can pass herpes type 1 or 2 to your children so it would be wise to hold off on kissing them when you have a lip lesion breakout. when you have genital lesions you should consider taking some suppression medicine (antiviral drugs) to limit your outbreaks and exercise some caution when touching these lesions or sharing towels. herpes can be spread even when you do not have active lesions but this is less common. there is a good chance that your children may get exposed to herpes simplex from one of their classmates at some time in their young lives so if they do get it it may not be from you exclusively.

i agree with you that the recent figures are something to worry about if you compare them with the previous ones. you need to do more of cardio exercises and build up on cardiac strength. if your exercise tolerance is good enough then you need not worry about these figures.
one of the primary risk factors for malnourishment with ulcerative colitis is a decreased intake of food. when uc flares there is inflammation of the large intestine or colon and small sores form on the lining of the intestine and rectum. this causes persistent cramping pain. it also causes severe diarrhea alternating with the formation of hard stool and prolonged constipation. diet doesn't cause ulcerative colitis. but certain foods may make symptoms worse. so in addition to the normal loss of appetite that accompanies a flare-up some people purposely reduce how much they eat in an attempt to ease the symptoms or out of fear of symptoms getting worse. at the same time the body has an increased need for additional calories protein vitamins and minerals to aid the healing process. also the inflammation and diarrhea interfere with the reabsorption of water and minerals that normally occurs in the large intestine and there is a danger of becoming dehydrated if the fluid is not replaced. finally some of the medications that are used to treat ulcerative colitis interfere with the body's ability to absorb and maintain the minerals it needs. for instance corticosteroids such as prednisone can deplete the body's calcium. medicines like sulfasalazine deplete the level of folate an important b vitamin.
as for word finding difficulties i look at pd as a condition that affects the ram on a computer. the basal ganglia initiate motor and thinking circuitry. your memory is fine but the circuit that gets the word to speech is a little slow. when you get in a hurry or you have a number of simultaneous tasks it gets worse. you may consider 2 approaches: slow down and concentrate on one thing at a time or perhaps discuss increasing your pd treatment with your doctor.
flexeril and robaxin are both muscle relaxants and will do very little for arthritis or herniated discs. flexeril in my clinical experience is usually better but the one you should use is the one that works best for you and the one that your medical provider has prescribed based on your response.
given the length of time you've been consistently taking birth control i'd say this is highly unlikely. it sounds like what you're experiencing is breakthrough bleeding and if you're having your pills changed (ie. seeing your doctor soon) it's probably a good thing to mention (as well as your fears re: pregnancy) to your health care provider.
floaters just happen whether you drink wine or not. i have never heard of direct medical association with floaters and wine.

it may be a pilonidal sinus tract but this is just a guess since i do not know anything about you your medical history etc.
it's probably not so much the shampoo as it is the water that's affecting your hair color. i have actually inquired from a lot of different companies and most of the shampoos; if you look at head & shoulders for example does not affect your hair color. so that's something that's very important to understand. but what happens is when you color your hair the hair can become more porous and that means that everything you do to your hair can affect it more. so sun exposure will make your hair more brassy and more dry. because the sun also dries out your skin and takes the water out of your skin and your hair as well as well as the ultraviolet rays changing the color. so that's something you want to be careful about. don't stay in the shower for too long and don't let the water just run over your hair for more than ten minutes at a time. use a conditioner and a shampoo that are specifically designed for color treated hair because they will coat the hair and give it some strength and volume and help protect that color from fading over time. but it's more the water than the shampoo that's the culprit.

before you choose a health care provider for pregnancy the first question to ask is whether your pregnancy is likely to be normal and uncomplicated or complicated and high-risk? if you have high blood pressure diabetes or a history of previous pregnancy complications are younger than 18 or 35 and older you should seek care from a health care provider experienced in treating women with your type of medical condition such as an ob/gyn or perinatologist. if you are at low risk for complications your family practitioner or a nurse midwife may be right for you. once you decide the type of provider that best suits your needs you will need to select one person in particular. you may want to schedule an introductory visit to meet with the health care provider you are considering and determine if you feel comfortable with him or her. here are some questions to ask during your meeting. how long have you been in practice? when and where did you receive training? are you board-certified? do you have professional or patient references? have you had any problems with your medical practice? to get this information contact your state medical licensing board. what are your general philosophies about pregnancy labor and delivery? think about how they fit in with your own beliefs. how many babies do you deliver per week? how many children do you have? are you in a group practice? if so will i see every provider with whom you rotate during my doctor visits? do i have a choice about whom i see and who delivers my baby? note: if you choose a health care provider who belongs to a group practice usually all the members of the group will see you during your pregnancy and one of them will be there for the delivery. who will i see at each appointment? will you be in town around my due date? note that there are no guarantees that a specific health care provider will deliver your baby since no provider is available 24 hours a day; make sure you know the other providers in the practice or with whom the doctor shares delivery responsibility. if i have a question who do i call? who responds to the calls? do you accept questions via e-mail? am i allowed to write a personal birth plan? will it be respected? a personal birth plan is a written agreement between you and your doctor as to how your baby will be delivered. it gives the parents more of a role in the decision making process; however the plan is no guarantee that your birthing process will go as planned since complications can arise. if complications arise your doctor will make decisions based on your and your baby's safety. what is your policy on inducing labor if i go beyond my due date? another important thing to consider when selecting a health care provider is where you want to deliver. if you have a certain place in mind you need to make sure that person can deliver your baby there.

hi if the cartilage was removed then this can be an onset of unilateral arthritis of the tm joint. loss of cartilage leads to reduction in synovial lubricant fluid between the two joint surfaces of the bones. this leads to friction between the opposing bones causing inflammation and pain. as there is a single bone (mandible) between both tm joints affection of one will have adverse effect on the other. get a ct scan done. thanks
hi this is from the uks nhs if you do get signs and symptoms these usually appear between one and three weeks after having unprotected sex with an infected person. for some people the symptoms occur many months later or not until the infection has spread. around half of all men with chlamydia don't notice any symptoms. if men do get symptoms the most common include: pain when urinating (peeing) discharge from the tip of the penis (this can be a white cloudy or watery discharge) pain in the testicles some men have mild symptoms that disappear after two or three days. even if the symptoms disappear you will still have the infection and be able to pass it on. if chlamydia is left untreated in men they are at risk of complications of chlamydeous such as orchitis (swollen testicles) reactive arthritis and infertility. do hope this helps you. good luck
most helpful answer great question! sorry to hear about your concussion though. i hope you've been taking things easy as your brain heals. tylenol (generic name: acetaminophen) with codeine is fine to take even if you have a concussion. in fact it's a better choice than something like ibuprofen because tylenol with codeine does not thin the blood. by the way your concussion symptoms should clear up by the three-week mark. if you're still experiencing any symptoms at that time it would be a good idea to get checked out by a health care provider to make sure you didn't hurt your head worse than you thought. also whenever you have a question about a medication's usage you can call and speak to a pharmacist. if he or she can't give you specific information (such as the safety of taking tylenol-iii when you have a concussion) feel free to call your primary care provider's office and ask to speak with a nurse there. they're always happy to help. best wishes to you!
liposuction is not a recommended treatment. this technique of extracting fat by vacuuming it from under the skin is not effective for cellulite. in fact liposuction may worsen the appearance of the skin by sucking out the cushion of fat that resides just under the skin. the result is additional dimpling of the skin.
"possible side effects of potassium and magnesium supplements include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort. if these side effects continue, call your doctor. if you take controlled-release tablets or capsules and have severe vomiting, vomit blood, or have abdominal pain or swelling, stop taking the medication and call your doctor right away."
red. orange. yellow. green. blue. purple. look around and pay attention to the color you see. is it bright and vivid? better or worse than yesterday? now think about how well you slept last night. or the night before. could it be that your ability to see colors depends on a good nights sleep? now this is fascinating stuff: research just emerging and presented at the 24th annual meeting of the associated professional sleep societies (apss) earlier this month suggests that sleep literally colors your view of the world. put simply sleep restores your ability to see and process colors correctly. the technicality of how this all works (and how the researchers went about figuring this out) is pretty complex but suffice it to say that color perception â whether or not you see gray or green for instance shifts while youre awake thus distorting what color youre really seeing. and overnight sleep brings your color recognition back in line with whats really there. so when you see gray you can be sure its in fact gray and not green. according to the authors scientists had not previously investigated how sleep might affect the way we see the world around us. but ill point out that other recent research has discovered that our ability to recognize and remember faces is indeed influenced by the amount of sleep we get. these two abilities (distinguishing color and faces) are not so different when you consider the science behind sleep and our memory banks. sleep has a profound effect on our memories. its well-documented for example that sleep plays a big role in helping us to:  remember things.  learn new information.  process data efficiently.  consolidate memories. (in fact its believed that dreams may play a special role in that consolidation though we dont know exactly how that all works yet. ) and of course we need to have sharp memories in order to recall colors and different faces â relationships that we learn. just as you learn to know that red is red and green is green you also learn which faces belong to your best friend first grade teacher and mother. what i love about this latest study is that it examines an aspect of life so prized by humans: being able to see a spectrum of color. this skill has enhanced human interactions for millennia helpful to not just social interactions but in some cases survival. granted some people who are truly color-blind dont have trouble getting through life. but if given the opportunity i think most people would prefer to see all the colors of the rainbow clearly. even if seeing color doesnt always equate with survival it sure makes life more exciting and in a word vivid. so the next time you cant distinguish blue from green so well (and youre bickering with a significant other over whether or not that tie is blue-gray or green-gray) ask yourself: did you get a good nights sleep? keep that memory sharp. enjoy the beauty of the world around you. keep up the good nights.
i have plenty of ideas. hundreds in fact but an idea is not a definitive diagnosis. you need to see a medical provider so you can be properly examined diagnosed and treated. you may need some diagnostic tests like a chest x-ray to rule out pneumonia or asthma. since i do not know anything about you your medical history or have any way of examining you my best advice is for you to be carefully examined.
hi. this fsh is elevated and it looks likely consistent with menopause or a lack of feedback to the pituitary gland from the production of estrogen for some time. estrogen is related to the monthly development of follicular cysts which produce the ovum each month. this high level of fsh would indicate that this has probably not occured in several months for some reason. this reason may be menopause but that is as specific as i can be based on this result alone.
some practitioners will administer a self-test of screening questions to individuals whom they suspect may be suffering from ocd. in addition to looking for symptoms of obsessions and compulsions by conducting a mental-status examination mental-health professionals will explore the possibility that the individual's symptoms are caused by another emotional illness instead of or in addition to ocd. for example people with an addiction often have obsessions or compulsions but those symptom characteristics generally only involve the object of the addiction. the practitioner will also likely ensure that a physical examination and any other appropriate tests have been done recently to explore whether there is any medical problem that could be contributing to the signs or symptoms of ocd.
yes in most cases but since i do not know your daughters complete medical history or her weight you should clear it with her medical provider first.

to use a condom correctly follow these main tips: a male should wear a condom throughout the entire time of sexual contact. a male should wear a condom each and every time there is sexual contact. the condom should not be removed before ejaculation and the condom should be held at the top of the penis closest to the body so it doesnt slip off before the penis is pulled away from the vagina. do not use petroleum jelly (vaseline) cold cream or baby oil with a latex condom because they break down the latex which may allow sperm and stds to get through. around 15% of unplanned pregnancies are a result of not using a condom correctly. condoms are sold in drug stores.

most helpful answer i would have waited till the morning that is why its a morning after pill. you should be fine with one pill i have used it a few times in my life and have never ended up pregnant after taking this pill. don't consume to much in a short period of time its not good for you. they are only meant to be used every now and then not every time after sex. bc or condom would be better. when you purchased the pill it should have came in a 2 pack you take one within 12 hours and the 2nd one 12 hours after the 1st one. good luck to you but you should be fine

about half of the women who have symptoms of the uti do not have at uti but rather urethritis (irritation of the urethral opening where you urinate). a menstrual cycle and the items use you for your period (tampon pads) can create some of this inflammation; even shower soap or bathing can cause irritation.

i need to know whether you mean blocked urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body) or blocked ureter (one of the two tubes that lead each from one of the kidneys to the urinary bladder). my late father once had a kidney stone that blocked one of his ureters causing hydronephrosis - his urine was backing up into the kidney. it was very dangerous and his urologist had to install a stent to keep the ureter open wider until he passed the kidney stone. during the time he had the stent he became temporarily incontinent and had to wear men's depends but after it was resolved that problem went away. [years later however both his kidneys failed completely. since he was dying of cancer at the time no one ever figured out why. ] if you have a blocked ureter the kidney to which it belongs will develop hydronephrosis unless it is treated; a urologist would need to tend to that and quickly. if on the other hand what is blocked is not one of the ureters but your urethra that would also be an emergency possibly a much more immediately urgent one. if the urethra is totally blocked the bladder cannot empty at all and will eventually burst upward through the dome. depending upon why the urethra is blocked treatment may involve passing a catheter into the bladder or even emergency surgery to remove the obstruction. if the urethra is partially blocked only a small amount of urine may emerge the bladder will become overdistended and a uti will be highly likely to develop; plus the condition will be extremely painful. in that case it becomes necessary to have a catheter passed into the bladder to empty it and then the condition that caused the blocked urethra treated. in men this is most likely to be caused by a swollen prostate gland. in women injury to the urethra and certain types of vaginal swelling are most likely though many other conditions are possible. in either case - whether it's your urethra or one of your ureters that is blocked - it needs medical attention. the sooner the better. as for the skin rash a doctor would have to look at that to see if it's connected but i do know that in actual kidney failure small crystals of uric acid or urea salts actually emerge through the pores of the skin but by the time this happens the person is near death and is not likely to be using a computer. the rash could still be connected in some way to the underlying condition though because it is true that either a blocked ureter or a blocked urethra result in toxins not being properly eliminated by the body. the most important thing is to get medical treatment for the blockage and then tend to the rest. good luck.

standard guidelines recommend a general approach of starting with lifestyle modification (eating and exercise) and then adding medications if blood sugar levels are not adequately controlled. if diabetes is newly diagnosed because a patient presents with symptoms of high blood sugar (such as excess thirst excess urination blurry vision etc. ) then we typically use medication immediately to bring the blood sugar closer to normal and alleviate the symptoms. furthermore metformin is approved to use in prediabetes to delay or prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes and one can justify using metformin in anyone with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes. the threshold for starting medication can therefore be any point between a1c of about 5. 9 to 7. 0. once the a1c is higher than 7. 0 it is harder to justify delaying medication. in any case doctors and patients need to have discussions about the benefits risks and drawbacks of using medications and these benefits risks and drawbacks change depending on the degree of glucose control and the type of drug(s) being considered. personally i start to think about starting metformin if a patient cant keep the a1c below 6. 5. if someone wants to use lifestyle change and weight loss to reduce medication i usually discontinue the sulfonylurea type drugs (glyburide glipizide) if the blood sugar levels start to dip below around 70-80 mg/dl or the a1c goes below 6. 5. i like to stop the metformin once the a1c stays below 6. 0 for about 3 months provided that the patient can maintain or extend the weight loss and lifestyle changes.

i don't believe that this over-the-counter product will have any adverse effecs on your oral contraceptives but there is a good chance that no studies were done to determine adverse effects (since this is not a drug). green tea or green coffee bean extract and caffeine are the main ingredients so it is up to you whether to add a secondary birth control method (condom) or not.
no the amount of the ejaculate is determined by the prostate gland.
"i am sorry to address this ""urgent"" concern so late but the answer is yes. this is why you should never use q-tips to clean the inside of your ears. ear wax is not dirt and it does not need to be removed. in most cases the damage was caused to your ear canal or you accidently ruptured your eardrum. most of these should heal without any permanent hearing loss but occasional a severe injury to the middle ear structures from a q-tip can cause some permanent damage. if you are complete well now. and have normal hearing. and no blood or drainage from the ears you are probably fine. the only way for you to be completely sure is to see a medical provider and have your ears properly examined. now. go throw away those q-tips!"
in many cases very warm to hot compresses over the eye will help this sty rupture and your body will heal it. if the sty (assuming it is a sty and not something else) does not resolve you will need to see an ophthalmologist for an examination. in some cases this lesion may need to be surgically opened or removed.
both pycnodysostosis and osteoporosis cause brittle bones. however pycnodysostosis is a disease with abnormally dense bones whereas osteoporosis is exactly the opposite a disease with washed-out porous bones. there would seem to be no conceivable connection between pycnodysostosis and osteoporosis. the new findings about cathepsin k and pycnodysostosis have made it clear that cathepsin k is a major protease in bone resorption. given this function it may well have a role in osteoporosis. cathepsin k may in fact provide a rational basis for a new approach to the treatment of osteoporosis. this is an excellent illustration of how research on a rare disease may bring benefits to those affected by a common disease.
if a beta-blocker is associated with ed i'd suggest switching to a different blood pressure medication rather than turning to a medication to treat the ed. fortunately there are lots of alternatives that are not generally associated with ed side effects like diuretics ace inhibitors and others. what beta blocker or b/p medicine will not cause ed abnormalities in blood pressure often relate to the diet and the body's ability (or inability) to absorb nutrients from food. to deal with that problem i suggest you read about the gaps diet and dr natasha mcbride. there's a powerful interview with dr mercola here:  as for your erectile dysfunction problem it is common to lose your erection at times - especially under stress. the fastest way to lose an erection is to start worrying about your penis and how long you are going to last. allow yourself to enjoy the feelings in your penis as you squeeze it at the base. this is the natural way to attain an erection. then focus on how arousing your woman is and how much she turns you on. if you are not attracted to your woman a different focusing strategy is required.

the vaccine has been approved for people 50 or older. the cdc recommends the people aged 60 or older consider getting the shingles vaccine. the vaccine helps reduce the risk of getting shingles by about half. in people who do get shingles it reduces the risk of having ongoing pain from a condition called post-herpetic neuralgia after the rash resolves. the most common vaccine reactions include redness pain or swelling of the area near the injection site. some people get a rash near the injection site. there is a certain group of people who should not get the vaccine. this link describes this group and provides lots of info about the vaccine.  take care
establishing a good relationship with your doctor is perhaps one of the best things you can do for your health. its important to routinely visit a doctor because some diseases and conditions wont present with outward warning signs or symptoms; so the only way to know your risk is to get checked out or tested. its essential that you find a doctor that you can trust and who embodies a similar philosophy regarding health as you. do proper research beforehand. ask friends or coworkers who they would recommend call your insurance company for their guidance or visit the webmd physician finder (found here:  ) that you can use to find doctors near you. the webmd site allow you to pull up a profile of each doctor where it displays information like their education and training to help you make a more informed decision. narrow your decision to a few potential candidates and then try doing internet searches for them to see if you can find reviews that people have written based on their experiences with that doctor. make sure theyre in your network if you have insurance as well. perhaps a good way to get over your distrust of doctors is to play a more active role in your health. ask questions so that youre well informed of what your doctor is doing or why your doctor recommends something. remember its your health and you always have the right to refuse anything if you dont feel comfortable or dont fully understand the reasoning behind it. ask your doctor to allow you time to do more research before making any big decisions as well. dont worry if youre still not happy after visiting your doctor or your experience didnt go well; you can always try to find another doctor that better meets your needs. i share y our concern! guidelines? try to find someone who will recommend one. older docs are best. pick a female next. doctors seem to be ignorant of the latest medical advances. when asked about a certain procedure that is less invasive they immediately want you to agree have the outdated procedure that they are familiar. they will not listen to your concerns. no answers to your question about the latest in office procedures that are equivalent. they have another patient waiting. one p. a twice suggested i medicate myself. re: a sore that would not heal. i used triple antibiotic with no results. he suggested that i should go home and try use bacitracin. . 3 days no improvement. finally i washed the area with dyna hex 4. sore healed and was gone in 2 days. at the followup i told him what i did to heal myself. his response was what ever works! another specialist wanted to remove my friends gall bladder even tho there were no stones seen only some shadows? gall bladder not needed. operation refused. do not expect much help at a walk in clinic. i went to one and waited 3 hours then i left an ent i went to for a sinus problem diagnosis sinus infection. after 3 days of dosing i had a reaction and went to the emergency room with chest pressure and low oxy levels. out in 2 days. medicare paid for everything! good luck p. s. even this site has no info on tmao testing or dmg use google them.
well that may be good for you but what about your partner's needs? sex isn't just about you. while the frequency of sexual activity is not as important as the quality of the intimacy. some people have sex in order to be loved/hugged and some people hug in order to have sex. sex is the intimate form of communication so if your sexual activity is not balanced with your partner you will need to talk about it.

"studies show that exercise helps restore the body's neurochemical balance and triggers a positive emotional state. not only does regular exercise slow down the heart-racing adrenaline associated with stress but it also boosts levels of natural endorphins  pain-fighting molecules that may be responsible for the well-known ""runner's high. "" endorphins help to reduce anxiety stress and depression."
"knowing which foods trigger food allergies and avoiding those foods is the best way to prevent allergic reactions. unfortunately food allergens are often ""hidden"" in sauces ice creams baked goods and other items. if you have food allergies read food labels carefully. be aware of other names for food allergens such as ""caseinate"" for milk or ""albumin"" for eggs. many people think that seeing ""nondairy"" on a label means there is no milk in the product. this is not necessarily true. sometimes products are recalled when food ingredients are missing from food labels. for a list of recalled products see the u. s. food and drug administration's recalls market withdrawals and safety alerts page at www. fda. gov/opacom/7alerts. html. eating out can be dangerous for people with severe food allergies. here are some tips: bring safe substitutes from home. for example bring soy milk to have with cereal. be aware of possible cross-contamination. for example an ice cream scoop may have been used for rocky road ice cream which contains peanuts and then used for your vanilla ice cream. alert the wait staff to the possibility of a severe food reaction. carefully question them about ingredients. if they are not sure ask to speak to kitchen staff. always wear medical alert jewelry that lists your food allergies. medical alert jewelry can be ordered through most pharmacies or on the internet. if you or your child has ever had a severe allergic reaction always carry an allergy kit that contains a syringe of epinephrine and antihistamine tablets. give the epinephrine shot as soon as you or your child feels a reaction starting. then take the antihistamine. for more information about the shot see: allergies: giving yourself an epinephrine shot. allergies in children: giving an epinephrine shot to a child. if you are traveling to another country learn the words for the foods that trigger your allergy so that you can ask in restaurants and read food labels. call airlines tour operators and restaurants ahead of time to explain your food allergy and request safe meals. prepare your own food when possible. discuss your travel plans with your doctor. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

there is a moderate interaction with one of the components found in janumet (metformin/sitagliptin) and zantac (ranitidine). ranitidine is a cationic drug and theoretically could decrease the excretion of metformin. this drug interaction has been observed when using another cationic medication cimetidine. because of this we use caution with similar medications. these interactions can increase the risk of lactic acidosis which included symptoms of malaise myalgia respiratory distress hyperventilation slow or irregular heartbeat somnolence abdominal upset or other unusual symptoms. lactic acidosis is a possible side effect from the metformin. consult your health-care professional if both of these medications are being prescribed together. monitor your reactions for side effects of lactic acidosis and stop medication right away if the symptoms occur.

anyone who has a family member suffering from dementia or alzheimers knows how difficult and heartbreaking these illnesses are. and its often anyones guess as to what ultimately causes dementia in a given person. what about sleep habits? well it turns out that we may have clues now to a link between the development of dementia and a sleep disorder known as rapid eye movement (rem) sleep behavior disorder (lets call it rbd for short). the facts:  with rbd the paralysis that normally occurs during rem sleep is incomplete or absent allowing you to act out your dreams. translation: youre not experiencing typical rem sleep that keeps you in a normal cycle of sleep.  these dreams are often vivid and violent compelling you to talk punch kick scream and even jump out of bed. translation: youre not getting the restful sleep you need.  rbd is usually seen in middle-aged to elderly people and more often in men. the researchers of this latest study found that 63 percent of people who experienced rbd developed dementia with lewy bodies or parkinsons disease in later life. in some cases the disorder was detected up to 50 years before the neurodegenerative condition developed. its not too surprising that rbd is also linked to parkinsons as 30 to 60 percent of people with parkinsons disease develop dementia. fyi: lewy body dementia is a rare form of dementia whereby small round clumps of normal proteins called lewy bodies (named after their discoverer) become abnormally clumped together inside brain cells. whether the lewy bodies directly cause gradual damage to the brain cells impairing their function and eventually killing them or are only a marker of some other destructive process is not known. scary? weve already seen that sleep loss causes brain loss. and when you look at the risk factors for dementia â eating a healthy diet engaging in regular exercise â both of which have been shown to reduce the risk of developing dementia by up to 60 percent is there any surprise that getting a good nights sleep is just as important? clearly we need more studies done to help us understand the associations between sleep habits and our risk for illness later in life. we also need more information on associations that go beyond just rare sleep disorders like rbd. the statistics are far too breathtaking:  one in three people over 65 will die with dementia.  twenty percent of us dont get enough sleep â banking less than 6 hours of sleep on average.  heart disease diabetes and obesity have all been linked with chronic sleep loss. so what can a lifelong battle with insomnia for example do to you in your golden years? insomnia by the way is the most common sleep disorder affecting approximately 64 million americans regularly each year. will a seemingly harmless struggle to get a good nights sleep in your prime position your body for ill health later on? unfortunately studies increasingly are pointing to yes. sleep matters. today. tomorrow. and long into our futures. the single most important thing you can do today to safeguard your health tomorrow might not be just what you eat and how you move. it must also include how well you sleep.

divorce isn't just the end of an official contract; it is a legal surgery that separates two people whose lives have been joined. particularly after long marriages it is painful and traumatic and people need time to heal afterward. moving on in a healthy way â healing from the pain of divorce â requires that you feel the pain. otherwise you are just covering a wound that is likely to fester under the surface demanding attention at some later time. so it is important to allow yourself to feel the hurt anger sadness or whatever other emotional distress that your divorce inflicts upon you. then you can actively take steps forward toward a happier future. at some point you will likely want to date again. hopefully at this point you will have a life filled with many things and people that you enjoy. also if you know what you are looking for in a person (i. e. respectful partner someone to go hiking with) and relationship (i. e. just fun long term commitment) then you are more likely to find it; and feel fulfilled by it. knowing what you want is also very important when you have children. consider your child's age and personality as you decide how to proceed. consider how much you want him or her exposed to your dating life. you will probably want to shelter them a bit from your exploration as each new date might unrealistically be seen as a possible threat (i. e. taking your attention dashing hopes of reconciliation with your ex-spouse) or savior (i. e. joining the family to once again make it complete). where can you meet people? how can you go about this? while it's not easy it's not impossible either. your attitude is critical. being happy hopeful and open to meeting someone can help you. because dating can be a bumpy road a positive attitude can also help you to bounce along without feeling too bruised. here are some concrete suggestions for finding a partner: 1) let people know that you are interested in dating; you might be surprised who can set you up with someone and who that someone might be (hopefully the partner of your dreams though you must also be prepared for the date of your nightmares). 2) join activities or clubs that interest you; then you will be happy with what you are doing whether or not you meet a special someone. 3) find out about singles activities and try some out. 4) try online dating services. there are many of them; just a few popular ones are as match. com eharmony. com perfectmatch. com and lavalife. com
if you stop taking crestor on your own the danger is that your cholesterol will rise. this puts you at increased risk for heart attacks and strokes. there is no immediate danger but it would not be in your best interest if you are at risk for heart attacks and strokes. you should talk to your health-care professional before stopping any prescription medication.
dehydration definitely causes a change in stool consistency but not usually color. water is actually stored in the colon (not the bladder) and can be used by the body when needed. during times of dehydration water is pulled from the colon and will result in dry hard stools (constipation). stool color changes can be due to many things. for instance if you took pepto bismol your stool would turn black from the bismuth. the types of foods that you may eat may also change stool color. knowing the color of the stool can give a clinician a clue as to the reason.
the clindamycin will help the bacterial vaginitis but it will not help yeast at all. as a matter of fact an antibiotic can worsen a yeast infection. i typically advise my patients not to drink alcohol while on antibiotics. while there is no specific contraindication to using alcohol with this particular drugh (assuming you drink in moderation) i still discourage it. you can always call the medical provider who is treating you for patient-specific advice.

"pcos is the most common hormonal problem in young women. it can cause infertility diabetes and an increased risk of some cancers. the signs of this condition often include irregular periods acne and increase or abnormal distribution of body hair. most women with pcos have problems with weight management. there are many treatments that target specific goals: oral contraception normalizes periods improves acne and can help reduce facial hair; diabetes medications help improve insulin sensitivity and reduces the risk of insulin resistant and type 2 diabetes; ovulation induction can help women achieve pregnancy; but dieting exercise and weight loss are the cornerstone of treatment and targets all of the above. pcos cannot be cured but it can be treated so its important to stick to your treatment. even more critical is that you know what your treatments targets. not all women with pcos have the same objectives when seeking medical care. it appears that your goal is successful weight loss and weight management. you need a health care team that knows how to handle weight issues more aggressively. set realistic goals: what are your pounds per week to loss? whats a reasonable calorie restriction for you? whats your exercise plan? and how will you monitor these intervention and stick with your plan? your plan will help you and your healthcare providers move you toward weight loss and better health. one of many suggestions that i give patients are apps for smart phones and a buddy systems for exercise. you'll be more accountable and likely to follow through. at the time of your follow up your doctor will then have information to push more aggressively through better nutritional consultation prescription medications or surgery. do not take this lightly! i went several years after being diagnosed with pcos and having mds tell me to exercise and diet even though i was. they looked at me like i was crazy and just flat out lieing to them. it took me many many years to find a doctor that actually did some tests which lead to a biopsy which was possitive for cancer. everyone else said i was too young in my early 30's to have any such problem. the biopsy results came in on a friday morning and i had a full hysterectomy and oopherectomy the following monday. after i healed from surgery i lost a 50 pounds without doing anything different at all. i still continue to loose weight without doing anything extreme. im about 35 pounds overweight my self 40 yr old male loved to eat and had a few problems with my health. so i turned evil and went on a 10 day lemonwater cleansing. lost 14 pounds and i feel better. my outlook on everything has changed in 10 painful and long days. so i say to you give it a try. you dont have to go 10 days just start out for 3 days and see how you feel! the more days you do it is the more toxins leaving your body. goodluck to ya! i have a friend who has pcos and successfully got many of the symptoms under control including the weight gain and had 2 children. the key though is finding the right doctor who will really partner with you on getting it under control. my message to you is that it's not hopeless but with all the ways it affects your hormones a doctor is really going to need to work with you. i found this article that had a bunch of info. you might already know all this stuff but if you don't i hope it helps.  i am not a doctor nor do i claim to be able to completely and utterly answer your question. but one thing that is (likely) happening is that your insulin level is increasing. this would be one cause of the lack of menstruation you're having. also though birth control makes you sick you may want to try a different type. with pcos there are a lot of hormones that are ""out of whack. "" birth control helped me in the past keeping control of my cycle (though not all of the time). i would speak with a gynecologist or an endocrinologist(sp? )."
people who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or some other lung conditions often take their medications using a device called a metered dose inhaler. an mdi is a handheld device that delivers a specific amount of medication in aerosol form rather than as a pill or capsule. the mdi consists of a pressurized canister inside a plastic case with a mouthpiece attached. with an mdi you press on the device while inhaling the copd medication directly into your lungs. its portability makes it easy to use anywhere anytime. mdis use a chemical propellant to push medication out of the inhaler. the two common chemical propellants are cfcs and hfcs. because cfcs cause damage to the ozone layer they are being being phased out and replaced by hfcs.

there are two ways atherosclerosis causes disease. 1) atherosclerosis can limit the ability of the narrowed arteries to increase delivery of blood and oxygen to tissues during periods of increased oxygen demand such as during exertion. 2) complete obstruction of an artery by a thrombus or embolus (thrombus and embolus are forms of blood clots) resulting in tissue necrosis (death of tissue). exertional angina and intermittent claudication are two examples of insufficient delivery of blood and oxygen to meet tissue demand. strokes and heart attacks are examples of death of tissue caused by complete artery obstruction by blood clots. there are many similarities between coronary artery diseases (atherosclerosis involving the arteries of the heart) and peripheral artery disease. for example patients with exertional angina typically have no symptoms at rest. but during exertion the critically narrowed coronary arteries are incapable of increasing blood and oxygen delivery to meet the increased oxygen needs of the heart muscles. lack of blood and oxygen causes chest pain (exertional angina). exertional angina typically subsides when the patient rests. in patients with intermittent claudication the narrowed arteries in the lower extremities (for example a narrowed artery at the groin) cannot increase blood and oxygen delivery to the calf muscles during walking. these patients experience pain in the calf muscles that will only subside after resting. patients with unstable angina have critically narrowed coronary arteries that cannot deliver enough blood and oxygen to the heart muscle even at rest. these patients have chest pain at rest and are at imminent risk of developing heart attacks. patients with severe artery occlusion in the legs can develop rest pain (usually in the feet). rest pain represents such severe occlusion that there is insufficient blood supply to the feet even at rest. they are at risk of developing foot ulcers and gangrene. when the arteries are narrowed as a result of atherosclerosis blood tends to clot in the narrowed areas forming a so-called thrombus (plural thrombi). sometimes pieces of the thrombi break off and travel in the bloodstream until they are trapped in a narrower point in the artery beyond which they cannot pass. a thrombus or piece of thrombus that travels to another point is called an embolus (pleural emboli). thrombi and emboli can cause sudden and complete artery blockage leading to tissue necrosis (death of tissue). for example complete blockage of a coronary artery by a thrombus causes heart attack while complete blockage of a carotid or cerebral artery causes ischemic stroke. emboli originating from atherosclerosis in the aorta (the main artery delivering blood to the body) can obstruct small arteries in the feet resulting in painful and blue (cyanotic) toes foot ulcers and even gangrene.
i have read your query and i understand your concern. acne has several grades depending on the type of lesions. in grade 1 i prefer to advise topical clindamycin in the morning and benzoyl peroxide alternatively with topical retinoids in the night-time. oral antibiotics are also given like doxycycline or minocycline or azithromycin in grade 2-4 acne. avoid hair oil application and oily food in the diet. in responding cases consideration is given to start oral retinoids. kindly upload the images so that i can actually visualize the lesions and advice you to my best. also mention the details of treatment you have already taken. revert back with the images to a dermatologist online  
"hi what your about to read did you do this? the effectiveness of most birth control pills is strongly affected by how consistently they are taken. the effectiveness or side effects of birth control pills can be altered by taking them late or by not taking them at the same time each day. therefore to get the highest effectiveness from birth control pills take them at the same time every day. if you miss one of more pills refer to the manufacturer package insert that came with your pills. in general for most pills the following should be followed: if you have a 28-day pack and you missed any of the last 7 pills in the pack - don't worry about it (except mircette where the last 7 pills do matter). in a 28-day pack the last 7 pills are placebo or ""sugar"" pills. these have no active ingredients; the pills are just there to help you know when to start your new pack. but make sure you start your new pack on time. if you miss taking one or more pills (except the last 7 pills in the 28-day pack) you may not be protected from pregnancy. - see more at: #sthash. ejo0b3gz. dpuf. yes as you can see it was a gathered piece of information i found this a piece of help. so at anytime did you miss a pill or two was your timing out are you now back taking your pills you missing your period could be from just the extra hormones in your body they can do things like missing a period but you should have just kept to the pattern of taken your bc pills. but as long as you used condoms for the first 7 days and with not getting your period in the placebo week you should have been using condoms with not having a period with luck you may not be pregnant. do hope this helps you. good luck ps if like most of us and you have a mobile phone set the alarm on it for the time you want to take you bc pill its a winner."

baby : your baby is still just a glimmer in your eye. although it's confusing to think about a pregnancy starting before your child is even conceived doctors calculate your due date from the beginning of your last cycle since it's hard to know exactly when conception occurred. mom-to-be : at the beginning of a cycle about 20 eggs called ova begin to ripen and occupy fluid-filled sacs called follicles. one of these follicles matures and ruptures releasing an egg that will travel down the fallopian tube where it awaits fertilization. this all takes place about 14 days before the end of your cycle. this is the time you're most fertile so light some candles take the phone off the hook and set aside some intimate time. an egg can be fertilized for only about 12 to 24 hours once the ovum is released. don't be disappointed if it doesn't work the first time. you have only about a 20% chance of getting pregnant each month. tip for the week : make sure you've scheduled a preconception visit with your ob-gyn to determine risks of genetic diseases environmental hazards and lifestyle changes necessary to ensure a healthy pregnancy and baby. most important make sure you've started taking 0. 4 milligrams or 400 micrograms of folic acid a day. folic acid taken a few months before conception has been shown to dramatically reduce the likelihood of neural tube defects such as spina bifida.

"p { margin-bottom: 0. 08in; }a:link { } p { margin-bottom: 0. 08in; }a:link { } semen is not be a problem if he is disease free. however that being said swallowing semen is probably not as widespread as some would like you to think. i know that my wife doesn't like it and i don't force her to do it - that's nothing for her to be ashamed of. during oral sex she swallows all the pre-ejaculate (clear fluid) with no problem. occasionally when i kegel a heavy burst of pre-ejaculate will flow out and sometimes she will have to back off a little to swallow it. but the few times she has attempted to swallow semen has resulted in gagging â there's just too much thick fluid being introduced into the back of the throat to handle at one time when the penis is inserted 2-3 inches or more - unless you're really prepared for it. i know when i'm about to come and - unless your husband has premature ejaculation issues he does too. in 40 years of receiving oral sex i have only slipped up and started to ejaculate in her mouth probably less than 5 times. i tell her when i'm ready to go she pulls off and finishes me up with her hand. practice makes perfect. if you have a problem with the pre-ejaculate simply use a snug-fitting steel cock ring at the base of the penis to block the flow until such time as you think you're ready for it. i start with a cock ring occasionally for the extra engorgement sensation but i don't use it for the entire process because i am rather slow to come (40+ minutes) and the lack of blood flow through the penis for that period of time would be an issue for me. if your husband comes fast he could probably wear it all the way through to orgasm and it will prevent semen from exiting the penis. ejaculation while wearing the ring could possibly cause some pain for him though - i ejaculated while wearing one a couple times and it caused some pain in my testicles. he could try it in order to know for sure. the pain in not unbearable and it will go away. additionally remember that there is nothing dirty about oral sex between a man and his wife. there are various techniques and tricks that my wife performs on me that make the experience absolutely incredible. the term ""variety is the spice of life"" can be applied to oral sex as well. biting and sucking the penis open-mouth breathing with penis inserted licking the frenulum while sucking going deep then pulling off slowly allowing the penis to slip through your teeth gripping the penis with your hand while sucking rubbing his nipples while sucking and holding ice cubes or a throat lozenge in your mouth while performing all make for a great experience for him. even pulling off and allowing him to get a breather causes wild sensations when you start back up a few seconds later. remember simply sucking the penis will not always get the job done. see what he likes. again practice makes perfect."

pancreatic cancer cannot be diagnosed by a simple blood test with borderline results but any person with abdominal discomfort for as long as you have suffered needs a very thorough diagnostic work-up and imaging studies. a reason for your nausea and diarrhea (as well as a solution) needs to be found. rather than just worry about pancreatic cancer you should continue the active pursuit as to the cause of your symptoms.
normally its better to have the blood test 10 days after having sex to give time for levels to go up to show a positive result. if you do a urine pregnancy test you normally do that maybe a couple days or the day after you missed your period.
there can be many causes for a babys fever. dehydration is one. or the infant might be over-bundled with clothes in a relatively warm environment. the rule of thumb is to dress your baby in just one more layer of clothing than you are comfortable in. most commonly fever is caused by an infection. the bodys immune system senses the foreign invader - such as bacteria or a virus - and sends a chemical message to the brains temperature center instructing it to crank up the heat inside the body. this has many advantages: some bacteria and viruses dont like the higher temperature and are then more easily destroyed by the immune system. the higher body temperature helps the body to ward off the infection. in this way fever is actually our friend: it lets us know that an infection may be brewing and it helps to fight off the infection.

i am assuming you are talking about a positive pregnancy test correct? breast tenderness is not a 100% certainty in early pregnancy so they do not have to be sore to validate this test. i suggest that you take the home test seriously. ask your doctor for a more sensitive lab test if you are not convinced.
you will ultimately want to have thisdiscussion with your pediatrician but when breastfeeding is established and ababy is gaining weight consistently it should be okay to nurse on demand. there may be times where you get longer stretches and that is okay. things to watch for however would be engorgement drop inmilk supply and signs of mastitis (breast infection). often times newborns will go through cluster feedingperiods around 3 and 6 weeks of age so i wouldn't be surprised to see morefrequent feedings in your near future. this happened to me when i was breastfeeding my daughter. she would sleep so much and i let her. my doctor said that aso long as she was gaining weight and having a normal sleep cycle (more at night less during the day) that i could let her sleep. my concern was that my milk continued to drop throughout the night so i would wake up every two to three hours to pump and then freeze the milk. this was great because when my daughter was about five weeks old i got sick and had to stop feeding for a short time due to the medicine that i was on. my suggestion is clearly to get all the sleep you can and just pump in between as necessary. i never had trouble with low milk supply when i did this.
technically yes. but in theory hardly anyone does this. i don't know what you are taking or what your doctor is treating so i cannot suggest an alternative dosage method. call the pharmacist that filled the medicine or the medical provider who prescribed it and ask for a better dosage schedule; one that you will likely be more compliant.
"a certain amount of sperm can be present and viable in some of the semen leakage that takes place during intercourse and foreplay. it is possible to get your girlfriend pregnant without ejaculating. of course you are only ""90% sure that you didn't"". i not clear how you came up with that statistic but i would be a bit concerned about the 10% chance that you did. i don't know if you girlfriend is pregnant or not but if you are both this sloppy about preventing pregnancy it's only a matter of time before it will happen. why in the world are you messing with mother nature? women are designed to get pregnant and men or designed to get them pregnant. by not being careful the inevitable will eventually happen. there are only a few days a month that a woman can conceive but sperm can lay in waiting for up to week in the vagina so if you left any of your little stragglers hanging around they have the potential of getting her pregnant. she may not be mid-cycle when ovulation typically takes place but why take the chance? don't be fools. if you and your girlfriend to not want to be parents but yet want to have risky sex practices then it would be in your mutual best interests to get some effective birth control or at least use a condom every time that you are having sex or engaged in this type of sexual play."
because of the nerve pathways a problem in the third molars can definitely cause referrred ear pain but not necessarily an ear infection.
sinusitis is most often the result of a viral infection that causes the mucous membrane lining the inside of the nose and the sinuses to become inflamed. the mucous membrane swells when it becomes inflamed blocking the drainage of fluid from the sinuses into the nose and throat. mucus and fluid build up inside the sinuses causing pressure and pain. bacteria are more likely to grow in sinuses that are unable to drain properly. bacterial infection in the sinuses often causes more inflammation and pain. while colds usually trigger this process any factor that causes the mucous membrane to become inflamed may lead to sinusitis. many people with nasal allergies ( allergic rhinitis ) for instance are likely to have recurring or long-term (chronic) sinus infections. nasal polyps foreign objects (usually in children) structural problems in the nose such as a deviated septum and other conditions can also block the nasal passages increasing the risk of developing sinusitis. fungal infections may also cause sinusitis. this is especially true in people with impaired immune systems. fungal sinusitis tends to be chronic and more difficult to treat than bacterial sinusitis. more information anatomy and physiology of the nasal cavity webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

federal employees are not eligible for cobra benefits but they are eligible for a benefit that functions similarly called temporary continuation of coverage (tcc). as is the case with cobra you will be able to continue her current health benefits for up to 18 months (assuming you're leaving voluntarily. involuntary separation from a federal job generally disqualifies you from being tcc eligible). you'll be responsible for paying the full cost of your health plan (your portion and the government's) plus a 2% administrative fee. you can see what those rates will amount to by checking the health premiums page on the u. s. office of personnel management website. to get the ball rolling you will need to fill out and submit to your human resources office a form (2809) for tcc enrollment. you can find the form at: www. opm. gov. you should submit paper work within 31 days from your final day of work but no later than 60 days after your job ends. if you miss the deadline you'll miss out on the opportunity to elect tcc. it's important to note that there is a 31-day extension period after your final day of work when health benefits will still be available to you at no cost. on the 32nd day after regular coverage comes to an end you'll have to begin paying your premium.
i'd wonder about a false pregnancy. sometimes the body can produce pregnancy symptoms when you are having a hormonal imbalance. the reason why i think that is because tubal ligation is pretty sure and the essure mesh has a 99. 8% effectiveness when properly implanted. so pregnancy would seem pretty unlikely. better check with your doctor.
i have read your question with care and understand your doubts regarding essential tremors. if not treated the person will not be able to do or will do with much difficulty works involving fingers like writing mixing food button shirts etc. activities which require co-ordinated movements of the fingers will be affected. essential tremors can be due to various reasons and a few of these reasons are transmitted genetically. a few are acquired. even among the ones which are transmitted genetically it can be ad ar xd xr that is autosomal dominant autosomal resistant x-linked dominant and x-linked resistant respectively. so unless we know the exact cause of this tremor we cannot answer about genetic transmission. without knowing the exact cause the answer for this question is 0 to 100 (0 for acquired and 100 for ad). the cure of essential tremor depends on the cause. a few causes can be cured completely a few causes can be controlled and a few cannot be cured at all. again the link with other illness and disorders depends on the cause of the tremor. coming to this particular patient who has this when going to new places or during anxiety this tremors can be controlled with proper medication. you have to consult a neurosurgeon who has had experience in successfully treating such patients for physical evaluation. for further information consult a neuro surgeon online

a skilled phlebotomist can find a vein by just feeling (palpating) it. a visual view is not necessary. apply a warm compress and allowing the arm to hang down prior to the blood draw would be helpful and ask for a phlebotomist that is skilled drawing blood from children! they are used to those tiny hard-to-find veins. i also had problems to see my veins. they turned me on my stomach and did the doppler tests and found this is the only way to see the deep veins which carry 80% of the blood back up and found i have a hereditary absence of large deep veins. my deep veins are the same size as the peripheral veins causing swelling and painful red spots that now limit my standing or sitting drastically. wearing compression stockings are the only relief they can prescribe. she may have this abnormally strange vein size as well. i'm looking for answers myself. good luck. i also had problems to see my veins. they turned me on my stomach and did the doppler tests and found this is the only way to see the deep veins which carry 80% of the blood back up and found i have a hereditary absence of large deep veins. my deep veins are the same size as the peripheral veins causing swelling and painful red spots that now limit my standing or sitting drastically. wearing compression stockings are the only relief they can prescribe. she may have this abnormally strange vein size as well. i'm looking for answers myself. good luck.

jevity is typically used as a tube feeding but other oral supplements like ensure or glucerna (if you are diabetic) can be used. the jackson siegelbaum diet has three steps the first being liquids. there may be times you go back to liquids when symptoms worsen. liquids and low fiber foods tend to be tolerated the best for people with gastroparesis. oral supplements also make sense when weight and nutrition is a concern due to inability to eat regular meals. if you are concerned about your nutrition you can always see a dietitian  you can find one at eatright. org. for more on diet for gastroparasis see this webmd article. good luck!
"a common problem among the babies of pregnant diabetic women is a condition called ""macrosomia "" which means ""large body. "" in other words babies of diabetic women are apt to be considerably larger than others. this occurs because many of these babies receive too much sugar via the placenta because their mothers have high blood sugar levels. the baby's pancreas senses the high sugar levels and it produces more insulin in an attempt to use up all the extra sugar. that extra sugar is converted to fat making a large baby. sometimes the baby becomes too large to be delivered vaginally and a cesarean delivery becomes necessary. your doctor will closely monitor the size of your baby and will plan for the safest mode of delivery for you and your baby. if you have high blood sugar levels consistently during pregnancy (especially in the 24 hours before delivery) your baby may develop dangerously low blood sugars right after delivery. this is because the baby has high levels of insulin to use up the extra sugars but that source of sugar is suddenly taken away leaving high insulin levels so their blood sugar levels drop quickly. thus your doctor will check your baby's blood sugar levels after birth. if it's low your baby will be given glucose intravenously. your baby may also have mineral imbalances such as calcium or magnesium which can be replaced with medication."
there are several aspects to treating menstrual migraines: to treat menstrual migraine take medications after the onset. generally medications that are effective in stopping nonmenstrual migraines are effective at also treating menstrual migraines. to prevent menstrual migraine take medications just before the onset of menstruation and continue for the duration of the expected headache. taking hormones such as estrogens or estrogen-related medications also help to prevent migraine. to reduce the frequency and duration of menstrual migraine take prophylactic medications (such as beta-blockers calcium channel blockers anticonvulsants tricyclic antidepressants) that are normally used on a continuous basis to prevent nonmenstrual migraines. nsaids such as naproxen sodium (aleve) or ibuprofen (advil motrin) have been used effectively to treat menstrual migraines. a combination analgesic containing acetaminophen aspirin and caffeine (acc) can also be used to treat menstrual migraines. for women whose menstruation and menstrual migraines occur on a regular and predictable pattern nsaids may be used 24 hours before the expected onset of menstrual migraine and continued for the expected duration of the headache. since nsaids inhibit prostaglandins they have the added benefit of relieving menstrual cramps as well. triptans (naratriptan rizatriptan sumatriptan zolmitriptan) have been found to be effective in treating menstrual migraines as well as controlling the associated nausea and vomiting. sumatriptan given two to three days before and continued for the duration of the expected headache is effective in reducing the frequency and severity of menstrual migraine. naratriptan used in the same manner has also been found to be effective in preventing menstrual migraine. however in those cases where breakthrough headaches occurred they were just as severe as in patients taking placebo. dihydroergotamine (dhe) can be used as a nasal spray or given intramuscularly or intravenously to stop menstrual migraines. ergotamine (oral rectal or intranasal) and dhe (intranasal intramuscular or intravenous) can be used around the time of menstruation (several days before and continued for the duration of the expected headache) to prevent menstrual migraines. if these medications are ineffective doctors may try daily preventive medications such as beta-blockers anticonvulsants calcium channel blockers and tricyclic antidepressants to reduce the frequency and the severity of menstrual migraines. the choice of the preventive medications is based on the experiences and preferences of the doctor the medication side effects and the woman's other associated medical conditions. for women already taking preventive medications who still experience headaches the doses of preventive medications can be increased around the time of menstruation. (some doctors use preventive medications only around the time of menstruation. ) alternatively doctors may try hormone treatment. since a drop in estrogen level just prior to menstruation is the trigger for menstrual migraines estrogen replacement before menstruation has been used in preventing menstrual migraines. for some women with menstrual migraine estradiol skin patches (such as tts 50 tts 100) applied two days before menstrual migraine and continued for seven days during the expected headache period is effective. however the dose of estrogen must be closely monitored as too high of a dose can actually trigger migraine in susceptible individuals. some women with difficult-to-treat menstrual migraines may be helped by using low-dose oral contraceptives to reduce the estrogen fluctuations. other less frequently used medications for menstrual migraines include tamoxifen bromocriptine danazol and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh).
"migraines are vascular headaches and not all headaches are ""migraines"". migraine does not mean a severe headache it is just one type of over a hundred different kinds of headaches. the type of headache you may be describing is one of the more common types. a muscle-tension headache but the pain under the breast is not a typical symptom. muscle-tension headache can certainly come from the neck. since you cannot be blindly diagnosed over the internet i would suggest that you see your medical provider for a proper examination."

in my opinion first take an antihistaminic for example hyroxizine to stop itching second this can be either simple contact dermatitis or celullitis if it is celluitis you will need to have a strong antibiotic course of treatment i recommend you see a dermatologist to be safe contact dermatitis will improve on dose of 10mg hydroyzine every 12 hours also hydrocortisol cream should fix it (hydrocortisol cream can make cellulitis worse) so confirm your diagnosise at a dermatologist firstgood luck
there r two types of herpes. there r the oral kind and then there is genital kind. yes u can get herpes on your genitals from a cold sore. but even tho it is herpes on your genitals it is not actually the genital type of herpes. it is the oral type actually. u can spread each type to each area. yes her giving u head with a what looks like mainly healed sore can give u herpes. i have kissed a chick with a sore before to and didn't get nothing. some times your just lucky or perhaps your immune system is working harder and better at times i don't know. but u can get on acyclovir twice a day from your doctor it's herpes meds. or if u don't have insurance there is a natural pill for it u can get at health stores or what have u called l-lysine and take it twice a day and have her take it as well. hell even once a day would b good.

assuming they go outside in the yard to do their business having them vaccinated is a good idea. we have had rabid skunks in our fenced yard in the past so i am glad my three dogs are immunized. i take them to the vet the groomers and to the dog park where they can be exposed to other animals who may not be immunized so again i am glad that i spend a few extra dollars to protect my best friends.
you must be more thoughtful about what you're eating. focus on and savor the flavors in your food. as we get older our metabolism does slow down a bit. so learning to eat mindfully early is a good thing for the long run. dont eat out of bags or packages. put your food on a plate and take the time to enjoy your food while you eat. eating too fast or while your attention is elsewhere may lead you to eat more than you realize. pay attention to your hunger and fullness cues before during and after your meals and snacks. use these cues to determine when you will eat and when you should stop eating.

i would advise you to ask the doctor. honestly you have a completely valid question there and the doctor not only will give you advice specific to your situation but may change the method of wound closure to accommodate your needs if he knows this in advance. there's no way to estimate whether or not it will be safe for you to have sex a week after your surgery because many different factors come into play: the exact location of the mole the size of the incision condom usage etc. please don't feel shy about asking your doctor about this. trust me he will take your question seriously. wishing you well!

for the greatest overall health benefits experts suggest 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise on most (and preferably all) days of the week. doing aerobic activity for most of the days and strength (anaerobic) training two to three days of the week is recommended for best results. if you have been inactive for a while you may want to start with less strenuous activities such as walking or swimming at a comfortable pace. once you are in better shape you can gradually do more strenuous activity.
enlarged tonsils and lymph nodes are not uncommon and can stay swollen for quite a while after an infection. if you are concerned about their size and appearance it would be wise to be examined by an ent specialist.
that would depend on your goal. if you live in a highly-humid wet environment a dehumidifier would pull water out of the air to a more comfortable area. if your forced-air heating tends to dry your environment as it often does some extra humidity in the air will make your inside air quality more breathable. it is really a personal choice since there could be needs for both depending on the time of year the season health status and your geographic area.
i don't believe that massage will end her nerve pain but it can help relax her a bit. a massage works better to help muscle pain. a medication can be prescribed to help with the nerve pain by making the nerve endings less sensitive. cymbalta is one of the medications that works well. if your sister does not have open sores then she can't pass it to the therapist.

eggs are not released during a menstrual period; they are released during ovulation (mid-cycle). usually one egg is released monthly but sometime more than one can pop out. fertilization of more than one egg will result in fraternal twins. or triplets. or more. sometimes an egg is not released at all (anovulatory cycle).

"in brief: minimal outside time to avoid spread of covid-19, use precautions such as staying home as much as possible avoid contact with others until the infection rate begins to decline. monitor your temperature, rest and drink fluids. on day 7 post contact if you have no symptoms, most likely you are fine. continue to use good hand washing and keep surfaces clean. would you like to video or text chat with me?"
no! there has not been sufficient testing done on the effects of using a whitening gel while pregnant. until such studies have been done on a larger scale it is best to err on the side of caution. manufacturers of teeth whitening products and teeth bleaching products generally recommend against using them during pregnancy for liability reasons. however common sense dictates that unnecessarily ingesting anything should be especially avoided during pregnancy.
be vigilant. if you are in a hotel check the bed before you go to sleep. and when you return home wash everything in hot water. bedbugs cant survive temperatures above 113 degrees fahrenheit. as for hospitals youre right. they are not necessarily bedbug-free zones. the national pest management association says 12% of its pros treated hospitals for bedbugs last year.
hi try this its a post of mine on how to take cayenne pepper turmeric and garlic these 3 are good for hbp ra and a lot more all you have to do is google then for hbp or ra its all there. plaque is a big problem with hbp so this clears that away. the way out and clearing away plaque would be to get on cayenne pepper turmeric and garlic take this each morning and see how you go. its all very healthy for you. you just mix cp and turmeric 50/50 in olive oil and then mix with tomato paste and thin it with olive oil at first you just mix this to a heat that suits you and over time you can slowly increase the cp and turmeric. you take 3 teaspoonfuls each morning first thing you wash each spoonful down with water before anything else just after you get up one thing it will warm you up with this which will also help would be very fine chopped garlic just do a whole head chopped fine and keep in olive oil with this you add dried parsley a couple of good desert spoonfuls and mix you just add a teaspoonful on top of the cp an turmeric mix just mix into the top take as said. the parsley its very good for the blood and helps keep your cholesterol down. please do keep both jars in the fridge keeps a lot better that way. now if you google and read up about all three there very good for ed your cholesterol heart and prostate and ra garlic is also very good for your blood so along with the cp and turmeric your be doing your body the world of good. at first you really need to be taken this 3 times a day the other 2 times just before meals for 2 weeks then just twice a day for 2 weeks then just the once at first thing in the mornings great way to start the day. and yes have had ed now in recovery and do take what is above daily along with other supplements and a hormone. so do hope this helps you. good luck ps this really needs a 12 week trail to see if its going to work for you if its for ra do increase it up the stronger it is the better it works for you. dont forget to up the amount of cp and turmeric as you go on. one last piece of info some cp i got out here in greece was not very hot so changed shops and using a 50/50 mix of cp and chilli powder this i put a heaped teaspoon on top each day along with a heaped teaspoon of turmeric now from a site im on they say to help turmeric get absorbed to take a Â¼ teaspoon of black pepper with it what a great way to light a fire in your stomach to get the day started.
hi maintain hemoglobin levels by starting hematinics. try and find out the cause of bleeding from mouth as well as stools. fresh blood may be due to oesophageal varieces and hemorrhoids. occult dark blood can be due to intestinal lesions. endoscopy will help to confirm the diagnosis. lfts should be done. thanks
not enough information here. periphreal vascular disease in my experience refers to the extremities. peripheral neuropathy i think refers to small vessel ischemia in the brain. pretty common in old folks. heart failure is so vague. is it congestive heart failure? have lived 8 years. is this an 8 year old child? more information is needed. there is a place on here to ask a real doctor. i'd like to know more. ps: when you ask a question and they only give you 120 elements to ask which isn't enough there's a place right below that to ask a new question where you can add addition info to the same question. i hope this isn't an 8 year old child.
very little still see a doctor though because if you aren't pregnant you may still have another health concern.
the destruction of the inner lining of the small intestine in celiac disease is caused by an immunological (allergic) reaction to gluten in the diet that inflames and destroys the inner lining of the small intestine. there is evidence that this reaction is partially genetic and inherited. thus approximately 10% of first-degree relatives (parents siblings or children) of individuals with celiac disease also will have celiac disease. in addition in approximately 30% of fraternal twins and 70% of identical twins both twins will have celiac disease. finally certain genes have been found to be more common among individuals with celiac disease than among individuals without celiac disease. gluten is a family of proteins present in wheat. some of the proteins that make up gluten (the ones that are dissolved by alcohol) are called gliadin. it is the gliadin in gluten that causes the immunological reaction in celiac disease. the mechanism whereby gliadin becomes toxic (damaging) is not clear; however much scientific study is being done and we are beginning to understand the mechanism. proteins including gliadin are long chains of amino acids-up to several hundredattached to each other. normally during digestion digestive enzymes within the small intestine break-up proteins into single amino acids and smaller chains of amino acids. this is necessary because the intestine only can absorb single amino acids or at most chains of 3-4 amino acids. single amino acids and chains of several amino acids do not cause problems for the intestine. it appears however that gliadin is not completely broken-up by intestinal enzymes. several longer chains of amino acids remain intact. somehow these larger chains enter the cells lining the intestine perhaps because the cells are abnormally permeable (leaky) to longer chains of amino acids. some of these longer chains are toxic (damaging) to the intestinal cells. one of the longer chains attaches to an enzyme within the cells tissue transglutaminase. in individuals with celiac disease the complex of the longer chain of amino acids and tissue transglutaminase sets off an immune reaction that attacks the complex and at the same time damages the intestinal cells. barley and rye contain gliadin-like proteins and can cause celiac disease in genetically-predisposed individuals. oats also contain gliadin-like proteins but unlike barley and rye the gliadin-like proteins in oats cause inflammation weakly and in only a few individuals who are predisposed to develop celiac disease. rice and corn do not cause celiac disease because they do not contain gliadin-like proteins.
you may have a prolapsed uterus or perhaps a cystocele/rectocele. it is very important for you to see an ob/gyn for a proper examination.
maybe. it depends on the culture. most stool cultures are for bacteria but some check for other organisms. certainly gonorrhea may be detected but perhaps not chlamydia. if you are concerned that you have been exposed to an std from anal sex you need to specifically ask to be std tested so the right tests can be performed. as noted in the previous answer a stool culture is usually done to detect other bacterial infections not stds. if there has been anal sex the testing should include a swab of the anal area but not a stool samplein some cases the presence of stool/feces leads to inaccurate results. when getting tested for stds you can request to be tested for oral and anal transmission in addition to regular testing of vagina/penis.
sorry to hear that this is a stage 4 lung cancer in stage 4 chemotherapy is often the recommended course of treatment. immunotherapies may also be recommended as a secondary approach. i recommend also sticking to a full vegetarian antioxidant alkaline diet with some multivitamin supplement powder as ensure powder.
thalassemia seems to be the cause. this is causing destruction of blood cells and leading to hypoxic spells. thalassemia needs to be corrected first. bone marrow examination needs a consideration
you are suffering from anxiety. as a result you are over focusing on one particular condition which are allergies. the more you think of it the more anxiety you develop. if you need to address your allergies consult an allergist. just get your mind off of it. allergies are a very common problem. and not life threatening.
genital warts (condyloma) are growths or bumps on the penis vagina vulva (vaginal lips) cervix (the opening between the vagina and womb) rectum or groin. genital warts are a sexually transmitted disease (std) which means that they are spread by having sex with an infected person.
there are no viruses or bacteria that only cause bronchitis. any of the hundreds of respiratory organisms can do. most cases (nearly all) of bronchitis in children (i don't know your daughter's age) are viral and do not require antibiotics; ear infections often do not require them either but antibiotics have remained the mainstay of treatment. ear infections are not contagious. respiratory viruses are considered most contagious a day before you get sick and for about two days afterwards. since it has been a week your daughter is not likely contagious even if she still has some residual symptoms like a cough.
there are subsidies to help people with low incomes pay for health insurance. take a look at your options on healthcare. gov to see what you might qualify for.
well the baby can be comparitively smaller but not necessarily dwarf. but for confirmation amniocentesis can be done. baby measuring less than 18 inches at birth is generally considered to be having some skeletal dysplasia. so you need to discuss with your gynaecologist who can check for factors like head size amniotic fluid around baby along with limb size and can also discuss about amniocentesis to proceed further. hope this helps.
your question is an important one for women with epilepsy who wish to have a family. there is little scientific information on this subject and most of what we know if based on clinical experience of doctors taking care of women with epilepsy. the bottom line is that most physicians with expertise in managing epilepsy encourage their patients to breastfeed even if they are taking anti-seizure medicine. the baby has developed for nine months in the presence of the anti-seizure medicine and as such for the baby to continue to be exposed to it after delivery usually does not create problems. i am unaware of any [known] descriptions of problems with breastfeeding while on trileptal (oxcarbazepine). if blood levels are done in mom and her baby while breastfeeding the baby's level will be around half of the mother's. so the baby is definitely getting some of the drug but it usually does not create problems as best we tell. so if breastfeeding is important to you (as it is for most women) most experts in the field would encourage you to breastfeed.
although i recommend doing it in a surgery center (if you are a relative of me). but it is not going to affect the procedure itself if you are sure about the sterilization and cleanliness of the clinic and devices. you should go home at once with some analgesics and vitamins prescribed. physiotherapy is advised after procedures. good luck.
in my opinion this is contact dermatitis i suggest use on hydrocortisone cream and diphenhydramine however if this does not help then you should see a professional dermatologist and stop all treatment immediately good luck
"you are most likely to come down with diarrhea after coming into contact with these infectious organisms and agents: a virus such as rotavirus norwalk agent enterovirus or a hepatitis virus. a bacterium such as e. coli salmonella shigella clostridium or vibrio cholerae. a parasite such as those that cause giardiasis and amebiasis. you may pick up an infectious agent from contact with another individual who has it or you may get it after eating contaminated food or drinking contaminated water. if you eat food that was improperly cooked or was contaminated after cooking you may get food poisoning which can lead to diarrhea. children who attend day care and their families are more likely to be exposed to certain infectious agents. many people who travel to foreign countries develop what is termed ""traveler's diarrhea "" usually after drinking contaminated water. infectious diarrhea is a particular hazard in developing countries where it may be difficult to keep waste water and sewage separate from water used for cooking drinking and bathing and where inadequate facilities make it difficult to practice good personal hygiene. other medical conditions a number of noninfectious medical conditions may cause diarrhea too. these include: inability to digest certain foods including a lactose intolerance (difficulty digesting sugar found in dairy products); celiac disease (inability to digest wheat and sometimes other grains); and pancreatic problems such as those caused by cystic fibrosis which interfere with production of important digestive substances. surgery to remove part of your small intestine. a shortened small intestine may be unable to absorb all the substances you eat. this is referred to as short-bowel syndrome. surgery after removal of the gallbladder. an increase in bile in the colon may result in watery stools. certain diseases of the endocrine (hormonal) system including overactive thyroid disease diabetes adrenal disease and zollinger-ellison syndrome. certain rare tumors (including carcinoid tumor and pheochromocytoma) that produce diarrhea-causing substances (hormones). inflammation in the intestinal tract which can result in chronic diarrhea. if you have inflammatory bowel disease (such as ulcerative colitis or crohn's disease) you will have regular bouts of diarrhea during a flare-up of your disease. sometimes people who develop bumps in their intestine from diverticulitis also get diarrhea. irritable bowel syndrome which may cause alternating bouts of diarrhea and constipation. medications and other substances many medications can cause diarrhea. some of the most common include antacids containing magnesium laxatives digitalis diuretics a number of antibiotics chemotherapy drugs cholesterol-lowering agents lithium theophylline thyroid hormone and colchicine. radiation therapy for prostate cancer or cancers in the abdomen can damage the intestine and cause diarrhea. toxins such as insecticides psychedelic mushrooms and arsenic can cause diarrhea and overuse of caffeine or alcohol may contribute to diarrhea."
hi. iÌn patients with chronic diseases hospital admission can be essential if symptoms like severe shortness of breath and loss of consciousness occurs. specially if it is complicated pneumonia.

with the earnings you describe for a family of 6 your son and daughter-in-law and their children will no doubt qualify for medicaid which will provide them with insurance at no cost. however they'll need to see if their state is expanding its program. you can check healthcare. gov to find out more information or webmd's state pages. even if medicaid is not an option for the whole family because they live in a state that isn't expanding its program it's likely that the kids will still qualify. and without medicaid if the lowest cost health insurance plan amounts to more than 8% of their annual income they will not be required to buy insurance.
for total fitness a pregnancy exercise program should strengthen and condition your muscles. always begin by warming up for five minutes and stretching for five minutes. include at least fifteen minutes of cardiovascular activity. measure your heart rate at times of peak activity. follow aerobic activity with five to ten minutes of gradually slower exercise that ends with gentle stretching. here are some basic exercise guidelines for pregnant women: wear loose fitting comfortable clothes as well as a good support bra. choose shoes that are designed for the type of exercise you do. proper shoes are your best protection against injury. exercise on a flat level surface to prevent injury. consume enough calories to meet the needs of your pregnancy (300 more calories per day than before you were pregnant) as well as your exercise program. finish eating at least one hour before exercising. drink water before during and after your workout. after doing floor exercises get up slowly and gradually to prevent dizziness. never exercise to the point of exhaustion. if you cannot talk normally while exercising you are probably over-exerting yourself and should slow down your activity.

"i'd recommend you get this checked by a doctor. several things can cause the symptoms you're describing from a yeast infection to a sexually transmitted disease. it's very important you get an accurate diagnosis in order to receive the correct treatment for the problem. some itching in the vaginal area is normal. the rash you described isn't normal nor is the ""cut"" or the extreme burning while taking a bath. while this is not an emergency situation i hope you're able to see a doctor soon to find out what's going on. meanwhile i would urge you to avoid having sex just in case you do have a sexually transmitted disease such as genital herpes or genital warts. you do not want to give your partner a disease. i wish you all the best!"
it would be unlikely but if your concerned the best thing you can do is take a test.
in brief: local issue when or where testing is available is a local issue. your post does not reveal your location or even the country you are in. we have no access to or information about health plans or services around the world where this site can be seen. you will need to contact a local health department for such information. would you like to video or text chat with me?
"there's a new duke university study that presented findings showing that although many doctors are trying to talk to their patients about weight managment it's mostly ineffective. the researchers found that the most successful doctors used a motivational and empathetic way of talking about weight. ""hey i know it's difficult to drop the pounds so why don't we team on this together. you know i've been there i'll share some secrets of my own success. sound good? "" their patients dropped 3. 5 pounds within 3 months of seeing their doc. the least successful were those who were judgemental and/or confrontational. ""if you don't drop the weight you'll get diabetes and heart disease. get a grip and start the program i gave you. i want 5 pounds off by the next time i see you. "" these patients dropped no weight and most gained."
hi if you have been having unprotected sex then it could be implantation day if your next period does not come just wait a week then see your doctor and get tested there but a good doctor will know if you are pregnant ok hope this helps you. good luck
"the short answer for you and other seniors with medicare is that health reform will have little or no impact on medicare customers. if you have medicare drug coverage your part d plans will actually provide greater coverage for the ""donut hole"" under medicare. but other wise there are no changes. and if you buy a medicare supplement policy (i think what you are referring to with ""part f"") there will be no impact on those policies."
"yes when you take an antibiotic it kills not only the offending bacteria but all of the good bacteria in your system as well. the problem then is with the good bacteria gone bad bacteria can get into your system when you go off the antibiotic. it sounds like you need to get good bacteria back in your system. eat yogurt with ""live cultures"" or find supplements that say probitoic. if you are still having problems after maybe a week call your doctor and see what they say."
hi. you are right. raised ama levels are confirmatory of hashimotos disease. there is no serious complication apart from being associated with other auto immune diseases elsewhere in the body. another rare complication is thyroid lymphoma. there is no permanent cure. u just have to keep the thyroid levels within nrmal range. which you already have. so no need to panic. thanks
"sometimes, even after you get treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration, the condition can come back. test your vision regularly and follow the recommendations of your doctor. the right treatment not only slows your vision loss, but it can improve your vision."
in a word no. remember the last time you had the flu and couldnt keep anything down? yep you did drop some weight most of it water weight and perhaps a pound or two of fat depending upon the length of non-eating time. however as you recovered you probably also remember in vivid detail how your hunger kicked in big time and before you knew it youd compensated for the weight loss and then some. this is actually a beautiful example of how incredible your body is when you provide it with a survival challenge.
virtually all viruses are contagious. if you are susceptible. adults tend to carry a certain level of immunity to many viruses (and there are hundreds of them) so exposure does not necessarily mean you will catch it. or even have the same viral response. respiratory viruses are usually contagious a day before you know you are sick and for two days afterward. since i do not know the bug that has plagued your other family members i can't address your issue specifically but time with family is important. and sometimes you just have to take a chance. we all take chances going out the grocery store or restaurants but we go anyway.
this seems to be a gastroenteritis. drink plenty of water. you may take metronidazole for 5 days if the fever and diarrhea did not go after 2 days then you need to see your git specialist.

there should not be a problem. as a matter of fact a stool softener may be beneficial.
i would not be able to offer you a specific reason unless i was able to get a full medical history and examination. sex per se does not cause a true menstrual cycle to start but sex can cause bleeding. perhaps this is not your period at all but rather some post-coital bleeding. your menstrual cycle is regulated by your hormones and sex will not instantly alter those very powerful hormones. i would strongly suggest that you see a women's health care professional and have an examination. this is how you find your answer.
call your doctor.
the pain reliever of choice for pregnant women is acetaminophen (brand name: tylenol). acetaminophen can be used safely during all trimesters of pregnancy. it is not recommended to use ibuprofen (brand name: advil or motrin) or naproxen (brand name: aleve).
yes. yeast can be transmitted to a susceptible partner.

melatonin actually has some data in regards to children dosing. anywhere from 2-5 milligrams could be used in a child but once again we want to find out why is the child not sleeping. pediatrician should always be consulted first before even starting any types of medications like this. it could be related to possibly they are starting school they are anxious maybe they are not sleeping at night because their room is noisy. so we have to find out really what are the root causes of the problems rather than go right ahead to medicating them. so as a pharmacist i would say to patients you know what let's talk to the pediatrician first and let's see what's going on before we start a child on melatonin. you know with most of these products once again we don't really have a lot of data to go by. so we don't know long-term use in some of these products how it's going to affect the child. children are not little adults. a lot of people i think are confused by that. their livers and their kidneys are not developed like yours and mine. so when they get a drug or they get any type of product in them they are going to react a lot differently than we are. so we want to make sure that people exercise caution.
"i hope you have not taken yourself off your medications without medical supervision. that's dangerous and unwise. no one should stop taking antipsychotic and antidepressant medications without talking it over with their psychiatrist and developing a plan to deal with any crises that arise. to answer your question i don't know of any medical reason why your blood pressure would spike due to tapering off seroquel or wellbutrin. however you could experience greater feelings of stress after discontinuing those medications and this could lead to an increase in blood pressure. if your blood pressure reading was elevated only one time it's probably nothing to be concerned about. if you're noticing it remains elevated consistently then you should make an appointment with your doctor for an evaluation. generally speaking consistently elevated pressures in the 140 range do constitute hypertension (high blood pressure). that said 140 is considered the ""low end"" of the high blood pressure scale. this doesn't mean it should go untreated however. wishing you well!"
you know that is a good question. let me start off with this. the question of the medium complected person the olive skinned patient that has perhaps brown eyes what do we do for them because ive stated that they are not the perfect candidate. well there are people who kind of fall into youre probably okay type department. what we do there is rather than guess what the result would be we do what we call a patch test or a demo. we take a little bit of the chemical we put it on the skin of the forehead usually under where the hair would conceal it and we test the skin kind of like paint companies test paint put it out in the sun for a few months. were going to see how that skin behaves and were going to see what the end color is. now we may have to wait 3 to 6 months. it may take that long for the pink color to fade and for the skin to get to the ultimate color its going to be. most of the time itll be lighter but in some people it could be darker and wed like to know that. now its a color issue for these people. its not an issue of a greater chance of other serious complications like scarring or the white bumps its strictly the color. but that is important because people would like to have uniform color and natural look. but we also have to remind that patient that since most peoples skin will lighten up a little bit if they have a reasonable amount of pigment then theres a potential color difference between the treated face and the untreated neck. now that can be concealed with makeup and not necessarily heavy makeup but the patient needs to know that going in because there are some women for example who say but i dont ever wear makeup and i dont want to wear makeup and if im going to look like ive got a color difference then maybe this isnt for me and i agree it isnt for them. but if we can show them by the patch test the sample test the demo what the outcome will be then they can make a better decision. we still have to deal with the patient who has some darkness and increased darkness from sun damage and there are less intense ways to deal with even if a patient does develop pigmentation because perhaps they went out in the sun a little too soon or perhaps they went water skiing and washed off their sunscreen we do have bleach creams that are very effective within 4 to 6 weeks when applied once a day will bleach out that pigment. really? yeah not the extent of michael jackson bleach but to get us back to the baseline. yes we have some wonderful products that are available today all basically from good research.
"problems with thinking, or cognitive delays, may be due to one or more of these reasons:"
risk factors for parkinson's disease are difficult to identify because the cause of the disease is unknown. advancing age is the only known risk factor for typical parkinson's disease (not including early-onset parkinson's). most instances of parkinson's disease occur after age 50 although the illness does occur in people between the ages of 30 and 50 or in rare cases at a younger age. a very small number of people with parkinson's have a close relative who also has the disease but it does not appear that a family history of typical parkinson's disease significantly increases your risk of developing the disease. having a family history of the disease is a more significant risk factor in cases of early-onset parkinson's disease but this form of the disease is not common. some research suggests that long-term exposure to certain environmental factors such as pesticides chemicals or well water may increase a person's risk of developing parkinson's disease but this has not been proven. there are many other causes of parkinsonism which is a group of symptoms that includes tremor muscle stiffness slow movement and unsteady walking. parkinsonism mimics parkinson's disease but in fact is not parkinson's disease. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

white filled acne will eventually heal itself unpopped but whatever you do don't pop acne that is not ripe or white as scarring will result. i used to have a similar problem with acne in middle and high school years and have been prescribed creams to medication but none truly worked. i then researched online and noticed a lot of acne comes from the food that you eat and deficiencies in zinc and vitamin a and c. i went to a local cvs and purchased zinc tablets which helps in reducing oil levels from a range of 35-100mg a day. be careful as overdose can occur with excessive amounts. i also began eating carrots and foods with vitamin c which can be googled. if scarring happens you should invest in apple cider vinegar and apply to a cotton ball and place on scar for a couple of minutes before the shower which helps removing old skin layers and making new ones. that has helped my scars tremendously after 1-2 months! then in the shower i recommend a body wash that has vitamin e in it for a good clean moisturizer which will help your skin as well. it all starts with the diet and cutting all the greasy oily food. fight your acne from the inside then out and you will see the results. hope this helps

"you can get hpv, or human papillomavirus, through vaginal, anal, or oral sex. the virus spreads through skin-to-skin contact. using a condom may not fully protect you. the only way to be sure not to catch hvp is to avoid any type of sexual contact. you also can lower your chances for an infection by limiting the number of your sexual partners, or by choosing partners whoï¿½ve had no or few sex partners before you. vaccines work well to guard against some of the more dangerous strains of hpv. theyï¿½re available to children as young as 9 and to adults up to age 26."

"after gastric sleeve weight loss surgery it's very important to get enough protein to help with healing and recovery. this is something you should ask your doctor as everyone is different. in general most people need about 60 to 75 grams of protein a day. protein is important for long-term weight maintenance as well since it helps you feel full longer. due to malnutrition after weight loss surgery some people may also lose some hair. protein can help with that as well. but again you should ask your doctor how much is right for you and also to get suggestions on the type of protein since it's important to get ""complete proteins. "" that means all the amino acids that help make up protein in the body. meats are complete proteins but most non-meat proteins are not. but if you combine certain proteins such as rice and beans you can get all the amino acids in one meal."
hi no not a very good idea to keep going on and off you need 7 days before your safe they always say to use back protection when going on the pill like condoms. look see your doctor and ask about the mini pill it only has one hormone perhaps this may help you with your mood swings if not try thinking about the copper iud no hormones in that. or try the cap and spermicide again no hormones. do hope this helps you good luck
any time that you have unprotected sex the possibility of pregnancy must be considered. since you hade a tubal ligation 14 years ago most of these are 100% successful in achieving surgical sterilization so that chance of pregnancy while not impossible is remote. since some tubal ligations fail (for various reasons) other causes for your array of symptoms like hormonal fluctuations should be medically-investigated by a gynecologist.
here are a few guidelines to keep yourself from doing too much exercise or exercising too vigorously: gradually increase your activity level especially if you have not been exercising regularly. wait at least one and a half hours after eating a meal before exercising. when drinking liquids during exercise remember to follow your fluid restriction guidelines. take time to include a five-minute warm-up including stretching exercises before any aerobic activity and include a five- to 10-minute cool down after the activity. stretching can be done while standing or sitting. exercise at a steady pace. keep a pace that allows you to still talk during the activity. keep an exercise record.
"i wish i could explain this but it's impossible to know what happened without knowing the specifics involved. percocet (generic name: oxycodone-apap) is an oral tablet taken by swallowing. usually post-surgical pain is treated with intravenous (iv) medication not pills. it's possible your post-surgical blood pressure issues had nothing to do with the percocet. normally low blood pressure in the recovery room is treated with iv fluids. i don't know what ""reversal drug"" you were given for the percocet. i'm going to assume you received naloxone (brand name: narcan). i don't know why this would cause you to feel as if you were having a heart attack. i could speculate but that would be of no use. if you are truly concerned about this i advise taking it up with the surgeon who performed your knee replacement surgery. he should have access to the anesthesia and nursing records that show exactly what medications you were given the times they were given and the dosages you received. perhaps your surgeon could shed some light on what happened. wishing you well!"
the best thing you should do is go to your doctor. for one - a urine or blood pregnancy test two - any other tests or exams on both you & your partner like fertilization test on your bodys see if you're healthy normal crap like that and to see if there could be anything else wrong. go see your doctor they'll ask you questions and you should ask him/her questions that you want/need to know or anything youre concerned about they'll give you the best answer honestly.
most strokes are due to a blood clot in the brain which is essentially the same thing that causes a heart attack. for this type of stroke we would recommend the same changes in the diet as those recommended to people with heart disease. if your cholesterol is high you need to take the necessary steps to lower it. that means decreasing your saturated fat intake (found mostly in meat and high-fat animal products like whole milk). you also want to decrease fat intake overall by cutting back on desserts butter creamy sauces etc. and losing weight when needed can play a large role in bringing your cholesterol down. many people who've suffered from a stroke need medication to get their cholesterol down and to prevent future strokes. but diet changes are still very important even for people taking medication. exercise can also help prevent another stroke but make sure to check with your doctor to find the right type of exercise for you.

"this is an excellent question and i'm glad you asked. according to the u. s. centers for disease control and prevention's (cdc) shingles vaccine fact sheet you do not need to avoid contact with infants after receiving the shingles vaccine. the cdc website states: ""it is safe to be around infants and young children pregnant women or people with weakened immune systems after you get the shingles vaccine. there is no documentation of a person getting chickenpox from someone who has received the shingles vaccine. "" however if you develop a rash around the injection site you should cover it until it disappears. hope this helps! i received the shingles vaccine on sunday. monday and tuesday night i had a difficult time sleeping due to the pain. my arm has a large hard knot is red slight rash hot to touch itching and painful. is this normal?"
the most important thing you can do is drink plenty of fluids. if youre drinking enough your urine should be clear or light yellow. if you have calcium kidney stones  the most common type  eating less salt or salty foods may help. watch out for salt content in processed foods and in restaurants. you do not need to avoid calcium-rich foods and they may even help prevent another type of kidney stone being oxalate kidney stones. if you have oxalate kidney stones limiting foods high in oxalate may help such as dark green vegetables nuts and chocolate. other diet changes that may help include not eating too much protein increasing your fiber intake avoiding grapefruit juice and drinking real lemonade since the citrate from real lemons may help prevent kidney stones. if you take supplements ask your doctor about how much calcium and c and d vitamins you should be taking since these may increase your risk of kidney stones.
good health prior and during pregnancy will help you reduce your risk of complications. here are some general recommendations. be sure to get enough folic acid in your diet. the current recommendation for women of childbearing age is to take a daily supplement containing at least 0. 4 mg of folic acid in addition to consuming foods naturally rich in folic acid. folic acid is naturally contained in leafy green vegetables dried beans liver and some citrus fruits. limit your caffeine consumption. do not have more than 300 mg of caffeine per day. the caffeine content in various drinks depends on the beans or leaves used and how it is prepared. an 8-ounce cup of coffee has about 150 mg on average while black tea has about 80 mg of caffeine. a 12-ounce glass of caffeinated soda contains anywhere from 30 to 60 mg of caffeine. remember chocolate contains caffeine  the amount of caffeine in a chocolate bar is equal to 1/4 cup of coffee. maintain a healthy well-balanced diet and eat a variety of foods to get all the nutrients you need. choose foods high in starch and fiber. make sure you are getting enough vitamins and minerals in your daily diet. eat and drink at least four servings of dairy products and calcium-rich foods a day choose at least one source each of vitamin c vitamin a and folic acid every day. exercise regularly. review your exercise program with your health care provider. generally you may continue your normal exercise routine throughout pregnancy unless you are instructed to decrease or modify your activities. don't drink alcohol during pregnancy and don't use any medications unless recommended by your doctor. don't smoke during pregnancy. in addition be sure to obtain prenatal care especially early in your pregnancy. the first eight weeks are especially critical in your baby's development. early and regular prenatal care (health care during pregnancy) can increase your chances of having a healthy baby. regular appointments with your health care provider throughout your pregnancy are important to monitor your health and prevent or control any problems that develop during pregnancy. in addition to medical care prenatal care includes education on pregnancy and childbirth plus counseling and support.

unfortunately humans cannot absorb water through the skin so it is back to the shaved ice again sucking on popsicles or just taking tiny sips through a juice box straw. hopefully his doctor gave him something for pain. a little tylenol with codeine eliier will help him a great deal but you will need to get someone to call in a prescription for him. if his throat hurts less he will be more likely to drink. signs of dehydration include a lack of tears a dry mouth and a reduction in his urine output.
"not hormonal but it could be just a psychological desire to have a family of your own. i agree that having a baby at 18 is premature especially if you have not completed your education. you will have plenty of time for a family later. after you have the ""infrastructure"" like a good supportive husband who is working - a stable relationshio a home to raise the baby and a career that is compatible to spending quality time with a baby. even little girls want babies. this is why they play with dolls so your feelings are normal. a wise young woman will have the wisdom to wait."

its a hormone a synthetically produced hormone. most melatonin is not harvested from pineal glands. our body produces melatonin and most people dont realize this but we all already have enough melatonin in our systems. taking extra melatonin probably isnt going to do a whole heck of a lot unless youre melatonin deficient or unless youre taking it right at the right time in the cycle to help produce sleep. what is the best time to take melatonin? well thats a more complicated question than most people would imagine. so for example melatonin is only truly effective when you take it at particular times of the day and that timing has to be exactly opposite of your core body temperature drop. and so what ends up happening is you may end up you dont take melatonin like you would a sleeping pill where you take a sleeping pill and then get in the bed and fall asleep. melatonin doesnt really work that way. youd probably be taking it 2 â 3 hours ahead of the time youre about ready to go to bed and that should hit your cycle. everybodys cycle is different and so its kind of hard to tell. if youve already started to go down in terms of your core body temperature cycle and you take melatonin itll be completely ineffective which is why half of my patients tell me i tried melatonin and it didnt work and half my patients said i tried melatonin and it works great.
in general dental implants are not covered by dental insurance at this time. coverage under your medical plan may be possible depending on the insurance plan and/or cause of tooth loss. detailed questions about your individual needs and how they relate to insurance should be discussed with your dentist and your insurance provider.
most experts define infertility as not being able to get pregnant after at least one year of trying. women who are able to get pregnant but then have repeat miscarriages are also said to be infertile. pregnancy is the result of a complex chain of events. in order to get pregnant: a woman must release an egg from one of her ovaries (ovulation). the egg must go through a fallopian tube toward the uterus (womb). a man's sperm must join with (fertilize) the egg along the way. the fertilized egg must attach to the inside of the uterus (implantation). infertility can result from problems that interfere with any of these steps.
i seriously doubt you will find any doctor willing to do this for you especially steroids (anabolic steroids? ) that you have been able to purchase somewhere else. i don't think there is really any safe steroid regime that would be recommended for a teenager. i would advise you to really look in to the serious side-effects before considering using them.
this early a pregnant woman may not have sufficient hcg to be detected on those tests so repeat them the blood test in a few weeks. so yes you can be pregnant. if you are having sex not using birth control and you and your partner is not sterile it is only a matter of time before a pregnancy will happen. yes! i had negative blood and urine test but i felt pregnant this was my third pregnancy so i knew a thing or two. i did not have a missed period but i just knew. when friday came i was three days my period i said ok if this is negative then im not and my mind is playing tricks on me. everything was negative both blood and urine. fine went out bought a box of pads my period would be here monday and i was over it. monday came and no period bought a pregnancy test just to make sure and there were those double lines. called my dr. she ordered blood work my hcg levels were crazy high and she had no words. so a woman knows hopfully this helped. no you can not be pregnant. blood test are very accurate and if it came out negative then you are not pregnant.

celery green peppers thyme  and chamomile tea  all contain a phytochemical that research suggests has strong anti-inflammatory action. plant components (phytochemicals) appear to have the ability to protect us from harmful inflammation which can increase the risk of cancer heart disease and insulin resistance. additional clues about how plant compounds help prevent cancer and other disease have been revealed thanks to a series of studies from the western human nutrition research center in davis calif. the researchers are careful to point out that several key questions still need to be answered such as: are the compounds as effective in humans as they are in lab-cultured cells? what amounts of the phytochemicals do our bodies actually absorb and use from the foods we eat? the six plant compounds that the researchers specifically investigated (because they are thought to act as anti-inflammatory agents) are luteolin quercetin chrysin eriodicytol hesperetin and naringenin. here are a couple of the phytochemical discoveries:  the six phytochemicals studied were shown to inhibit a particular enzymes ability to activate a biochemical signal that leads to inflammation.  luteolin was the most effective inhibitor of the pro-inflammatory enzyme. luteolin can be found in celery thyme green peppers and chamomile tea. foods rich in quercetin include capers apples and onions. oranges grapefruit lemons and other citrus fruits are good sources of hesperetin eriodicytol and naringenin. consider this another good reason to add more fruits and vegetables to your everyday diet.
absolutely not. there has never been a scientific association made between ovarian cancer and the use of perfumed talcum powder (baby powder).
only time will provide that important answer for you. tinnitus can be caused by many things and you are only assuming it was due solely to the ibuprofen.
allergy shots a form of treatment known as immunotherapy involve injecting small quantities of substances to which the patient is allergic. the shots are given regularly for a long time with the aim of desensitizing the patient or getting the patient to tolerate the allergen without developing symptoms. this type of therapy is effective in controlling symptoms of allergies related to hay fever indoor allergens and insect stings. researchers however have not yet proven that these shots can prevent any allergic reactions to food.
these drugs can help u aspirin drugs that treat epilepsy such as divalproex sodium (depakote) or topiramate (topamax) tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline (elavil) or nortriptyline (pamelor) blood pressure medicines called beta blocker
stds? no. there's a reason why they are called sexually transmitted diseases you don't generally pick them up off of surfaces. hepatitis is a remote possibility but the odds are really against it. if this is a concern to you there are some simple things to keep yourself safe. wash your hands after you go to the bathroom and before you eat. try not to touch your eyes mouth and pimples without washing your hands first. cover your cuts. besides a cut would have to be open and bleeding to be much of an entrance to your body. skin and scabs make a pretty good barrier to disease. and many viruses die quickly. so. hand washing cover your cuts don't touch your eyes nose and mouth very much. simple as that!
red hot ears are interesting phenomena that many people experience. for some unknown reason warm oxygen-rich blood is being shunted to your outer ears. this is a variation of simple blushing. sometimes people can even experience pain when this happensnot just embarrassment. if your problem is severe there are only a few medical options to treat it. some ents use beta-blockers (drugs that are traditionally used to treat high blood pressure and other cardiac problems). sometimes beta-blockers will helpsometimes they dont.
hi. thanks for the query. it looks to be due to bells palsy only. however only some branches of the facial nerve seems affected leading to reduced function of confined portion of the face. consult a neurologist and get evaluated. physiotherapy vitamin b6 and b 12 supplements and steroid can be advised.
most helpful answer a few facts: tetanus is rare but if you got it it is nearly 100% fatal. tetanus is usually not caused by surface wounds but deeper tissue wounds. tetanus vaccine is 100% protective for 10 years  a small price to pay for this type of insurance. i am pleased that you cleaned the wound carefully since tetanus shots do not prevent wound infections. although i cannot see if your finger needed stitches or not if it is over 8 hours it cannot be sutured. it will need to heal from the inside out. you need to use an antibacterial ointment or cream and observe for signs of infection (redness pus increased tenderness swelling) and see your medical provider if this happens. i vote for the tetanus shot. if it doesn't help you for this wound it least it will help you over the next ten years. your pharmacist may be able to give it to you if this service is provided there. if you decide not to get it that would need to be your decision.
hi. instead of injections and surgery you can go for physiotherapy traction swd infra red or laser treatment. these have no harmful side effects and will benefit your spine as you are very young now. back muscle stenghthening exercises and using support belts will help as well. thanks
if the injection was given improperly it is very possible to involve nerves in this area. since it has been a month you should be examined by your medical provider or the place where you received the injection.
with prostate surgeries the chances of erectile dysfunctions are high due to the nerves passing nearby and get injured during surgery. treatment is mostly supportive and sex therapy helps. i hope it helps. stay in touch with your healthcare provider for further guidance as our answers are just for education and counselling purposes and cannot be an alternative to actual visit to a doctor. take care khan
no. it is not high. this is a normal temperature. there are many different reasons for a fussy baby so it is always best to check with her pediatrician. many babies at this age will start to get colic symptoms (gassy spitting up fussy and crying in the evening etc. )
weve had a good run with filling injections such as juvederm restylane perline artefill radiesse and recently sculptra which actually rather than offering immediate filling encourages the tissues under the skin surface to thicken and tighten. new collagen is formed. we have a large pool of experience with female patients. the ladies are happy with the results. of course people would like to have longer-lasting products with less risk and science continues to stay up all night in the laboratory working on that. botox and dysport have proven their value not only in the area of the horizontal forehead lines but the frown lines between the eyebrows and crows feet around the eyes. also a very hyperactive chin muscle that seems to quiver with every facial movement can be controlled with these medications which essentially lightly paralyze the nerves. how are men doing with it? well certainly there are fewer men who seek the services than women. one of the things weve learned is that particularly with botox and dysport it takes a larger dose to paralyze the muscle because mens muscles are thicker. another issue that must be dealt with is that bruising must be avoided since men do not have the option of applying makeup as women do. however when the techniques are done well there is very little chance of bruising. we always favor immediate application of ice as well as encourage patients to stop taking any medication such as aspirin so that there will be less chance of bruising. we are also currently investigating using arnica as a preventative just as we use it in face and neck lifting blepharoplasty and brow surgery.
your age may be one of the more important determinants in whether hpv testing is recommended. among younger women infections with hpv are very common. often a younger womans immune system is able to fight off an hpv infection. thus some type of pap smear may be the best choice for screening. by contrast if a women in her 30s or older has a positive test for high risk hpv it might be assumed that she has a more worrisome persisting infection. 90% of cervical cancers occur in unscreened or under-screened women (demay 2000). so you do need to get screenings but the type and interval of screening is going to depend upon your age and probably high risk hpv screening tests. liquid based paps do reduce the number of false negative results in the majority of women. ask your gyn if your pap will be a liquid type and if it will be reviewed by automated and human screeners. if you have one of the high risk hpv subtypes by dna testing request a copy of the results for your files so you will know which subtype you have. even if you have received a hpv vaccination you should will still need a pap smear. the recommended interval is still under discussion.
can you? yes. should you? probably not but that would be up to your child's pediatrician. there have been some studies that have shown a worsening of symptoms when vicks is used. it is not very effective in controlling any of these cold symptoms so you really don't need to subject your baby to this either rubbed on there chests (some grandmas even feel that putting on the feet will help! ) or in a hot vaporizer. i know that many of us were raised by a parent that used vicks and we survived but that does not mean it is 100% safe in infants. in my pediatric practice i discourage the use of vicks on a baby this young and ignore the dirty looks that i get from the grandmas when i inform them. for adults and older kids they can use it if they want.

with careful planning a vegan diet can meet the needs of your child. but you do have to be more vigilant about key nutrients such as iron zinc calcium vitamin d vitamin b12 and dha. because iron and zinc are not absorbed as well in plant foods include higher-than-recommended amounts. adding vitamin-c rich sources (strawberries tomatoes/tomato based products oranges kiwi and broccoli) to help absorb iron from fortified foods and plant sources. vegan children need a supplemental source of b12 (either fortified foods or supplements) because it only occurs naturally in animal foods. here are vegan foods sources for key nutrients that are important to stay on top of: vitamin b12: fortified nutritional yeast fortified cereals fortified soymilk meat analogues and supplements. iron: iron-fortified cereal beans tofu spinach raisins and enriched bread. zinc: cashews chickpeas oatmeal almonds beans and peas (be careful with nuts which are choking hazards) vitamin d: fortified foods (like soy milk) and supplements. the american academy of pediatrics recommends supplementation for children who don't get enough from diet. the recommended amount is 600iu. omega-3 dha: not naturally found in plant foods but can be found in some fortified foods and supplements. calcium: tofu made with calcium sulfate fortified soy milk/yogurt turnip greens kale fortified cereals a vegan diet is perfectly healthy for your son. you can get a complete diet based on the food pyramid if you are a vegan. here is how: grains - all natural forms of these products are vegan. if you buy processed foods you will need to check all the labels as some often contain animal products. be careful as some products use terminology that does not make it explicit that they are animal products. i recommend that you check an official vegan website for some of this terminology like sheffafoods veganfoods and many more you can do some online searches to find the relevant information. dairy: if you are a lacto vegan you can eat most dairy products. milk is not an animal so you might be okay with this. you will need b12 supplement if you are pure vegan; it is supplied in soy milk. drink it daily if you are pure vegan. if you ask me animal protein can't be replaced by anything else! so i would say that a vegan diet would not be a good idea especially for a 3-year child!
krill oil a rich source of omega 3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (dha) and eicosapentaenoic acid (epa) plays a key role in a healthy diet. according to the american cancer society there is some research that fish oils with these omega 3 fatty acids such as krill oil decrease the rate of cancer cell growth but not all studies agree. the most evidence for the benefits of fish oil is improving heart health including risk factors such as high triglycerides. always check with your healthcare provider about taking supplements during cancer treatment. for more on the benefits of krill oil see this webmd article 
angioedema is a swelling similar to urticaria (hives) but the swelling occurs beneath the skin instead of on the surface. angioedema is characterized by deep swelling around the eyes and lips and sometimes of the hands and feet.
hi two things you always see your doctor for is blood in stools and blood in urine so doctor go asap good luck
it depends on what your skin type is how sensitive your skin is and how much sun exposure you are going to have. i love foundations that have sunscreens built into them. i think it's great to add sunscreen into any product you can to get that extra added protection. however i think it is important to use some protection underneath them. i don't think they give enough protection because to have that true spf 15 you would have to use enough product and typically that would be too thick a foundation to really give you enough protection. so i would use a moisturizer with sunscreen underneath and then a foundation with sunscreen in it right over it.
your estimated fertility window would have been between 5/31 and 6/10. this is based on a 28 day cycle so if your cycle is not 28 days your fertility window would be a little different.
she would have to speak with her ob/gyn to find out what she can take while pregnant. while some over-the-counter medications are considered safe in pregnancy different doctors have different rules on what they allow their patients to take.
about 75% of people have no symptoms when they first acquire hepatitis c infection. the remaining 25% may complain of fatigue loss of appetite muscle aches or fever. yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice) is rare at this early stage of infection. over time the liver in people with chronic infection may begin to experience the effects of the persistent inflammation caused by the immune reaction to the virus. blood tests may show elevated levels of liver enzymes a sign of liver damage which is often the first suggestion that the infection may be present. patients may become easily fatigued or complain of nonspecific symptoms. as cirrhosis develops symptoms increase and may include : weakness. loss of appetite. weight loss. breast enlargement in men. a rash on the palms. difficulty with the clotting of blood. spider-like blood vessels on the skin. in patients with advanced cirrhosis the liver begins to fail. this is a life-threatening problem. confusion and even coma (encephalopathy) may result from the inability of the liver to process certain toxic substances. increased pressure in the blood vessels of the liver (portal hypertension) may cause fluid to build up in the abdominal cavity (ascites) and result in engorged veins in the swallowing tube (esophageal varices) that tear easily and can bleed suddenly and massively. portal hypertension also can cause kidney failure or an enlarged spleen resulting in a decrease of blood cells and the development of anemia increased risk of infection and bleeding. in advanced cirrhosis liver failure causes decreased production of clotting factors. patients with advanced cirrhosis often develop jaundice because the damaged liver is unable to eliminate a yellow compound called bilirubin that is formed from the hemoglobin of old red blood cells.
there is really nothing non-surgical that can permanent fix asymmetrical breast sizes. sure you can use padding on the smaller side to fill the gap in the bra but that does not alter your self-image when that bra is removed. just about every female patient that i have had over the years who underwent a breast surgery for enlargement making them firmer after a few kids or even having a breast reduction are happy. prices vary on this cosmetic procedure but so do prices on used cars! you can spend $5000 (a guess since the price varies) on a boob-job or $5000 a used car. the breast job does not require gasoline insurance or much maintenance; and will last a lifetime. the car? it will eventually fall apart. you can get a car loan to buy it. you can get a boob loan to pay for surgery if this is important to you. you will likely be glad that you did and your husband. i don't think he will be complaining very much. i know that money can be tight but making a modest monthly payment to pay off your new breasts is really something i think most families can financially manage with a bit of planning. you had two children. your deserve it. many cosmetic surgeons have free consultations. make a few appointments and take your husband with you.
whether you are pregnant or not sunning has risks. when you are pregnant dehydration may occur which can lead to preterm delivery and if severe early in pregnancy may lead to possible pregnancy loss. sunburns increase the risk of skin cancer; you need to be careful. i recommend all women to be very careful when at the beach. i really don't recommend being out in the heat of the day. you must drink plenty of liquids in order to stay hydrated. you should not be under the direct sunlight either. stay covered when outside. if you have further questions i would suggest you contact your physician.
if you have taken the urine pregnancy test after seven days of missed periods then the results are usually conclusive. you may repeat the test after 48 hours and if it is still negative then you are not pregnant. the delay can possibly be due to stress induced hormonal imbalance especially during this cycle due to stressors which can easily delay your menses. if your menses do not arrive naturally in next one week then you may opt for a withdrawal bleed with progesterone. a single delayed period is not an indication for infertility workup. repeat the tests and consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online  
i would recommend you take a look at your new options through your state's health insurance marketplace. you don't say whether your child on ssdi is currently covered by medicare. if so that would stay in place. the law allows you to keep adult children on your health plan up until age 26 so you could shop for a health plan through the new marketplace for you and your children. your kids could also look into a student health plan through their universities. many offer one. if your child living out of state does not have access to a school-based health plan he/she may be better served by shopping for a plan on the marketplace in the state where he or she lives rather than sticking with you. that's because you'll pay much less for care you receive from in-network providers and if out of state your son or daughter won't be able to access doctors on your plan.
fatty liver is an early stage of cirrhosis. both the conditions indicate different steps of the same pathological disease. from the symptoms it does seem to be cirrhosis and you should get medical attention at the earliest

thank you for reaching out with this question. it's an important one for others your age who have your symptoms. my advice? check with your doctor before doing any exercise at all even walking for exercise. he or she can give you specific instructions for what type of exercise(s) to do for how long and at what intensity. if you decide to walk anyway (hey i know how you 86 year olds are! ) please have someone with you at all times. because of your weakness i have a real concern about your falling and breaking a hip. right now you may need to focus more on diet than on exercising especially since you say you feel extremely weak. i salute you for being a survivor and wish you many more healthful years! you inspire me.
i have plenty of ideas but i do not know you your medical history or have any way of doing a thorough examination and diagnostic work-up. something that you need. you will need to see a medical professional. ideas are not diagnoses and there can be hundreds if not thousands of diagnostic possibilities that could account for your array of symptoms.
hi could be best you just wait to see if you next period is a no show then you will know for sure. but a discharge a week after ovulation but women always have a discharge its how your vagina works and as it goes through your cycle and it changes thin to thick and a colour change from white to yellowish and back. so if your next period is a no show just wait a week and see your doctor and get tested there. hope this helps you. good luck
treatment with antiviral drugs can help people who are bothered by genital herpes outbreaks stay symptom-free longer. these drugs can also reduce the severity and duration of symptoms when they flare up. drug therapy is not a cure but it can make living with the condition easier. there are three major drugs commonly used to treat genital herpes symptoms: acyclovir (zovirax) famciclovir (famvir) and valacyclovir (valtrex). these are all taken in pill form. severe cases may be treated with intravenous (iv) acyclovir. formulas applied to the surface of the skin provide little benefit and doctors don't usually recommend them.

the smaller your airway is to begin with the smaller it will be when it is swollen from a viral croup infection. your airway gets larger as you age. kids under age three are the most affected. and adults (yes like you) are the least affected. so a baby might have trouble catching his breath with croup and an adult might just have a hoarse voice (or laryngitis). can adults get croup from kids this is the question i've heared quite much and when you search on google you can find that its. so do you know what is croup croup speard through by which way and can adults get croup from kids? read more: 
1st thing you need to do is avoid taking ibuprofen benadryl or any other nsaids. this may trigger you angioedema more. take anti allergic medicines to reduce the itching and swelling rapidly. low dose steroids can help. but these should not be taken for more than 5-7 days. consult a doctor if the swelling doesnt subside. get kidney function tests done

"she needs to be taken back her pediatrition. when you mentioned the sinus infection you said a ""possible"" sinus infection. i am assuming it was not established 100% that she did in fact have one and if she has taken two rounds of antibiotics and both were different antibiotics i would take her bak and insist they ck for flu rsv bronchitis etc. my 4 yr old grandaughter had the same thing and when the admitting dr from the er called her regular dr to let them know he was doing an admission the first thing the pediatrician asked was if the grandmother was there meaning me. i am a nurse and they were just blowing my daughter off thinking she was overreacting due to being a first time mom. it takes abou 5 minutes to do a simple test for rsv about 10 to ck for the flu and they did none of that and she had to stay in the hospital about 10 days because they didn't bother to run the proper tests."

in absence of major symptoms like fever loss of weight appetite bloody stools etc your symptoms could be due to irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a chronic functional disorder characterized by cramping abdominal pain or discomfort with alterations in bowel habits (bloating constipation and diarrhea). these symptoms usually are present for at least 12 weeks in a patient during the previous one year and unfortunately the onset or subsidence cannot be predicted. most symptoms of ibs can be controlled with diet stress management and prescribed medications. it requires a proper examination and investigations results to give a precise diagnosis. kindly visit a physician for counselling and treatment. take care!
men need skin care regimens too. they should cleanse morning and night ideally with a foaming face wash. men should also use sunscreen every day all year round and exfoliate weekly.
there can be many reasons to have a light menstrual period or spotting while on the pill. it does not necessarily mean you are pregnant. birth control pills taken properly of course are highly effective so your chance of an unintended pregnancy is not very high. can it happen? yes so if you are having any other signs of pregnancy a home pregnancy test or a visit to your gynecologist would be in something to consider.
there is a possibility that there may have been multiple attempts at the same site before taking the blood sample. this causes extravasation of blood in the surrounding tissues as well leading to hematoma formation often accompanied with discoloration of skin. this may also cause increase in compartment pressure (caused when pressure builds up within the muscle) cause pain especially while stretching. you may use hot fomentation locally over the site for 15 minutes each thrice a day. definitely you will be benefitted from this. for further doubts consult a family physician online  
genital herpes is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases ( stds ). the disease can be bothersome. but if you are a healthy adult you do not need to worry that it will cause serious problems. most people never have symptoms or the symptoms are so mild that people do not know that they are infected. but in some people the disease causes occasional outbreaks of itchy and painful sores in the genital area. after the first outbreak the herpes virus stays in the nerve cells below the skin and becomes inactive. it usually becomes active again from time to time traveling back up to the skin and causing more sores. things like stress illness a new sex partner or menstruation may trigger a new outbreak. as time goes on the outbreaks happen less often heal faster and don't hurt as much. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

i'm sorry to hear this. many people think a keloid is just a large unattractive scar. they don't realize the pain a keloid can cause. i'd suggest you consult a plastic and reconstructive surgeon. he or she will be able to assess your keloid and provide you with various treatment options from cortisone injections to surgery. of course surgical removal of a keloid can lead to. another keloid. however i've seen good results from the surgical removal of keloids too. at any rate a plastic and reconstructive surgeon will be able to give you all of your options up to an including surgery. you certainly can opt for less aggressive treatment first to see if it will work. i wish you all the best!

i seriously doubt that the virus is still active after all of these years. most people clear hpv [human papillomavirus] within 12-24 months after acquisition especially the kind of wart virus that can be seen as a wart vs. the kind that can cause cervical cancer.
i'm so sorry for your loss. even if it wasn't your child that's a very sad situation. it's really tough to know what all could have been wrong - even if they hadn't died by choking they could have gotten fluid in their lungs (aspiration) and that could have indeed caused death. i would want to know what they got into. if they cried when they walked or stood and had the other issues you were talking about there could have been some kind of profound birth defect that might have meant they weren't going to survive long anyway. could that be why the autopsy is taking so long? could they perhaps be trying to figure out what the problem was? unfortunately even autopsies don't always reveal what the issue was if it was neurological for example. i would want to know why they called it strangulation too. if the child was found clutching at their throat for example they might suspect choking on an object - but the child might have done that if they had been having trouble breathing too. keep in mind that 'strangulation' can have different meanings. it can mean they were strangled by someone or that they choked and strangled on something or it can mean that there was internal strangulation like with a hernia and a loop of bowel. you need better definitions before you will have an answer. once again you have my sympathy and i hope you can find some definitive answers.
have you ever stood before the meat department and wondered what to do? eye of round london broil new york flank filet mignon  they all stand before you and it can be overwhelming. my cousin celia called me today. she was having that what to do with the meat?  dilemma. she was getting ready for a friends birthday party (this friend loves a great steak) but wasnt sure which cut to pick for the crowd. if youre having a group of people and plan to serve filet mignon it can be a costly endeavor. my favorite cut of meat when entertaining and working on a budget is london broil. it is not a fatty cut. the thing you need to be careful about is cutting it correctly so its not chewy. when you are starting make sure to wait until the meat is room temperature â do not start cooking it right out of the refrigerator. if your meat is too cold when you start cooking it it will end up being dried out and chewy. i recommend using an oven or grill on high heat and dont cook the steak too long (i recommend medium rare to medium at the most). you can vary your presentation and flavors greatly. i also recommend that after you cook a piece of meat that is 1-2 pounds slice it thin. this way you end up eating a smaller portion of meat. you still get your boost of protein and iron â and not by overdoing it on a 20-ounce ribeye! you can rub a london broil piece down with cracked pepper kosher salt and extra virgin olive oil. throw it on the grill and then finish it with chopped fresh rosemary and some sautÃ©ed garlic. you can also serve the sliced beef on a bed of arugula and heirloom tomatoes that are drizzled with a bit of extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar. anyway you prepare it have fun with it and remember to keep your portion size in mind. a good visual for portion size is the size of your fist.
let me start by saying that smokeless tobacco is no less dangerous in terms of causing cancer than cigarettes. i hope your husband realizes this. even if the stomach problems and diarrhea are new symptoms they could indeed be caused by smokeless tobacco usage. people who use smokeless tobacco and spit still swallow some of the saliva that contains harmful substances. that's why some of the cancers that arise from smokeless tobacco use can include cancers of the stomach pancreas and colon. of course smokeless tobacco use also can cause many types of oral cancers. if your husband's symptoms don't clear up on their own or if they're accompanied by fever pain or shortness of breath then he definitely should have them checked out by a medical professional. you can start with your primary health care provider. best wishes to you and your husband!
masturbation is a choice. it is definitely not necessary. eating is necessary. drinking is necessary. paying taxes is necessary. masturbation is optional. masturbation is not a necessity and if a person does not want to engage in the practice there is no reason that he should; however if he opts not to masturbate and it is not due to reasons such as religious beliefs being too busy enjoys exerting willpower etc. he may want to consider consulting with a doctor in case he has a low libido and might want to take steps to address that issue. on a separate note all men should keep an eye on their penis health; using a top notch penis health cream (health professionals recommend man1 man oil) can help. a good bet is a cream that includes l-arginine which can help with penis blood flow issues. hi o the joys of a j arthur one of the wrist spank the monkey bash the bishop yes these all mean to masturbate with the pleasure of ones own penis. its something we don't did to do but if your feeling horny and your wife g/f are not around then being men we just did it don't put it off don't try and hold back from it its not dirty and don't be ashamed but it will make you fell relaxed. its something you can do in the shower the bath in the car(but not why your driving or why taken a walk in the country. as men do we need it your read at some point that some men can go through there whole life and say never done that! but doing it is good for our prostate keeps our system ticking over till we do need it so yes in one way we do need to masturbate why our body's need it so for that just once or twice a week will not hurt you. but don't forget don't use a tight grip it needs to be feather light just like the feel of the vagina and use some oil just baby oil will do or some olive oil if your in the kitchen shower gel when in the shower gives that extra clean same in the bath or just a bar of soap it all helps. do hope this helps. good luck

since there is generally no heat involved in the pickling process it doesnt significantly change the nutritional value of foods. this is particularly true if you start with raw veggies and keep the skin on since the skin often carries much of the nutritional value including the fiber. the fermentation process involved in pickling may even produce some health benefits since the healthy bacteria (probiotics) involved in the process can help keep your digestive system healthy. one possible nutritional downfall of pickling is the addition of salt which is key to the process. for that reason pickled beets and other vegetables are a good option to enjoy from time to time. but you dont want to make them your go-to sources of veggies.

it sounds like a sinus infection to me based on the symptoms you describe. you may be able to clear things out by using some over the counter decongestant nasal spray taking a lot of hot steamy showers and eating foods with lots of garlic in it. basically the infection should get better on its own if you can clear out your sinuses. however if your symptoms don't get better see a doctor.

actually it has been found that substance abuse is a way for a person with bipolar disorder to self medicate themselves as a way of coping with this disorder. most of the rest of what the other person's answer is pretty accurate. however the migraine's thyroid issues and such are all side effects from the medications that are used to treat bipolar disorder another side effect is called tardive dyskinesia which causes the person to have uncontrollable muscle spasms and there is no cure as of yet for this horrible side effect. i have ba in psychology and also have bipolar disorder and am a recovered drug addict.
an allergy to your own urine is not possible. your labial itching may eventually help you overcome your fear of being examined since this may be the only way you can have this problem properly diagnosed. this is not something that can be done blindly over the internet based solely on a vague description. having a sympathetic female physician pa or nurse practitioner should ease your discomfort and fear especially if you disclose it prior to your visit. have a trusted friend go with you. your doctor can even provide you with a short-acting anti-anxiety medication to help you overcome your fear. in most cases a yeast infection is the underlying cause but since the labia is covered in skin and skin can have hundreds of dermatological conditions that cause itching it would likely be futile to try and treat a condition that is not even diagnosed.
no. thc will show up as thc but not ibuprofen.
theres no benefit to receiving the flu shot a second time if you received the flu shot in september. a vaccine received in the fall should protect you through the flu season. the flu shot for the northern hemisphere is formulated once a year and there have not been any updates to the influenza vaccine for the 2012-2013 season since the last time you received it.
i think this is a great question. one of the things we learned after hurricane katrina is that a lot of people didn't have emergency kits available at home. some things i would definitely recommend include a bottle of hydrogen peroxide; to help clean out any type of wounds. maybe a triple antibiotic ointment to apply on the wounds after you have actually treated it band aids gauze pads rolled gauze so you can keep the gauze pad in place a flashlight extra batteries a weather radio. some type of fever reducer like tylenol or acetaminophen. maybe a motrin type of product as well. some imodium or pepto-bismol is another item that you may want to include in there along with some plastic latex gloves just in case something happens and you need to protect yourself. those are some of the common items that are found in the emergency kits that are available on the stores today. i would definitely recommend checking the expiration dates. once a year you should always go through that emergency kit as well as your medicine cabinet and check the expiration dates; if anything has expired you want to make sure that you dispose of it properly. in this case we want to make sure that people use the correct method. you want to get a ziploc bag and you want to take the medications and put it into the ziploc bag. you want to take a little bit of water and you want to help it dissolve or you can crush it with like a pot or a hammer. then you want to take something that will make it not very appealing like kitty litter or coffee grinds. put that into the ziploc bag seal it up and put it in the trash. that's the best way. we don't want people to flush medications anymore this is the preferred way now to dispose of medications. but that's a good rule of thumb each year to do.

hello how often do you have these migraines and how severe are they? if your migraines are as severe as mine are have you seen a nero i have heard that they can help. my primary dr. had sent me to go see a nero. and they are starting botox injections i have heard that these do help especially with those of us that deal with a score of about 8 out of 10 severity and suffer pretty much each & every day of our life with migraines. i further see a pain management dr. but my primary dr. recommended for me to go see the nero! there are a lot of over the counter and prescription meds that can cause migraines this includes depression meds. depending on the dose and what kind you are on could be causing your migraines to be worse. i do know that when you suffer with migraines - depression follows this is normal. so the questions are have you had the migraines before you started the depression meds. have you had migraines all your life is their something that caused your migraines i. e an accident or anything else as their are a lot of factors that play with migraines including stress work kids home spouse and neck injuries. only you know and what started them and or how long ago they started could it have been due to an accident or is it due to any of the other factors listed above. if your not sure if you injured your neck i would start with your dr. requesting an mri of your head and neck just to rull out any neck problems. next try to rid your self of any and all stress if possible if all else fail then i believe that you should talk to your primary dr. and see if he/she can refer you to go see a nero to start getting the botox injections as these do take a while and with repeat injection to start working. for some people these injections start working right away and for others it takes several injections before they start working. it all depends on the individual pearson. just take it 1 step at a time i know how aggravating and painful migraines are as with mine comes extreme vomiting and i can not handel any light or sounds. best of luck to you

here is a good tutorial to help you limit potassium and protein in your diet. be sure to stay in touch with your doctor as your diet needs may change depending on your kidney function or various treatments (like starting dialysis). potassium is found in many fruits and vegetables including potatoes tomatoes oranges dark green leafy greens pumpkin and cantaloupe. focus on low potassium produce like apples carrots corn mushrooms blueberries and cucumbers. as for protein be sure to ask your doctor or dietitian how many grams you are allowed which is usually based on weight. one ounce of meat has about 7g of protein but you'll want to read labels on other food items. if you go on dialysis your protein needs will increase. good luck!

"there are several antibiotics that are not on your list. the selection of an appropriate antibiotic takes you allergies into consideration as well as the diagnosis and severity of the illness. we consider allergies to cover entire classes. for instance when are allergic to augmentin we assume you may be allergic to all penicillins in this class. when you are allergic to doxycycline you are considered allergic to the tetracycline class. there is not an antibiotic called ""clydomyacine"" so you may be referring to clindamycin(? ). it is best to keep an accurate list of your allergies. a few antibiotics that are not on your list would include sufla drugs and erythromycin / macrolide class drugs. another would be the fluoroquinalone class antibiotics. there are more."

one of the first pregnancy symptoms you may notice is that your period does not arrive. while this symptom is one we most commonly associate with pregnancy there may be other reasons why a period hasnt arrived for example high levels of stress major illness or surgery. another well known pregnancy symptom is morning sickness. morning sickness can pay you a visit any time of day so make sure you eat enough and avoid letting your blood sugar levels drop. ginger is a great natural remedy for nausea so its worth a try although some women find that nothing seems to help their morning sickness which normally hangs around for the first trimester before getting better or if you are unlucky the second trimester or even whole pregnancy. for more details click on early pregnancy symptoms

"i don't know what you mean by you ""don't have time for this. "" curing a vitamin d deficiency is as easy as taking a pill once a day. low vitamin d levels have been associated with bone pain general muscle weakness and even cancer (thought that's unlikely in a young person). it's doubtful your sleepiness and lack of concentration are due to vitamin d deficiency but i suppose anything's possible. you don't need any ""other test"" to determine the cause of your low vitamin d levels. it's pretty simple: you're not consuming enough vitamin d and you're not getting enough sunlight on your skin. this is a very common problem. on the one hand we medical professionals tell people to wear sunscreen. on the other hand we tell them they're deficient in vitamin d. the solution is to continue wearing sunscreen when you go in the sun for prolonged periods of time and to take vitamin d supplements. if you have no personal or family history of skin cancer you probably are safe to get 15-30 minutes of sun per day on your skin. this will help boost your vitamin d levels. given how very deficient you are in vitamin d i hope you took the prescribed 50 000 iu of vitamin d every other day until the prescription was gone. the usual length of therapy is a couple of weeks. you should get re-tested if you have not already done so. and then you may need to continue taking inexpensive vitamin d supplements for awhile until your levels are within normal range. please note you should not continue taking 50 000 iu of vitamin d indefinitely. that's a very large dose. if you have any questions consult your health care provider. wishing you well! i don't believe the answer is always so cut and dry. my vitmain d level has been low and getting lower for at least 5 years now. i don't tolerate the heat or sunshine so i don't get very much sun. but i have been pushing myself to tolerate it. but i've been on several very high courses of good quality vitamin d supplements and the mainstays of my diet are all vitamin d rich. but there was never even a slight rise in my levels. at last check my levels were in the single digits. incidentally i am always tired and always in pain these days. absolutely! i have had similar symptoms along with cardiac and autoimmune disorders. my vitamin d level is 13 and has runned low for years. i too never worried about vitamin d but i've found out that it's a huge problem and runs in my family related to synthesis problems of vitamins and enzymes. have levels check regularly even after normal labs and please take your vitamin d with lots of sunshine and diet rich in vitamin d c b12 calcium etc. i've gotten much better! they all work together. what i meant is i don't have time to feel so down with all my responsibilities i did start taking the pill recently. i was asking what other tests can i do to determine the cause of feeling sleepy all the time and having concentration issues and if it's somehow related to my vitamin d insufficiency. nonetheless thank you for putting time and answering. greatly appreciate all the answers."

"most helpful answer assuming your ""strep"" was lab confirmed and diagnosed i would not be too concerned with those white bumps right now. white bumps incidentally is not a definitive sign of strep. these can be seen with a variety of different viruses and can even be trapped food particles not pus. it would not be wise or recommended to change your dose of penicillin. penicillin is the drug of choice for strep so if you do have it then this will work. the fact that you are improving is a better sign. swimming in the pool is not relevant. swimming does not cause or contribute to any diseases (no matter what your grandmother told you)."
one of the questions i have for this patient is how long have they been taking gaviscon. gaviscon is an antacid and to be honest it should only be used for about two weeks. if you are using it longer than that then it's time to probably see your doctor or healthcare provider to have it looked at. common side effects of antacids of long-term use are constipation and diarrhea. they also bind to certain medications and vitamins so you want to make sure that you are spacing them. if you have any questions at all come to talk to the pharmacist. tell us what medications you are taking we will be able to tell you if it's going to interact or not. but once again if you are taking it for more than two weeks we really need you to go to your doctor and have it looked at.
the first and most important step would be for you to get your ears properly examined. if you do have a full or partial wax impaction (trapping water behind it) or if wax or other debris is touching your eardrum this can be seen on examination and corrected on the spot in most cases. however if the crackling is caused by fluid or pressure variations in your middle ear space (the area on the other side of your eardrum) then the treatment would be different and perhaps take longer to achieve relief. swimming in water that may not be cure can lead to otitis externa (swimmer's ear) but this condition tends to be painful. crackling would not be your only symptom. as you may know each time you swallow air goes up your eustachian tubes to help equalize pressure. this is a normal response that goes on hundred of times every day. if you have fluid in your middle ear space (it is supposed to be just air) this can create little bubbles and those bubbles can cause crackling sounds sometimes. again an ear examination should be able to determine if you have middle ear fluid. treatment of any fluid would depend on the amount of fluid and how long you have had this condition . treatment options are very individualized range from using nasal corticosteroid sprays to having tubes inserted by an ent.

the most common way to treat epilepsy is with medication. specific drugs are prescribed depending on the type of epilepsy or seizure a person has. when medication doesn't work surgery is another treatment option. in some cases a surgeon can remove the area of the brain producing seizures or can interrupt the nerve pathways that signal seizures. for children a very strict meal plan called the ketogenic diet may reduce seizures. if a patient doesn't respond to medication and surgery is not an option vagus nerve stimulation can help prevent seizures. it works through a battery implant in the chest that delivers small pulses of electrical energy into the brain via the vagus nerve in the neck. the downside: it doesn't work for everyone and it is not approved by the fda for kids younger than age 12.

hi this is from a webmd post. depoprovera one of the highest doses of synthetic progesterone that an infant could receive from a birth control method would be from the depoprovera shot. a large group of children (1207 of them) exposed to depo in utero were examined for problems with growth or attainment of puberty. the use of depo during pregnancy did not adversely impact long term growth or sexual development of children. ok good luck

sorry to hear you're going through this! it sounds awful. many conditions could cause those symptoms. one possibility is food poisoning. if you're not running a fever it's probably ok to wait things out to see if the symptoms get better. meanwhile try to sip water or at least take ice chips. the combination of vomiting and diarrhea can cause dehydration pretty quickly. if you're still sick in a day or two it probably would be wise to call your health care provider or go to an urgent care facility. hope this helps!
"in most patients the psoriasis precedes the arthritis by months to years. the arthritis frequently involves the knees ankles and joints in the feet. usually only a few joints are inflamed at a time. the inflamed joints become painful swollen hot and red. sometimes joint inflammation in the fingers or toes can cause swelling of the entire digit giving them the appearance of a ""sausage. "" joint stiffness is common and is typically worse early in the morning. less commonly psoriatic arthritis may involve many joints of the body in a symmetrical fashion mimicking the pattern seen in rheumatoid arthritis. psoriatic arthritis can also cause inflammation of the spine (spondylitis) and the sacrum causing pain and stiffness in the low back buttocks neck and upper back. in rare instances psoriatic arthritis involves the small joints at the ends of the fingers. a very destructive form of arthritis called ""mutilans"" can cause rapid damage to the joints. fortunately this form of arthritis is rare in patients with psoriatic arthritis. patients with psoriatic arthritis can also develop inflammation of the tendons (tendinitis) and around cartilage. inflammation of the tendon behind the heel causes achilles tendinitis leading to pain with walking and climbing stairs. inflammation of the chest wall and of the cartilage that links the ribs to the breastbone (sternum) can cause chest pain as seen in costochondritis. aside from arthritis and spondylitis psoriatic arthritis can cause inflammation in other organs such as the eyes lungs and aorta. inflammation in the colored portion of the eye (iris) causes iritis a painful condition that can be aggravated by bright light as the iris opens and closes the opening of the pupil. corticosteroids injected directly into the eyes are sometimes necessary to decrease inflammation and prevent blindness. inflammation in and around the lungs (pleuritis) causes chest pain especially with deep breathing as well as shortness of breath. inflammation of the aorta (aortitis) can cause leakage of the aortic valve valves leading to heart failure and shortness of breath. acne and nail changes are commonly seen in psoriatic arthritis. pitting and ridges are seen in fingernails and toenails of 80% of patients with psoriatic arthritis. interestingly these characteristic nail changes are observed in only a minority of psoriasis patients who do not have arthritis. acne has been noted to occur in higher frequency in patients with psoriatic arthritis. in fact a new syndrome has been described characterized by inflammation of the joint lining (synovitis) acne and pustules on the feet or palms thickened and inflamed bone (hyperostosis) and bone inflammation (osteitis). this syndrome is therefore given the eponym sapho syndrome."
i understand that your living arrangements are not optimum but personally i would not want to sleep in a room with a kitty litter box. cats and their feces can carry a lot of bacteria to your new baby. because they are very curious they will be walking and contaminating surfaces used by the baby and even jumping in the crib. i know you love your cats but you have a bigger commitment to your newborn. perhaps you can find a temporary home for your cats until your apartment is ready or ask you dad to bend his litter box rule a bit until you move. cats and babies can co-exist but both will require very careful supervision and babies do come first. thank you for your advice but you didn't really answer my question as to if it poses a health risk to have them together?
yes this would be called viral conjunctivitis. however when it is only affecting one eye with purulent discharge i would be suspicious of a secondary bacterial component. this is just a guess however since i have no way of seeing your eye first-hand. many times it is difficult to tell even during an examination so many medical providers will just treat it with topical ophthalmic antibiotic ointments or drops. it may clear up on its own. it may spread to the other eye or to others in your family or work so having a prescription eye medication would nice. many medical offices will simply call it in for you if you ask. yes common cold can lead to eye infection and discharge. the infection can spread to your eyes leading to conjunctivitis. this may subside on its own once the common cold subsides.

all women can make their own decision on when or even whether they have a pelvic examination and a pap smear  these are two very different procedures. a pelvic exam is more than just a visual inspection of the cervix and external genitalia there is a bimanual componet to feel for masses benign tumors cancers ovarian abnormalities enlarged uterus etc. the pap smear is primarily for cancer or precancerous lesions. there are no good substitutes for either one. they are not just for women at risk. periodic pelvics and pap smears are for all women. they don't have to be annual anymore. if you have a series of negative paps and do not have an genetic familial or medical risk factors they can be less often. discuss this with your gynecologist.
"if your little grandson is on the chubby side the penis can be hidden by a surrounding fat pad quite common in children. if you push on the fatty area around his penis and the penis seems to emerge like turtle coming out of a shell then it is probably just fine. there is a medical condition called a ""hidden penis"" and another relatively-rare condition called a ""micropenis"" that you read about on an internet search but it may be too early to know if he has any of these unlikely conditions. bringing it up to the pediatrician at his upcoming one-year examination would be appropriate."

have you done anything to recolonized your intestines with good bacteria after killing all the old ones off? i'd try some greek yogurt also kefir sauerkraut and other probiotic foods. commercial probiotics help too but make sure you pick one with a wide range of helpful bacteria. also make sure you are drinking enough water. dark urine could mean kidney problems simple dehydration or malabsorption of nutrients from improper digestion of your food. if that doesn't help within a week or if you already have tried probiotic therapy this needs help from a doctor.

"because there are different types of ""ablation surgery "" it's not possible to accurately answer your question but here is some general information. your surgeon's office or the hospital should give you some written instructions about what medications you may and may not take prior to your procedure. if you did not receive any pre-operative teaching you should call your surgeon's office and ask when you will receive this information. if your procedure is scheduled for tomorrow then i would advise not taking any advil (ibuprofen) within 24 hours of your surgery. in general you should avoid taking any non-prescription medication before surgery. again you should receive written instructions before any type of surgical procedure. each surgery and surgeon have different restrictions on what medications you may take when you need to stop eating and drinking and other pre-operative procedures. best wishes on your procedure. i hope it goes well!"
most adults who acquire hbv during adulthood are able to eradicate the virus from their bodies. however you will always be positive for the hepatitis b core antibody - hbcab. your doctor needs to check for numerous other blood tests known as the hbv serology tests which include the hepatitis b antigens and hbvdna which will determine your level of infectiousness to others. combined with other tests such as lfts - will determine your need to start antiviral medication. if needles are not shared then there is no risk of transmission but it is never recommended to reuse needles even your own. there are many needle exchange programs available so that the need to reuse needles should not be necessary.

stretch marks occur from disruption in the underlying dermal support of the skin. topical medications that contain tretinoin are designed to increase cell turnover and encourage new collagen deposition. lasers work by targeting and subsequently tightening the dermis and encouraging new cell growth. a combination of topical products and lasers may improve less severe stretch marks. but more severe stretch marks are less likely to respond to nonsurgical approaches. stretch marks are weaknesses in the supporting structure of the skin causing layers of the skin (dermis) to separate and leaving the skin grooved and discolored. stretch marks develop when the skin is excessively stretched during pregnancy weight gain or growth spurts. they are most common during pregnancy and the teen years when growth spurts and increased levels of steroid hormones cause significant changes throughout the body. stretch marks can also be brought on by obesity. genetic factors including inherited defects of connective tissues also play a role. prevention is the key. to avoid stretch marks avoid rapid weight gain or loss. moisturize daily when pregnant. there is no exact cure for stretch marks; however products containing glycolic acids tretinoin or vitamin c help towards rebuilding the structure of your skin. for a more invasive option consider laser resurfacing. lasers work by stimulating collagen synthesis. for severe stretch marks you may want to consider evaluation by a plastic surgeon for surgical removal.

1. spend time in nature. sun exposure and natural light have been found to increase your mood. take a break during the day and be sure to step outside or go near a window to get your dose of mood-enhancing light. pay attention to the colors in nature when youre outdoors. what sounds do you hear? looking around your environment with a fresh pair of eyes can be a very relaxing experience. 2. move your body. the current recommendations for physical activity call for sixty minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise daily. sound daunting? make it fun! go for a walk as a family turn on the radio and dance or practice yoga balance poses. movement activities positively affect health by reducing blood pressure enhancing mood and strengthening bones. 3. laugh. laughter really is the best medicine. take a moment to remember a situation that you found humorous. as you vividly recall the details youll probably find that a smile spontaneously develops. tell jokes make funny faces or start laughing and see who laughs with you. it can be contagious! 4. express yourself creatively. expressive art therapy enables you to share inner thoughts or feelings when they are difficult to articulate verbally. engaging in art activities such as finger painting drawing coloring etc. may relieve feelings of anxiety. 5. listen to music. there are many benefits to listening to music from relaxation to enhancing sleep. 6. take a warm bath. there are many historical references to the healing properties of water. ancient spas originated near mineral springs and seas and were used by natural healers to support health. establishing a bedtime routine that includes a warm bath in a quiet room can help to promote sleep and feelings of calm after a long day. run a warm bath light a few candles and close the door to spend some quality time with you. 7. aromatherapy. this refers to the use of essential oils to improve health and wellbeing. oils are delivered to the body through inhalation or direct application to the skin. lavender lemon balm and sandalwood are the two most common oils used to promote relaxation and reduce anxiety. add a few drops to bath water or on a pillowcase. rub the oils between the palms of your hands and cup your hands to inhale a few deep breaths of the scent. use with caution if you have asthma or a skin condition associated with allergies. consult a physician before use. 8. gratitude journal. when were faced with lifes challenges we often see only the stressful situation and lose sight of all that we have to be thankful for in our lives. the next time life seems to hand you lemons try making lemonade by writing down ten things you appreciate in your life. it wont eliminate the stress but you may find that it helps to improve your mood and shift your perspective allowing you to see new possibilities to resolve stressful situations. 9. gentle massage. human touch is very powerful and can be quite nurturing. use a lotion or light massage oil to rub the feet and/or hands. there are numerous points on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet that may influence various systems within the body. a gentle massage can be both relaxing and stimulating. use this technique to help quell stress when it appears. 10. mindful breathing. the mind has a tendency to wander. our thoughts pull us into the past replaying moments that we cant recover or push us into the future as we worry about what has yet to come. the body is always in the present moment. noticing your breathing on purpose without feeling the need to change it brings us back to the present moment. it serves as an anchor. take a time-out to notice your breathing when you feel stressed or worried and pay attention to how your body feels.

everyone's at risk but those at greater risk are infants young children pregnant women and their unborn babies older adults and people with weakened immune systems (for example those with hiv/aids cancer diabetes kidney disease and transplant patients). some people may become ill after ingesting only a few harmful bacteria. others may remain symptom-free after ingesting thousands. to prevent food-borne illness keep these key actions in mind: wash your hands. keep raw meats and ready-to-eat foods  like salads  separated during preparation. cook foods to the proper temperature by using a food thermometer. refrigerate foods promptly and reheat leftovers to 165 degrees fahrenheit.
anemia generally has a very good prognosis and it may be curable in many instances. the overall prognosis depends on the underlying cause of anemia its severity and the overall health of the patient.
there are several ways to approach the evaluation and management of acid reflux also called gerd. the approach depends primarily on the frequency and severity of symptoms the adequacy of the response to treatment and the presence of complications. for infrequent heartburn the most common symptom of gerd lifestyle changes and an occasional antacid may be all that is necessary. if heartburn is frequent daily nonprescription-strength (over-the-counter) h2 antagonists may be necessary. a foam barrier also can be used with the antacid or h2 antagonist. if lifestyle changes and antacids nonprescription h2 antagonists and a foam barrier do not adequately relieve heartburn it is time to see a physician for further evaluation and to consider prescription-strength drugs. the evaluation by the physician should include an assessment for possible complications of gerd based on the presence of such symptoms or findings as: cough. asthma. hoarseness. sore throat. difficulty swallowing. unexplained lung infections. anemia (due to bleeding from esophageal inflammation or ulceration). clues to the presence of diseases that may mimic gerd such as gastric or duodenal ulcers and esophageal motility disorders should be sought. if there are no symptoms or signs of complications and no suspicion of other diseases a therapeutic trial of acid suppression with h2 antagonists often is used. if h2 antagonists are not adequately effective a second trial with the more potent ppis can be given. if treatment relieves the symptoms completely no further evaluation may be necessary and the effective drug the h2 antagonist or ppi is continued. if at the time of evaluation there are symptoms or signs that suggest complicated gerd or a disease other than gerd or if the relief of symptoms with h2 antagonists or ppis is not satisfactory a further evaluation by endoscopy (egd) definitely should be done. there are several possible results of endoscopy and each requires a different approach to treatment. if the esophagus is normal and no other diseases are found the goal of treatment simply is to relieve symptoms. if damage to the esophagus (esophagitis or ulceration) is found the goal of treatment is healing the damage. if complications of gerd such as stricture or barrett's esophagus are found treatment with ppis also is more appropriate. however the adequacy of the ppi treatment probably should be evaluated with a 24-hour ph study during treatment with the ppi. strictures may also need to be treated by endoscopic dilatation (widening) of the esophageal narrowing. if symptoms of gerd do not respond to maximum doses of ppi there are two options for management. the first is to perform 24-hour ph testing to determine whether the ppi is ineffective or if a disease other than gerd is likely to be present. if the ppi is ineffective a higher dose of ppi may be tried. the second option is to go ahead without 24-hour ph testing and to increase the dose of ppi. another alternative is to add another drug to the ppi that works in a way that is different from the ppi for example a promotility drug or a foam barrier. if necessary all three types of drugs can be used. if there is not a satisfactory response to this maximal treatment 24 hour ph testing should be done. patients should consider surgery if they have regurgitation that cannot be controlled with drugs. this recommendation is particularly important if the regurgitation results in infections in the lungs or occurs at night when aspiration into the lungs is more likely. patients also should consider surgery if they require large doses of ppis or multiple drugs to control their reflux. some physicians  primarily surgeons  recommend that all patients with barrett's esophagus should have surgery. this recommendation is based on the belief that surgery is more effective than treatment with drugs in preventing both the reflux and the cancerous changes in the esophagus. there are no studies however demonstrating the superiority of surgery over drugs for the treatment of gerd and its complications.
is he passing stools? this is a very important question because if he is not then it may point to obstruction. another possibility is that there may be some mild gastritis. you can manage the pain by giving syrup colicaid (simethicone) 5 ml only when there is the pain. for the vomiting you can give syrup ondem (ondansetron) 5 ml thrice a day for three days. wait for at least half an hour after giving ondem to give any food or water. i would also prefer if you get him evaluated physically since he is lethargic you said. he may be dehydrated. for further information consult a paediatrician online

most helpful answer i never heard of a case where an std was contracted from a bottle of old urine. i think you are safe even if you recently had an open wound on your hand. needless to say i assume that you wash your hands thoroughly after this exposure. as long as you are not showing any signs of a skin infection around this wound you are in the clear. urine is typically sterile (unless the person has a urinary tract infection) but i still would not want to have this old pee on my hands. you are wise to be concerned but it would not be likely you can catch any disease from this exposure. even if you did get a minor wound infection it would not be an std.
your reaction to finding lump in your breast is completely understandable and normal. i believe that your anxiety is really fear. anxiety and fear are interrelated conditions. anxiety causes fear and fear causes anxiety. but there are differences. anxiety is a common emotion that is usually due to some vague feeling of apprehension without an obvious threat. an example might be walking down a dark street alone at night and feeling afraid. fear on the other hand is an emotional response to a definite threat. for example someone approaches you on that same dark street and says stick them up. now you have a real threat and are justifiability fearful. that lump in your breast was a real threat and must be considered as a legitimate fear. once that fear is totally removed your anxious feelings should subside. until you get a clean bill of health from your 2nd opinion physician please attempt to direct your focus on the results of your first opinion. enjoy life enjoy your family and have fun. i hope that your wait to hear positive news this week is swift and that your emotional health is instantly restored.
"a good sonographer can most likely determine gender at 12 weeks with reasonable accuracy but at 13 weeks gender determination is close to 99% accurate. waiting until 18-20 weeks offers your ob more information so rather than just do a ""wiener"" search at 12 weeks it is best to be patient so see if you are having a little boy or girl. just because you are curious or anxious will not medically-justify an earlier sonogram. besides there is nothing that can change gender now!"
diaper rash is a common problem and i can tell you that there are a few things that parents can do to help prevent it and then there is also ways to treat it. preventing it what you want to do is make sure you change the baby frequently. you don't want them to sit in a white wet diaper all the day long and by actually cleaning the area very well and letting it air dry little bit before you put on the next diaper. you want to carry things in your house as far as wipes to make sure you clean the area throughly and use things something like desitin ointment which is a zinc oxide base. it actually will create a water-tight barrier that will help prevent moisture from staying on the skin. there is also boudreaux's butt paste which is another popular product just as good as desitin has the same active ingredient in it. if you notice though that the rash is becoming a little bit more inflamed and red seems to be spreading baby is running a fever then you want to have it checked out by your pediatrician. because they may actually need prescription medication because it could have became a little more fungal. speaking of fungal the one thing that i think a lot of parents do is put cornstarch on a baby when they are doing the diaper change and that is actually not something that you want to do. it actually help trap in fungus. so don't use any powder at all.
exercise uses fuel. the body's fuel is glucose which come from carbohydrates. that's the reason long-distance runners typically carbo-load before an event. and after a long run they usually need to refuel by consuming high-carb foods such as bagels bananas or fruit juice. strenuous exercise depletes fluids as well especially in hot weather. as for single nutrients stores of sodium potassium magnesium and some b vitamins may also be reduced after strenuous exercise. premenopausal female athletes may run a risk of iron deficiency. some sports medicine experts think that antioxidants may help athletes recover after a strenuous workout by neutralizing free radicals generated by exercise. that hasn't been proven however. and no single antioxidant stands out as particularly important. although vitamin/mineral formulas are marketed to athletes all of the nutrients that help power athletic performance can be found in a healthy diet with lots of fruits and vegetables.

it depends. if the patients are on the same exact plan then generally yes. but there are so many different types of insurance policies and doctors participate with some of them and not with others. what may look the same on the surface may actually be two different health insurance policies even if they're provided by the same insurer. and a physicians' panel can become full at which point he or she may stop taking new patients.

hi if you had rubella some time in your life your igg stays high which means your body is ready to fight it (immune) so i see no reason to be worried to be safe keep up having your baby check ups labs are not usually 100% accurate so i can not really explain the variance in results good luck
no. only u. s. citizens and legal immigrants can apply.
this is a very interesting question with many different opinions. some say you should not have your hair dyed. some say you can have highlights placed. part of the issue is when you have your hair dyed the chemicals will be more likely to be against your scalp and possibly be absorbed while those who have highlights will not have the chemicals be against the scalp and not be absorbed. we typically don't recommend having your hair dyed in the first trimester of pregnancy since this time is the most risky to the fetus. this time is called organogenesis where the organs are forming. when women ask me about dying their hair i usually ask is it imperative. most say it is not and so i say hold off. i offer highlights. my answers are not necessarily based on solid scientific data. it is more based on common sense which says if you don't need to put chemicals on your body during pregnancy you probably should not. my doctor told me to go for it! i was in my second trimester (towards the end of it) she said as long as it doesn't have ammonia in it or strong smelling chemicals i was fine  i had my baby girls with no problems from it. no

hi alcoholics tend to have night sweats because the body is actually starting to go through withdrawal while they are sleeping. the body is trying to rid itself of all of the toxins that excess alcohol can put in the body. if you are quitting drinking then make sure you are using breathable sheets on the bed such as cotton and keep a cool drink of water by the bed. it is important to stay hydrated because a lot of water is lost through the sweat. so your best bet would be give up the drink and become an ex-alcoholic its your life you have to think of and not the next drink. good luck

if you are pregnant right now and taking cymbalta (generic name: duloxetine) please see your health care professional as soon as possible to discuss the situation. in general duloxetine is not recommended for pregnant women but only your personal health care provider can determine if you should continue on cymbalta while pregnant or not. do not stop taking cymbalta abruptly. doing so can cause serious side effects. if you're not pregnant but plan on becoming pregnant you'd do well to consult with your health care provider before you conceive in order to discuss all of your medications. your health care provider can work with you to come up with a plan that helps meet both your own health needs and those of your unborn baby after you become pregnant. best wishes to you!
the chickenpox vaccine is recommended for all children under the age of 13 who have not had chickenpox. it is also recommended for all adolescents and adults who have not been vaccinated and have not had chickenpox. if you have had chickenpox there is no need for you to get the vaccine. since 2005 the vaccine has also been available as part of a combination vaccine called mmrv which offers protection against measles mumps rubella and varicella.
"squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common form of skin cancer. its a fairly slow-growing skin cancer usually found on areas of the body damaged by uv rays from the sun or tanning beds  the head, neck, ears, lips, arms, legs, and hands."
"the following are the different types of ringworm or tinea: tinea barbae: ringworm of the bearded area of the face and neck with swelling and marked crusting is often accompanied by itching sometimes causing the hair to break off. in the days when men went to the barber daily for a shave tinea barbae was called barber's itch. tinea capitis: ringworm of the scalp commonly affects children mostly in late childhood or adolescence. this condition may spread in schools. tinea capitis appears as scalp scaling that is associated with bald spots (in contrast to seborrhea or dandruff for instance which do not cause hair loss). tinea corporis: when fungus affects the skin of the body it often produces the round spots of classic ringworm. sometimes these spots have an ""active"" outer border as they slowly grow and advance. it is important to distinguish this rash from other even more common rashes such as nummular eczema. this condition and others may appear similar to ringworm but they are not due to a fungal infection and require different treatment. tinea cruris: tinea of the groin (""jock itch"") tends to have a reddish-brown color and extends from the folds of the groin down onto one or both thighs. other conditions that can mimic tinea cruris include yeast infections psoriasis and intertrigo a chafing rash which results from the skin rubbing against the skin. tinea faciei (faciale): ringworm on the face except in the area of the beard. on the face ringworm is rarely ring shaped. characteristically it causes red scaly patches with indistinct edges. tinea manus: ringworm involving the hands particularly the palms and the spaces between the fingers. it typically causes thickening (hyperkeratosis) of these areas often on only one hand. tinea manus is a common companion of tinea pedis (ringworm of the feet). it is also called tinea manuum. tinea pedis: athlete's foot may cause scaling and inflammation in the toe webs especially the one between the fourth and fifth toes. another common form of tinea pedis produces a thickening or scaling of the skin on the heels and soles. this is sometimes referred to as the ""moccasin distribution. "" in still other cases tinea causes blisters between the toes or on the sole. aside from athlete's foot tinea pedis is known as tinea of the foot or more loosely fungal infection of the feet. tinea pedis is an extremely common skin disorder. it is the most common and perhaps the most persistent of the fungal (tinea) infections. it is rare before adolescence. it may occur in association with other fungal skin infections such as tinea cruris (jock itch). tinea unguium: finally fungal infection can make the fingernails and more often the toenails yellow thick and crumbly. this is referred to as fungal nails or onychomycosis."
may be an infection process.
my husband also got a shingles vaccine last year and within two months got an awful case of bell's palsy. his doctor say the vaccine could not have caused the bell's palsy because the formula for this vaccine does not contain live virus culture. i remain skeptical because my husband also has a rare blood disorder. after his diagnosis with bell's i researched more and found that live culture vaccines are never recommended for anyone with a compromised immune system like my husband. still a neurologist specializing in bell's palsy has since told us that the cause may never be known so we can't narrow it down to a possible vaccine. his facial paralysis was almost gone 8 months later until today! symptoms are back we are starting over.
in addition to what the other contributor said it's possible that you are pregnant and the hormone is not yet strong enough to show up on the test. i went through the same thing when i was pregnant with my second child. the hcg hormone wasn't strong enough to show up until i was already 4 or 5 weeks late. another thing to consider is is you have always been irregular then pcos is a possibility too. if i were you i'd consult with an ob/gyn soon. at least that way you can get some real answers and maybe some stress relief.
hi just google this garlic to remove warts your find loads of info and right down the bottom there's a link to what causes warts. see lots of info. good luck
the nasolabial creases also known as the parentheses because their shape mimics parentheses are the curve-like grooves that begin where the nose meets the cheeks and typically end below the corners of the mouth. sometimes the muscle action in smiling can accentuate them. how do we get these? the answer is simple one word: aging. as we age nature spontaneously shrinks the fat layer in the face. the first area for the shrinkage to show is around the mouth because in fact it is the area where nature originally deposited the thinnest layer of fat. so as the fat diminishes the nasolabial groove becomes more prominent. expect this to begin even in the 40s. the good news is that we now have many products that can fill the grooves and make them look better. and by the way that is a far better answer than any mid-face or surgical facelift that claims to be able to pull out the nasolabial crease. that wont happen satisfactorily. what will happen is youll have that over-tight over-pulled look. weve all seen some unfortunate people who made a bad decision by having the procedure done and they look like the joker in the batman movie. its a bad look and it cannot be easily reversed. artefill is a long-lasting non-resorbable filler that works because within it are little spheres of purified collagen. the collagen acts as a base upon which the body can increase its own collage production and therefore fill the groove. not everyone is familiar with artefill. over 20 000 patients have been treated with it since the launch of the product nearly three years ago. the manufacturer states there have been no product recalls.  artefill is not the only substance that fills the nasolabial crease but it should be considered because of its long presence in the tissue. as you know some of the fillers last four to six months. as with all fillers when done by a skilled injector whether it be an md or an rn its very difficult to tell that the filler material has been injected. it looks natural and feels natural.

consuming more calories will help to increase your weight. here are a few healthy tips to follow to increase weight slowly: focus on healthy foods to gain weight. eat foods that are loaded with vitamins minerals nutrients and calories. you can enrich foods with nuts fruits and yogurt. eat more often. increasing the amount of calories you eat each day will help to gain weight. focus on eating 6 times a day with each meal containing a protein starch vegetable and some fat. for example turkey sandwich with mayonnaise on whole-grain bread with a fruit smoothie and carrots. since the weight loss resulted from an illness drinking more smoothies or meal replacements drinks consuming egg dishes and bland foods is the best way to transition back to a healthy diet. consult with your physician before you make any drastic changes to your eating habits. for more information on weight gain visit this website.

an epipen can be used for an anaphylactic allergic reaction caused by anything. if the person is having difficulty breathing generalized hives etc. that epipen is needed so you will have time to get to the emergency room. if the person just has an mild penicillin rash or mild hives epinephrine is not the preferred treatment.
first be sure that it is indeed hives (urticarial). it would be uncommon for hives just to occur in the genital area so see a medical provider so this skin eruption can be properly identified. if it is an allergic reaction some common causes would be soap or laundry detergents. otc hydrocortisone cream can be used safely in this sensitive area for an allergic response (hives is usually allergic) but if the cause is something other than allergy like a fungal skin eruption hydrocortisone cream could make things worse. this is why getting properly diagnosed first is the best step.

oh dear. it's never good to put antibiotic drops in the wrong orifice. in general any time you accidentally get something in your eye  whether it's prescription drops like ofloxacin or dust from the wind  you should take a moment to rinse your eyes with water. if you have saline solution (such as wetting solution for contact lenses) then use this. but if not then tap water will have to do. to rinse your eyes bend over a sink and allow the water to flow across your eyeball and down the drain. keep this up for 3-5 minutes. the good news for you is that ofloxacin is an antibiotic drop that is often prescribed for infections of the eye. so if you got a drop or two in your eye it probably will not cause any damage. you should still rinse it out if possible just to be safe. wishing you well!

frequency of sex has nothing to do with e. coli bacteria (escherichia coli). prostatitis is very resistant to treat so it is not necessary that if you have taken treatment it will not recur. sometimes you have to take 4 to 6 months of treatment for prostatitis. this is the main reason why you are still having the pain. semen and culture usually do not cover all std's (sexually transmitted diseases) and lower abdominal pain is a non specific symptom and can be attributed to prostatitis. yes hiv (human immunodeficiency virus) could be transmitted through oral sex. so if you know the person it is better to get her tested because if she is not hiv positive then you need no testing. nevertheless you can go for hiv 1 and 2 antibody test by elisa (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) method and hiv rt-pcr (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). i hope the above information is useful to you. for further queries consult a hiv aids specialist online  
there are many ways that people with epilepsy and their families can help with research on this disorder. pregnant women with epilepsy who are taking antiepileptic drugs can help researchers learn how these drugs affect unborn children by participating in the antiepileptic drug pregnancy registry which is maintained by the genetics and teratology unit of massachusetts general hospital (see section on pregnancy and motherhood). people with epilepsy that may be hereditary can aid research by participating in the epilepsy gene discovery project which is supported by the epilepsy foundation. this project helps to educate people with epilepsy about new genetic research on the disorder and enlists families with hereditary epilepsy for participation in gene research. people who enroll in this project are asked to create a family tree showing which people in their family have or have had epilepsy. researchers then examine this information to determine if the epilepsy is in fact hereditary and they may invite participants to enroll in genetic research studies. in many cases identifying the gene defect responsible for epilepsy in an individual family leads researchers to new clues about how epilepsy develops. it also can provide opportunities for early diagnosis and genetic screening of individuals in the family. people with epilepsy can help researchers test new medications surgical techniques and other treatments by enrolling in clinical trials. information on clinical trials can be obtained from the ninds as well as many private pharmaceutical and biotech companies universities and other organizations. a person who wishes to participate in a clinical trial must ask his or her regular physician to refer him or her to the doctor in charge of that trial and to forward all necessary medical records. while experimental therapies may benefit those who participate in clinical trials patients and their families should remember that all clinical trials also involve some risks. therapies being tested in clinical trials may not work and in some cases doctors may not yet be sure that the therapies are safe. patients should be certain they understand the risks before agreeing to participate in a clinical trial. patients and their families also can help epilepsy research by donating their brain to a brain bank after death. brain banks supply researchers with tissue they can use to study epilepsy and other disorders.

impportant news for parents of teens: the latest headlines in the sleep literature say teens who sleep less eat more. and they arent reaching for fruits and veggies. its not news to scientists whove found that people who sleep fewer than the hours their bodies need have a stronger craving for fatty foods and snacks. all of which can send a roaring teen metabolism on vacation and open the door to weight gain and obesity. but this latest study went a bit further to show a relationship between sleep duration and snacking a favorite food activity for teens:  for each one-hour increase in sleep duration the odds of consuming a high amount of calories from snacks decreased by an average of 21 percent.  a significantly greater proportion of teens who slept less than 8 hours per weeknight consumed food in the early morning between 5 a. m. and 7 a. m.  specifically the researchers found that â after adjusting for factors like age sex and race â teens who slept less than 8 hours on weeknights consumed 2. 2 percent more calories from fats and 3. 0 percent fewer calories from carbs than teens who slept 8 hours or more. news like this doesnt bode well for the future of our children given the fact sleep is last on their list of things to do. whats more 2. 2 percent more calories from fats may not seem like a lot but when you add it all up over time it can amount to a weighty number. the challenge: teaching our children to establish good sleep habits knowing that this may be part of the struggle we have in teaching healthy eating habits! unknowingly teens may be establishing a vicious cycle where their food choices are driven by their sleep choices. teenagers are likely to be saddled with body-image issues. an unbalanced diet in adolescence especially one with high fat content has both short- and long-term health consequences. if a lack of sleep is behind these eating habits try a conversation about sleep diet and health. how much of a sacrifice would it take for them to get to bed earlier? todays teens have many responsibilities heavy academic loads extracurricular activities and the typical teen social attractions and distractions all of which often make their list of priorities ahead of sleep maybe you can compromise on a reasonable bedtime try it out for a week and adjust it later. the good news is that the importance of sleep might motivate them to make a change â much more so than insisting that they eat their broccoli and take their vitamins. if they knew that a solid start to a healthy body is just a good nights sleep away  well you never know. it just might be the ticket to a healthier and maybe happier teenager. and a healthy happy household.

there soulc be the following reasons of back pain. most big problems start of as small problems that you don't address. treat back pain as a symptom of dysfunction not a cause. the cause of back pain is rarely at the site of the pain most people have slight postural imperfections which end up causing pain in other parts of their body. postural imperfections are magnified by such things as slouching over the computer holding the phone between ear and shoulder and by hand and foot dominance in the sports most regularly played. it's not the chair; it's how you sit in it. if muscles are not getting stronger they're getting weaker.

i dont' think that parents who use methamphetamines should be caring for any children. at any age. it is not the smoke but the drug use that is the problem. it is difficult enough being a parent but when the parent is chemically impaired (even if they think they are not) it can be dangerous. in older children watching their parents smoke crystal meth is not the best modeling as you know.
first congratulations on taking this important first step in reducing your weight to a healthy level! i salute you. second be sure you've received the ok from your health care provider to undertake a diet and exercise program. if your doctor has cleared you to exercise then your shortness of breath may be normal simply due to your current size. don't let this discourage you. it may not be realistic for you to expect to perform say 20 minutes of aerobic activity at this point. that time will come. right now 2 minutes might actually be more realistic for you. i'd suggest you start with simply walking. if you can manage to walk for 2 minutes 10 times a day there's your 20 minutes. do that every day and you'll gradually build up stamina. if you've been watching one of those television shows where 300+ pound people engage in vigorous workouts and lose dramatic amounts of weight quickly i'd suggest you stop watching. in my opinion those programs do not depict a realistic vision of exercise for people who weigh over 300 pounds. the workouts shown on those programs are closely monitored by an entire medical team and can be dangerous for the average unsupervised exerciser. again i can't stress how much i admire you for your determination. try checking out webmd's diet community for support and access to experts who can help you on your journey. be patient. it may take you quite some time to lose all the weight you want to lose. remember to set intermediate goals and rewards along the way to stay motivated. best wishes to you! dont give up! although you may not be able to exercise for long now you should expect to see less shortness of breath and better cardiovascular endurance the longer you stay consistent with your exercise routine. be sure that youre not trying to do too much with your exercise. it may be best to start out with a low intensity level of exercise and expanding upon it as tolerated. it may not seem like a lot at first but you can slowly and gradually build up the duration and intensity of your exercise the more that you are able to adhere to it. remember your exercise doesnt have to be done all in one session. divide it up and takes breaks to rest and recover if you need to and then pick it back up later. you may be able to continually shorten the amount of rest that you take in between sessions to eventually spend more time in a single session. also try building in more opportunities to incorporate more physically activity within your daily routine. try taking the stairs instead of the elevator or park further away. making a habit out of incorporating small opportunities like these can ultimately lead to becoming better conditioned for exercise. if exercise remains to be too difficult id still encourage you to continue to do what you can but id suggest placing more of an emphasis on your nutrition to lose enough weight until youre at the point that you can exercise more comfortably. keep up the great work! remember to always consult your doctor before beginning an exercise routine or weight loss plan. please keep one thing in mind. you did not gain the weight over a few months so don't expect it to magically fall off in a few months; there are no shortcuts just dedication and the will power you will need to get your butt off the couch and head outside (or treadmill) and walk everyday. at first just do what you can but make a training schedule and follow it - you are accountable to no one but yourself so don't let yourself down! i will not do you any favors by lying to you or telling you loosing weight is easy. as you know it is not. it is a long hard journey to loose the weight but if your mindset is right and your willpower is strong (do it for no one but yourself). then you are on your way to a successful weight loss journey! good luck! btw. before putting something in your mouth ask yourself if you are really hungry if you are not - ask yourself why you are eating. congrats on this big step in life! you can do it! however to safely do it i would go to your local ymca and have a professional check you out( your heart rate ect. ) they will put you on a plan that fits you!
yes you can still have a negative chlamydia test and potentially have chlamydia. much depends on the type of test you took (urine or vaginal smear if you are female or urine or urethral smear if you are male). not knowing the details of your exposure i am assuming that you had unprotected sex. do you know for a fact if this person has chlamydia or not? if you do know that you have been exposed you can elect to be treated regardless of the test result. when in doubt get re-tested and tested again sometime later. fear of an std can be eliminated or drastically reduced if you make sure you or your partner use condoms.
well vaginal discharge can occur due to a number of reasons depending upon the colour consistency etc however it is not commonly related to cervical cancer as cervical cancer is associated with number of other symptoms like pelvis or backacke vaginal pain and excess bleeding weight loss etc. the symptoms that you are facing are probably due to vaginal thrush or vaginal yeast infection or many other causes. a vaginal swab culture can help in ruling out the cause. do not worry about cancer as the symptoms are not appearing consistent with it. hope this helps. regards.

there are many conditions that can mimic food allergy. the possibilities include not only food allergy but also any other diseases that have symptoms brought on by food. these include reactions to certain chemicals in food for example histamine or food additives food poisoning several other gastrointestinal diseases and psychological symptoms. histamine toxicity: some natural substances (for example histamine) in foods can cause reactions resembling allergy. histamine can reach high levels in cheese some wines and certain fish particularly tuna and mackerel. in fish the histamine is believed to stem from bacterial contamination especially in fish that has not been refrigerated properly. histamine toxicity has been referred to as pseudoallergic fish poisoning and accounts for over one-third of seafood-related food-borne illnesses according to the u. s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc). food additives: another type of food intolerance is an adverse reaction to certain compounds that are added to food to enhance taste provide color or protect against the growth of microorganisms. consumption of large amounts of these additives can produce symptoms that mimic the entire range of allergic symptoms. the compounds most frequently tied to adverse reactions that can be confused with food allergy are yellow dye number 5 monosodium glutamate (msg) and sulfites. yellow dye number 5 can cause hives although rarely. sulfites occur naturally in some foods and wines and are added to others to enhance crispness or prevent the growth of mold. in high concentrations sulfites can pose problems for people with severe asthma. food poisoning: eating food that is contaminated with microorganisms such as bacteria and their products such as toxins is the usual cause of food poisoning. thus the ingestion of contaminated eggs salad milk or meat can produce symptoms that mimic food allergy. common microbes that can cause food poisoning include the noroviruses campylobacter jejuni salmonella listeria monocytogenes vibrio vulnificus and e. coli 0157:h7. lactase deficiency (lactose intolerance): another cause of food intolerance which often is confused with a food allergy specifically to milk is lactase deficiency. this common food intolerance affects at least one out of 10 people. lactase is an enzyme in the lining of the small intestine. this enzyme digests or breaks down lactose a complex sugar in milk to simple sugars which are then absorbed into the blood. if a person has lactase deficiency he does not have enough lactase to digest the lactose in most milk products. instead other bacteria in the intestine use the undigested lactose thereby producing gas. symptoms of lactose intolerance include bloating abdominal pain and diarrhea. gluten-sensitive enteropathy: intolerance to gluten occurs in a disease called gluten-sensitive enteropathy or celiac sprue. gluten-sensitive enteropathy is caused by a unique abnormal immune response to certain components of gluten which is a constituent of the cereal grains wheat rye and barley. although sometimes referred to as an allergy to gluten this immune response involves a branch of the immune system that is different from the one involved in a classical food allergy. other gastrointestinal diseases: several other gastrointestinal diseases produce abdominal symptoms (especially nausea vomiting diarrhea and pain) that are sometimes caused by food. these diseases therefore can resemble food allergies. examples include peptic ulcer gallstones non-ulcer dyspepsia (which is a type of indigestion) crohn's disease (regional enteritis) cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and a rare condition called eosinophilic gastroenteritis. psychological: some people have a food intolerance that has a psychological origin. in these people a careful psychiatric evaluation may identify a traumatic event in that person's life often during childhood tied to eating a particular food.

pimple is somewhat hormonal and due to oily skin. remember the following measures to control pimples. do not use hair oil and avoid oily foods chocolates and milk products. do not use any steroid creams. face wash and soaps are not the treatment and they do not help. do not touch the acne and avoid pressing it. regarding treatment of pimple i suggest clindamycin (clintop faceclin or clear gel). this is more of preventive and curative so i tell patients to use it all over face in the morning and use adapalene gel (adapalene or differin) over acne in the night. i also suggest you to take tablet doxy (doxycycline) 100 mg once in a day. consult your doctor discuss with him/her and take the medicine with consent. if you have acne marks avoid direct sunlight exposure as much as you can. wear sunglass cap and cover exposed part of your body all the time use sunscreen thrice in a day such as 10 am 12 pm and 3 pm. it has to be applied all over the face. sunscreen spf (sun protection factor) should be around 50. use anti-pigmentation cream over pigmented parts like kojic acid hydroquinone depiwhite cream etc. in the night. ideal treatment is glycolic acid peels. sittings of six to eight peels must be required. post acne scars are three types. box scar ice-pick (pinpoint scars) and rolling scars. pinpoint scars are difficult to treat while box scars are easy. no cream or tablet can help you out in scars. best technique is co2 fractional laser and subscision. it takes five to six sitting but results are better than any other procedure. dermaroller and subscision are also other methods but less effective than the above. fillers do have hiding effect. it fills the pits and gives impression of fullness and it is not permanent. if scars are not much prominent then peels also could be effective. these are technique you can go through. all procedures take four to five sitting and five to six months for better results. for further information consult a dermatologist online

the fact is that with or without health-care reform we're facing a doctor shortage in this country. the association of medical colleges anticipates a 21 000 shortage of primary-care doctors â the medical professionals who play perhaps the most central and critical role in the success of reform  by 2015. with an additional 32 million americans expected to gain access to health insurance that trend along with other factors contributing to the shortage is only expected to grow. affordable care act and jobs so what's being done? the law outlines a number of programs to support the development of 16 000 new primary-care health providers over the next five years just as a start. some of those efforts include:  creating additional spots in primary-care residency programs.  increasing the number of trained nurse practitioners who are central to the delivery of primary care.  providing funds to train additional physician assistants who practice medicine under the supervision of a physician.  providing grants to states to create innovative programs to grow their primary-care work force.  scholarships and loan repayment programs for doctors (who often graduate medical school saddled with debt).  promoting medical residency (training) programs in rural and other underserved areas and offering tax benefits to medical professionals who work in underserved areas. shifting our approach beefing up our medical work force is critical but it's not likely to be enough to meet the coming demand. as a result the law also calls for a shift in the way health care is practiced. for example there are a number of pilot projects that will test new medical practice models aimed at helping doctors and nurses better manage the care of people with chronic health conditions. these projects will emphasize a team approach in primary-care settings as well as ongoing relationships between patients and primary-care providers. stronger coordination among primary and specialty care and greater participation on the part of the patient and his or her family will also be encouraged. putting money on the line encouragement won't come in the form of a pep talk and a pat on the back; the goal is to financially reward providers for keeping people healthy. that's a switch from the system that predominates today  a fee-for-service model  in which doctors are paid only when they provide a service. that encourages more services not necessarily better or more appropriate care. under reform the idea is to switch to a bundled or salary-based payment model whereby providers will earn greater financial rewards as quality of care and the health of those they treat improves. sounds simple but this represents a major shift in the way our system currently operates. will it work? that remains to be seen.

"viral meningitis is more common and usually less serious. it tends to occur more often in the summer and fall. because of its flu-like symptoms many people mistake it for the flu. viruses that cause ""stomach flu"" are a cause of vir al meningitis but most people who have these infections don't develop meningitis. others viruses that lead to meningitis are those that cause chickenpox mononucleosis (mono) and herpes. sympt oms can be similar to those of bacterial meningitis."

the first question that pops to mind is whether you got prior authorization from your insurer before having the procedure. this is typically required and failing to follow the plan's rules will result in your claim being denied. if that's not the issue you want to check to make sure the procedure was billed correctly. contact your insurer and your provider to see if by simply resubmitting the claim the issue can be fixed. if it's an argument over medical necessity or some other disagreement about what your plan should or shouldn't cover you have the right to file an appeal requiring your insurer to reconsider its decision and a second level appeal to an outside independent party if that first appeal doesn't go your way. your insurer is required to provide you with written information about how to file an appeal. you may want to enlist the help of your provider when doing so.
sure. i deal with this every day. just keep your hands clean and don't rub your own eyes. pink eye (conjunctivitis) will not jump off of the baby into your eyes. besides if the baby is already on antibiotic drops they are probably not very contagious.

the primary approach to properly managing acid reflux shouldnt be in promoting certain foods instead of others but rather in identifying and avoiding foods that trigger symptoms. basically you shouldnt focus on what to eat but rather what to avoid. in that regard here are some of the common foods that can trigger acid reflux:  fatty foods  acidic foods like citrus fruits or tomatoes and tomato-containing products  coffee caffeinated beverages or alcohol  chocolate or peppermint  spicy foods i would suggest keeping a journal to write down your dietary intake daily so that you can notice trends and so that you will be able to identify potential triggers as you notice symptoms. also its recommended to refrain from lying down after a meal eating too much in one sitting or eating too quickly. quitting smoking and losing weight may also alleviate symptoms. if you are experiencing acid reflux symptoms remedies might include over the counter antacid tablets or prescription medication. certain alkaline foods may help to neutralize acid reflux but its more important to prevent acid reflux from occurring in the first place by avoiding triggers. please visit the webmd heartburn/gerd health center for more information.
this is a vexing problem for post-menopausal women. i'm sorry you're going through it. while hormone therapy (often estrogen cream delivered directly to the vaginal tissue) is usually recommended to help with the dryness and atrophy (shrinking) of the vagina after menopause other options are available. assuming you're not allergic to any of the ingredients you could try an over-the-counter vaginal moisturizer such as replens brand. this is not the same thing as lubricant used during sex. a vaginal moisturizer works to keep delicate vaginal tissues moist and supple. at least that's the theory. i don't know about the science behind it but it probably can't hurt. there are several brands of vaginal moisturizers on the market. an old-fashioned method to maintain vaginal tissue health is the boric acid suppository. ask your gynecologist about this. you can have boric acid suppositories prepared at a compounding pharmacy. they work to help moisturize and maintain the ph of vaginal tissue. most important don't give up. keep talking to your gynecologist about the problem because new products and strategies for dealing with vaginal dryness are constantly being developed. wishing you well!

hi you should find this info very interesting and the way chlamyda can hide for many years. most unfortunate is the ability of chlamydia to hide itself deep inside the genitourinary tract making it very difficult to detect by urethral swabbing and urine analysis; two commonly used sample collection methods for chlamydia testing in clinical practice. thus many urologists and std doctors are unable to identify chlamydia as a causative pathogen. as a result they often make general diagnosis such as non-specific urethritis prostatitis and/or pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) etc. and they frequently prescribe a variety of ineffective broad-spectrum antibiotics making the patients condition more complicated; weakening the immune system causing antibiotic resistance failing to address causative pathogens and allowing the infection to spread etc. do hope this helps good luck

atherosclerosis prevention should start early preferably during childhood and adolescence. most scientists believe that preventing atherosclerosis is more effective than trying to reverse established blockages or getting rid of plaques in the arteries. therefore children and adolescents should be taught lifetime habits of regular exercise avoidance of smoking and good nutrition. unfortunately many americans have not taken adequate steps to prevent atherosclerosis. reasons for this failure include: lack of awareness that they already have coronary atherosclerosis and ignorance that coronary atherosclerosis and heart attacks are preventable. lack of awareness of their blood cholesterol levels and profiles. unwillingness or inability to quit cigarette smoking. high blood pressure or diabetes that are either undiagnosed or inadequately controlled. lack of exercise an excess of fat and cholesterol in their diet and an inability to lose excess weight. failure to take full advantage of medications that improve cholesterol profiles usually out of fear of potential side effects.

you can buy a plan on the marketplace but evaluate this decision very carefully. employer health insurance is tax advantaged meaning you receive the benefit without having to pay taxes on its value. if you buy your own coverage you'll lose that as well as whatever portion of your coverage your employer helps pay for (most employers cover 70%-80% of employees' health benefit costs). that's all to say yes you can leave your employer's plan and buy your own coverage but in most cases it's not in your best financial interest to do so. just tread carefully. and you won't be able to make any changes outside of open enrollment unless there's some big event like a job loss.
"kettlebells have several benefits: they are inexpensive portable and effective at building cardiovascular endurance and muscular strength. with the wide variety of exercises possible with a kettlebell anyone can get an excellent workout using just a single one. instructors generally recommend healthy women begin with a 17 lb. kettlebell while men begin with a 26 lb. kettlebell. staying on top of a fitness plan is always a challenge when youre traveling. however due to their small size and ease of transport kettlebells really can be taken and used anywhere. in addition two recent studies in the journal of strength and conditioning research found that kettlebell routines can significantly improve cardiovascular endurance and muscle strength. kettlebells are a solid investment for anybody looking to improve their endurance and strength. however they can only help you if used the right way. be sure to find a knowledgeable professional in your area to review the exercises. kettlebell exercises involve ballistic movements (swinging). they are inherently dangerous to the person using them to property in the area they are used in and to other people in the vicinity of their use. they also do not give you an even resistance through the range of motion: they can put dangerous levels of torque on joints. compare taking a dumb-bell and doing an overhead press with doing the same thing with a kettlebell. with the the kettlebell the full weight will be directly above the hand and wrist at the maximum extension awkwardly poised on the handle extension of the kettlebell making it very easy to lose balance and twist and injure the wrist either at the top of the extension or when beginning to lower the weight. if however while doing the overhead press equivalent with the kettlebell you allow the main weight to ""hang down "" so the handle is ""on top"" you also risk putting severe strain on the wrist. anyone over 50 over-weight or with any form of back or joint problems arthritis etc. or any medical condition that affects balance should not use them. in my opinion they should only be used in controlled environments supervised by professionals and with safety equipment in place (heavy matting on nearby walls and floors and adequate space between the user and any other person or objects). personally i think they are a fad a danger and should be banned. there are many other safe and sane ways to get either aerobic or anaerobic exercise or both."

if the boy parts touch the girl parts whether you ejaculate or not there is always a small chance that pregnancy could occur. sperm can be viable in the clear mucous that emits from your penis during sexual excitation. the chance is very remote however so i think you are good. this time. if your girlfriend is also having sex with someone else that would be a different story. having a little scare like this is good practice if you continue with your risky sex-play you are eventually going to have sex. why not try and prevent it? your partner should be on an effective method of birth control and you should be wearing a condom. an erect penis is a loaded weapon my worried friend.
"mitral valve regurgitation might cause fatigue and shortness of breath. the blood coming through the left side of your heart fuels your body, bringing oxygen from your lungs to your cells. if some of that blood is flowing back into the heart instead, you might end up feeling tired or lightheaded, particularly if youve been active. in severe cases, you can find yourself feeling tired or short of breath even when youre at rest."
there's no simple answer to your question however the absolute best option for anyone with type 2 diabetes is exercise and weight management. here's a short synopsis: by the time you are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes around 50% of your beta cells are lost [ and your body's resistance to the action of insulin has been longstanding]. the decline in beta cell function is predictable. it's an absolute fact that treatment of type 2 diabetes with one drug alone won't work to control blood sugars. the decline continues regardless of therapy with metformin or sulfonylureas drugs like xyz. however lifestyle changes like diet and exercise seem to slow the loss of beta cell function by improving insulin sensitivity. other drugs may also stabilize beta cells. after we eat insulin works primarily on muscles. muscles are also the primary site of insulin resistant. by engaging in routine physical activity we use muscles which uses sugar as a source of energy. we also burn excess fat. together these actions result in less insulin resistant improved insulin function and fitness.
could the pain be from your ovary? yes of course. because you are also having problems conceiving you need to make an appointment with your gynecologist for a full work-up diagnostic lab tests and some imaging studies of your ovaries. you don't have appendicitis because appendicitis is not a come and go pain. appendicitis is extremely painful. the thing you have is actually caused by extra fluid form your system being trapped in your air vent. but if you are trying to become pregnant do not put too much pressure on yourself. that is probably why you have abdomen pain. and you can also take women pills for pregnancy. that wont really make you pregnant but it will prepare your body for pregnancy. you should check in with a doctor and tell him or her that you have abdomen pain and you think it is from your ovaries.

you probably [don't] know much about mini warts (or technically speaking molluscum contagiosum). every summer parents bring their kids in with curious little rashes that just dont seem to go away. they are tiny firm raised flesh-colored bumps that often show up in the armpit the back of the knees the trunk the forearm or the inner thigh. (the only place they dont show up are the palms and soles. ) so what are they? a virus. yes these tiny warts are caused by a virus. and yes that means they are contagious. they spread from person-to-person by direct contact with the spots. and kids can spread them around their own bodies by scratching and picking at them. the spots are kind of itchy but they are really more of a nuisance than a serious health issue. kids with eczema tend to have more problems because the itchy spots lead to scratching which leads to eczema flare-ups. if left alone the molluscum eventually goes away. but eventually can mean 6 months or 4 years. molluscum isnt just a summer virus but i do see more kids with it after spending their summer in the swimming pool. studies looking at the ability of the virus to spread in a chlorinated pool have been inconclusive thus far. thus there are no regulations restricting kids from public swimming pools when theyve got those spots. (besides the fact that one in 10 kids would have to stay out of a pool if there was a rule thats how common molluscum is! ) the molluscum virus also seems to spread through non-chlorinated water (like your bathtub). if one of your kids has molluscum do not let him share a bath or a drying off towel with your other kids. about 40% of kids with molluscum will spread it to their sibling. if you want to get rid of the molluscum before they decide to go away on their own i suggest speaking to your childs doctor or consulting a dermatologist. there are a variety of methods none of which is 100% successful or pain-free. so you should consider the options before proceeding.

a lack of iron can cause anemia and iron deficiency is a very common cause of anemia. this is because iron is major component of hemoglobin and is essential for its proper function. chronic blood loss for any reason is the main cause of low iron levels in the body as it can deplete its iron stores to compensate for the ongoing loss of blood. anemia that is due to low iron levels is called iron deficiency anemia. women are more likely than men to have iron deficiency anemia because of the loss of blood each month through normal menstruation. this is generally without any major symptoms as the blood loss is relatively small and temporary. iron deficiency anemia can also be due to small repeated instances of blood loss for instance from colon cancer or from stomach ulcers. stomach ulcer bleeding may be induced by medications even by very common over-the-counter drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen (advil motrin). in infants and young children iron deficiency anemia is most often due to a diet lacking in iron. a doctor's interpretation of complete blood count (cbc) results may give clues to suggest this type of anemia. for instance iron deficiency anemia usually occurs with low mean corpuscular volume (microcytic anemia) in addition to low hemoglobin.

hi if the surgeon has felt that 3 anchors would do the job and if the repair is strong enough then this may be sufficient. depends on the quality of your muscles and bones actually. but we do use 3-4 anchors for a strong repair. broken anchor well it would have been better had it been removed but its removal is risky at times and is better left that removed. wont cause you any problems

you can use 1% hydrocortisone cream on the skin of your penis for eczema followed by a good moisturizer. skin irritation including eczema is very common on the penis. it's best to treat the itching and irritation with a penis health creme that has natural moisturizing ingredients. shea butter is one of the best options for this and a creme called man1 man oil contains it as well as many other ingredients that can help maintain the health of the penis. hi sorry forgot to add that coconut oil (extra virgin) is also very good for you skin and if you do use olive oil? extra virgin is best. just in case you are sexually active just remember oils and condoms do not go together its breaks then down why having sex. so best you wash your penis before using condoms. hope this helps you. good luck hi ok good old baby oil is very good for your skin olive oil is also very good for skin and lots of other things apart from cooking its even very good as a sexual lubricant helps fight yi's. and last nothing wrong with aloe vera this is really good for your skin great if you get sunburnt. even better if can get a bit off the plant. as these are all very natural a lot better than some made up oil with things added to make it look good. do hope this helps you and your penis. good luck by far the best penis health creme out there is man1 man oil. i use this one for dry skin and it works great. all natural ingredients lots of vitamins and nutrients and even some shea butter. a creme like this is way better than any other oil or lotion because it is made just for the penis skin. definitely check it out.

it is my experience that most people do well after stopping the allergy shots. the typical treatment course is 3-5 years but is tailored based on each person's case. in some instances patients remain on the vaccine longer. at some point it is worth repeat skin testing as people's allergic sensitivities change over time and with immunotherapy.
hi your find that called a shy bladder not much you can di for that try running a tap the sound of running water works for most of us or running your hands under cold water. ok good luck
i have no idea since i have no way of examining you. my suggestion would be for you to see a gynecologist (they are surgeons) to see if you can have this aberrant tissue (whatever it is) removed.
on average it takes a normal couple one year to get pregnant. have intercourse every other day not every day (every day reduces sperm counts). and if you want to be more accurate use ovulation test strips. you are most fertile 3 days before you ovulate to 1 day after ovulation. answer test strips are my favorite because they offer 20 strips a month for you to test on (great if you have irregular cycles). the second line on the strip will often be darker than the control line when you do ovulate. keep track of your cycles on a calendar so you know approximately when you ovulate so you can target the days you try to conceive better. if it goes past a year or if your monthly cycles are over 35 days (from the first day of your period to your next first day) you can go to the doctor and get checked out but chances are you just need a little more time! good luck!
"you don't say if you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes and it makes something of a difference. if you take insulin to control your diabetes you could be experiencing either the ""dawn phenomenon"" or the somogyi effect. it's important to determine what's causing your elevated (though not outrageously i might add) blood sugars in the morning. while the dawn phenomenon is a natural occurrence the somogyi effect can be a result of eating too little of a bedtime snack. before you change your pre-sleep eating habits you should consult with your doctor to discover if the problem is a result of eating or of poor insulin timing. if you don't take insulin to control your diabetes then i'd recommend you eat a protein-rich snack before bedtime. good choices include natural peanut butter (without added sugar) either by itself or on whole-grain crackers some low-fat (or part-skim) string cheese with a small apple or lean meat (such as turkey breast) either by itself or with a slice of whole-grain bread. if you have any questions about controlling your sugars please consult your primary care provider or a certified diabetes educator. best to you!"
hi st your age ef should be above 60 %. other gradients and velocities have definitely down-graded. you need to do more cardio exercises and improve heart functioning. regular follow ups and 2-d echoes should be done to keep a watch on these quotients. take a second opinion from another cardiologist. thanks

as is true with any medication high blood pressure drugs have side effects. among the most common are the following: diuretics: headache weakness joint or muscle pain and low potassium blood levels. angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors: dry and persistent cough headache diarrhea and high potassium blood levels. angiotensin receptor blockers: fatigue dizziness or fainting muscle pain and diarrhea. calcium channel blockers: dizziness trouble breathing heart rhythm problems and ankle swelling. beta-blockers: dizziness or lightheadedness decreased sexual ability drowsiness and low heart rate.
well yes and no. incentive spirometers generally are used by patients after surgery or by people who suffer from an injury (such a fractured rib) that causes them not to breathe well or deeply. as you slowly breathe in through the spirometer it causes inflation of the small sacs in the lungs called alveoli. inflating the alveoli helps keep them free of fluid build-up. fluid build-up in the alveoli can lead to pneumonia. in a healthy individual using an incentive spirometer could theoretically increase air flow which would aid in lung function. studies have not shown that using an incentive spirometer increases or improves lung function in individuals with chronic pulmonary obstructive disorder (copd) or other chronic lung problems. i hope this is helpful!
depends on how you are tested. hair testing can detect cannabis use for months; urine tests for 3-4 weeks. the sensitivity of the lab doing the testing is also a factor. some labs are more skilled at detecting past drug use.
carbon monoxide poisoning happens when you breathe too much carbon monoxide. carbon monoxide is a gas produced by burning any type of fuel-gas oil kerosene wood or charcoal. what makes carbon monoxide so dangerous is that when you breathe it it replaces the oxygen in your blood. without oxygen cells throughout the body die and the organs stop working. you can't see smell or taste carbon monoxide. but if you breathe too much of it it can become deadly within minutes. so its very important to know the signs of carbon monoxide poisoning what to do if you have the symptoms and how to keep it from happening. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

the penis has never been known for its beauty and appearance so don't worry about the wrinkles since only you are probably the only one seeing it. a sexual partner is more likely to see or experience the non-wrinkled version. there are not wrinkle-removers or penis-lifts so it is what it is.

the only way that a women can get pregnant without sex is though artificial insemination something that i know you have not done. being late on your period is very very common in women especially young women and does not mean pregnancy especially in someone who has never had a sexual relationship. most of the time your period will straighten out on its own in another cycle. if not you can see your medical provider but please do not worry that you are pregnant.

ok you are having hair on your chin and acne also then it means you are suffering from hirsutism in which excess growth of hairs on the face or body are normal. and as you told that you are not pcod then you need to treat it by opting dianette whose generic name is cypoterone. you can get it easily at your doorstep from online pharmacies like meds247online etc.
since you indicate that social anxiety seems to be a primary problem for you it would seem that working with a cognitive psychologist who could provide direction and structure regarding social situations would be a good idea. i'm thinking about a psychologist who would provide weekly homework assignments very simple at first so that you can begin to build your comfort in social situations. in my book i have at least one chapter devoted to this topic and you might want to stop by the library and take a look at it. socializing is a skill that all of us need to develop and you're right it doesn't come easily. i understand what you mean when you say you're fine but when you're about to meet new people you become anxious. that happens to a lot of people. you're also right that over analyzing just makes you feel worse and what you fear is happening probably isn't happening at all. i'm referring of course to thinking what people are thinking about you or what they might be saying war that you won't be able to hold your own in a conversation. everything can be handled with the right type of guidance. i think you should give therapy specifically cognitive therapy aimed at social anxiety another try.
no eating fruit is great because it's healthy and sweet. and most people don't get nearly enough fruits and vegetables i n their diet. fruit contains vitamins antioxidants and fiber. of course if you're not hungry or are full than eating more food  even fruit  is not beneficial.
hi this is from matthew hoffman md here on webmd. hope its the answer your looking for. its uncommon (though not unheard of) for shingles to affect the external area around the vagina called the vulva. its very unusual for shingles to affect the inside of the vagina itself but it can occur. shingles is the common name for herpes zoster the painful rash that results from reactivation of varicella virus in adulthood. most of us are infected by varicella virus as children when it causes chickenpox. after we recover from chickenpox varicella doesnt disappear but rather goes dormant hiding inside nerves under our skin for years. later in life varicella can erupt on the skin to cause the painful rash called herpes zoster or shingles. (varicella is in the herpes virus family but is distinct from hsv-1 and hsv-2 the herpes viruses that commonly affect the lips and genitals. ) varicella is much more likely to affect external skin than moist mucous membranes inside the mouth or vagina. ulcers or sores on the vagina are more often due to hsv-1 or hsv-2 (herpes infections). taking a viral culture from the site of a fresh ulcer is the only way to know for sure though. do hope this helps you. good luck
yes that would actually be fine. singulair works differently than zyrtec. zyrtec is an antihistamine. the one thing is though is that it may cause a little bit of increase in a drowsiness side effect. so what i recommend for patients is try taking it at home first and see how you feel before you decide to go out and take it road trip to florida or something like that because you wanna see how your body adjusts to taking these two medications together.

it's never too early to consider heart health especially in terms of prevention. there are key factors that put you at higher risk for hardening of the arteries (the medical term is atherosclerosis). risk factors include a family history of heart disease abnormal blood lipid levels (high cholesterol/low hdl/high ldl/ high triglycerides) poor eating habits smoking high blood pressure and having diabetes. the american heart association recommends cardiovascular screening starting at age 20 so if you haven't already visit your doctor. for more on risk factors for atherosclerosis see this webmd post.
condoms are sheaths designed to fit tightly over an erect penis. their role is to prevent semen from entering the vagina. condoms are made of rubber (latex) synthetic materials (often polyurethane) or natural skin from animals like lambs. latex and synthetic condoms are better at protecting against sexually transmitted diseases. why? because natural skin condoms have tiny pores that may permit the passage of viruses.

"emphysema and chronic bronchitis are chronic (long-term) lung diseases that make it hard to breathe. both diseases are chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (copd) meaning they are conditions that cause a limitation in airflow. emphysema and chronic bronchitis can occur separately or together and are usually the result of cigarette smoking. in addition although it happens rarely a genetic form of emphysema can occur early in adulthood even if you never smoked. in the united states copd is vastly underdiagnosed. while only 15% to 20% of smokers are diagnosed with copd experts believe the majority of smokers develop some degree of airflow obstruction. emphysema comes on gradually after years of exposure to irritants such as cigarette smoke. with emphysema the tiny air sacs in the lungs become damaged. because the tiny sacs lose their ""stretch "" less air gets in and out of the lungs. this causes you to feel short of breath. with chronic bronchitis the airways that carry air to the lungs are inflamed and produce a lot of mucus. the mucus and inflammation cause the airways to narrow or become obstructed making it difficult to breathe. once the airways are irritated over a long period the lining of the airways becomes thickened. this thickening of the airways results in an irritating cough hampered airflow and lung scarring. the damaged airways then become a breeding place for bacterial infections such as pneumonia."
"hearing loss would generally be caused by a problem with the ear or a problem with transmitting sound from the ear to the brain. it sounds like you have had tests to detect any brain or nerve problem. i would have to assume at this point you have also seen an ent (ear nose and throat) doctor to have your ear thoroughly examined. sometimes it can be tough to identify the cause of ringing in the ears or white noise-type sounds like you describe with associated hearing loss. the only recommendation i can offer at this point is to work closely with an ent doctor to keep searching for what might be causing it as the list of possibilities is lengthy. based on your symptoms i am not able to tell what might be going on. i am sure you have done quite a bit of research on your own at this point but a search on ""hearing loss"" on webmd will bring up a host of useful information. to get started here's information on the most common causes of hearing loss. did any doctor call it ""tinnitus? "" if that's what it is here are some reasons why you might have it that i found. not sure though that this is helpful if you do not have tinnitus. ""the most common cause of tinnitus is hearing loss that occurs with aging (presbycusis) but it can also be caused by living or working around loud noises (acoustic trauma). tinnitus can occur with all types of hearing loss and may be a symptom of almost any ear disorder. other possible causes of tinnitus include: a buildup of earwax. medicines especially antibiotics or large amounts of aspirin. drinking an excessive amount of alcohol or caffeinated beverages. ear infections or eardrum rupture. dental or other problems affecting the mouth such as temporomandibular (tm) problems. injuries such as whiplash or a direct blow to the ear or head. injury to the inner ear following surgery or radiation therapy to the head or neck. a rapid change in environmental pressure (barotrauma). severe weight loss from malnutrition or excessive dieting. repeated exercise with the neck in a hyperextended position such as when bicycle riding. blood flow (vascular) problems such as carotid atherosclerosis av malformations and high blood pressure (hypertension). nerve problems (neurologic disorders) such as multiple sclerosis or migraine headache. other diseases. these may include: acoustic neuroma. anemia. labyrinthitis. meniere's disease. otosclerosis. thyroid disease. most tinnitus that comes and goes does not require medical treatment. you may need to see your doctor if tinnitus occurs with other symptoms does not get better or go away or is in only one ear. there may not be a cure for tinnitus but your doctor can help you learn how to live with the problem and make sure a more serious problem is not causing your symptoms. i also found this article on home treatments: "

the short answer is: it depends. the type of plan you have as well as how your employer (assuming you get your insurance through work) has structured benefits will impact how your deductible is met. according to michael thompson of pricewaterhousecoopers health and welfare practice most plans have an individual and a family deductible. satisfying your deductible generally works like this: ppos and deductibles with a traditional ppo-style plan (preferred provider organization) if one person in your family meets his or her individual deductible benefits will kick in for that person. under the traditional ppo approach the individual would be in benefit even though the family deductible has not yet been met  thompson says. in any case you wont pay more than the total family deductible before insurance begins to pick up the bill for care meaning if you have five members in your family each member wont need to meet the individual deductible. high-deductible plans its a different story with high deductible hsa-qualified plans. in these arrangements if youre covering a family its the larger family deductible (as opposed to the individual deductible) that must be met in order for your benefits to take effect. if you have a $1 500 individual deductible and a $3 000 family deductible the plan wont pay any expenses before the aggregate expenses of the family exceed $3 000  thompson says. in some cases thompson says employers offering health insurance may elect to treat their deductibles the same with all plan types which is why you always need to check to be certain how your benefits operate to avoid expenses you didnt plan for.
there are lots of healthy ways to lose weight but the key is to determine why you gained weight the the first place and work on that. is it a lack of activity? stress? not planing meals? poor cooking skills? diets work short-term but are more difficult to sustain over the long haul when those same issues that cause the weight gain come back. why go to the trouble of losing weight if your likely to gain it back? i suggest seeing a registered dietitian (you can find one at (eatright. org). a dietitian can help you figure out why you have gained weight and develop a realistic plan for moving forward and gradually losing weight. good luck! for more reading see: 5 surprising reasons you're gaining weight
sorry there are no doctors here who can prescribe for you. if you have a bad sinus infection try to get to urgent care at the very least because you need to know what kind of infection you have and they can get you the right antibiotics for it. i've beat more than a few sinus infections with lots of hot showers decongestant nasal spray to let the sinuses drain sometimes even sinus rinses and lots of hot soup with garlic. it's something of a natural antibiotic.

most helpful answer sorry to hear you went through that. it sounds awful! this definitely could have been a case of food poisoning. many packaged meats (including those from a deli) contain quite a few preservatives but the meat still could have gone bad after nine days. abdominal cramps diarrhea nausea chills fever headache and weakness all can be signs of food poisoning. the exact symptoms relate to the type of germ causing the food poisoning. also symptoms from the most common types of food poisoning usually start within 2 to 6 hours of consuming the contaminated food so your symtpoms match up with that timeframe. except for infants children the elderly pregnant women or those with compromised immune systems most people don't require treatment for food poisoning. it should go away on its own within a couple of days. the best thing to do is drink plenty of water and allow the diarrhea to flow. you want to let those bad germs get out of your body. if the diarrhea continues for more than three days it may be time to try an over-the-counter anti-diarrhea medication or consult a health care provider. i hope you're feeling better by now! you probably won't want any corned beef for awhile.

here are some tips that can help to decrease the symptoms of gastroparesis: eating several small meals each day rather than three larger meals. the less amount of food eaten at one sitting can help the stomach to empty. eat meals that are low in fiber and fat. these kinds of foods slow down the emptying of the stomach. eat foods that are more liquid or low-residue (for example applesauce should replace whole apples with skins. ) you will want to talk with her doctor about any medication to help with emptying the stomach if needed. here is a helpful link about gastroparesis.

sorry to hear about this rash. how annoying! rashes are difficult to diagnose without a physical examination. it's certainly possible that too much sun exposure caused your rash but it seems odd it would only be on one side of the face. if your rash becomes painful and turns to blisters and if you've ever had chickenpox then you should be alert to the possibility this could be shingles. shingles is a bit unusual in someone your age but it's not unheard of. shingles can be contagious so if you develop the above symptoms i'd advise calling your primary care provider and letting him or her know about your rash so he or she can determine if you should come into the office. also if you develop those symptoms stay away from anyone who has not had chickenpox in order to avoid giving them the virus. chances are your rash is not serious and will clear up on its own. if it gets worse or doesn't clear up within a few days i'd suggest you visit your health care provider. good luck to you!

unfortunately you've missed the open enrollment period for signing up for health insurance for 2015. the next open enrollment period won't come around again until november of this year for health insurance that starts no sooner than january 2016. there is one possible exception however. if when you file your 2014 tax return you learn that you owe a penalty because you did not have insurance in 2014 you may qualify for a special enrollment period that lasts only until april 30th. the idea here is to help you avoid two years in a row of tax penalties for going uninsured. if you think you may eligible for this special enrollment you'll also be eligible for financial assistance as long as your income qualifies you. i suggest you go right away to healthcare. gov to see about signing up for health insurance.
boys stop growing at 20 years of age whereas girls stop growing around age 18 so there still is time. first make sure you are getting enough calories. this chart will give you an idea of how much you need based on your gender age and activity level. you also want to eat regular meals and in between snacks. aim for 4-5 food groups at main meals (lean protein fruit vegetable grain dairy and healthy fat) and 2-3 food groups in between meals. make sure you get adequate calcium and vitamin d for bone growth. you are at beak bone mass and need 1300mg calcium each day! most servings of dairy contain about 300mg (1 cup milk/yogurt and 1/5 ounce of cheese) so 3-4 daily servings helps you meet your needs. the american academy of pediatrics recommend children and adolescents take supplemental vitamin d if they can't get it through diet. remember vitamin d enhances calcium absorbtion. the recommended amount is 600iu but if you are low you may need more. you can also get blood work done to be sure. lastly adequate sleep is needed during times of growth so make sure you get to bed at a decent time at night. you may not be able to do anything about genetics but maximizing nutrition and taking care of yourself can only help you grow to your potential.
"systolic pressure is the pressure of the blood in the arteries when the heart pumps. it is the higher of two blood pressure measurements; for example, if the blood pressure is 120/80, then 120 is the systolic pressure."
"well it certainly could be a cyst. or it could be half a dozen other things i can think of off the top of my head. our skin is prone to developing many types of weird lumps and bumps. the good news is most of the time these go away on their own. sometimes they burst and emit fluid. other times they just seem to disappear. as long as you do not develop a fever or an angry hot red rash in the area it's probably ok to take a wait-and-see attitude with this bump at your bikini line. you can put some warm compresses on it to see if that helps ""draw out"" any exudate (gunk) from the cyst (or whatever it is). do not squeeze or puncture the bump in an attempt to drain it. that is a great way to get an infection. instead just monitor the lump. if it bursts on its own that's fine  put some antibiotic ointment on the wound (assuming you're not allergic to antibiotic ointment) and cover it with an adhesive bandage. do that for a couple of days or until the wound has finished draining. in the unlikely event you develop a fever an angry rash in the area or if the bump doesn't go away within a couple of weeks then get a medical professional to look at it. wishing you well!"
true influenza is respiratory not intestinal so i would be conerned that your mucous secretions would be related to an infection or inflammation in your colon. there can be many different reasons. yes you should be concerned. see your medical provider so that you can be properly diagnosed and treated.
hi instead of doing an mri get a knee arthoscopy done to visualise the lesion directly through camera. u may need a bone biopsy from the lesion to confirm the diagnosis. histopathology of the biopsied material should be done to come to a pinpoint conclusion. thanks

i have no way of blindly diagnosing the cause of your sore throat over the internet. this is going to take a hands-on examination and perhaps a strep test. because you are pregnant you must be carefully examined and treated with medications that are safe for you and your baby. this may be just a bad cold but you will need to see your medical provider to make sure you do not have something more serious going on.
sudafed is a decongestant; claritin is an antihistamine. they are not the same. antihistamines have some beneficial effect on certain types of vertigo; decongestants (like sudafed) would not likely help.
no. you cannot get genital herpes this way.
mobic can be taken safely with those two medications. there are no significant interactions between the medications you listed. mobic is an anti-inflammatory medication and does have a slight tendency to raise blood pressure when taken regularly. so it is important to watch your blood pressure while you are taking it. i am sure your doctor will be monitoring for that. also to avoid dangerous drug interactions it's always important to have all your prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy so the pharmacist has access to all the information he or she needs to take the best care of you. also new prescriptions will be screened against all the other medications you are taking to ensure there are no problems.
you can be irregular
yes. everytime im pregnant i don't know it because i'm always having my period. it happened twice
you are describing classic signs of anxiety. if you don't have any physical causes this sounds just like normal anxiety. the trick here is to tell yourself that no matter how uncomfortable these sensations are you can handle them. that way they will eventually pass. but anxiety can be really scary at times even if there's nothing physical going on.
i'm sorry you're going through this. it certainly sounds unpleasant. i suggest you get checked out by your gynecologist. several issues could cause the symptoms you're describing one of which is endometriosis. although it's thought of as a middle-aged women's condition endometriosis can occur in women of all ages. endometriosis occurs when the tissue that normally lines the uterine wall begins growing outside the uterus. typically this tissue attaches to other structures like the ovaries or the bowels. i'm not diagnosing you with endometriosis by any means. i just wanted to give one example of a condition that could cause symptoms similar to what you describe. an ovarian cyst is another possibility. and so i recommend you make a trip to the gynecologist. a physical exam coupled with some other testing can get you diagnosed and treated so you can stop having these uncomfortable symptoms. wishing you well!
coating your hair with oil silicone or dimethicone-based products can certainly help replace the shine that may be lost with excessive chemical processing. however it will only last until the next shampoo. the best way to repair the hair permanently is to allow it to grow in without using any harsh treatments.
"when you get infected, you typically start to show symptoms about 2 to 5 days after you were exposed to the bacteria."
normally there are several mechanisms to prevent acid from flowing backwards (refluxing) up into the esophagus. one mechanism involves a band of esophageal muscle where the esophagus joins the stomach called the lower esophageal sphincter that remains contracted most of the time to prevent acid from refluxing or regurgitating. the sphincter only relaxes when food is swallowed allowing food to pass from the esophagus and into the stomach. the sphincter normally is attached firmly to the diaphragm in the hiatus and the muscle of the diaphragm wraps around the sphincter. the muscle that wraps around the sphincter augments the pressure of the contracted sphincter to further prevent reflux of acid. another mechanism that prevents reflux is the valve-like tissue at the junction of the esophagus and stomach just below the sphincter. the esophagus normally enters the stomach tangentially so that there is a sharp angle between the esophagus and stomach. the thin piece of tissue in this angle composed of esophageal and stomach wall forms a valve that can close off the opening to the esophagus when pressure increases in the stomach for example during strenuous exercise. when a hiatal hernia is present two changes occur. first the sphincter slides up into the chest while the diaphragm remains in its normal location. as a result the pressure normally generated by the diaphragm overlying the sphincter and the pressure generated by the sphincter no longer overlap and as a result the total pressure at the gastro-esophageal junction decreases. second when the gastro-esophageal junction and stomach are pulled up into the chest with each swallow the sharp angle where the esophagus joins the stomach becomes less sharp and the valve-like effect is lost. both changes promote reflux of acid.
it is possible that you are pregnant but it could also have been a miscarriage. you should definitely go see your doctor. it is pretty uncommon to get a false positive on a pregnancy test. good luck to you
call your doctor if you notice any of the symptoms of pneumonia. in many instances you need immediate treatment to recover and avoid complications. in addition call your doctor if: your sharp chest pain does not get better with prescribed treatment; you have increased shortness of breath; or your fingernails toenails or skin becomes dark or develops a bluish tinge after diagnosis. this may mean that you are not getting enough oxygen into your blood and you need medical assistance. you cough up blood; you may need additional treatment for a worsening infection.
i have had both infections and only had itching with the yeast infection. any discharge? uti's or bladder infections feel more of an urgency to urinate and then you go and its just a few dribbles that causes discomfort. however maybe its in the hair lice etc. it will live in all hair and on surfaces. i'd have this checked out again and if your doctor still says everything is fine ask what you can do to alleviate the symptoms. good luck that feeling is awful as most women know at one time or another!
hi these seem to be enlarged lymph nodes which may be secondary to a recent cest infection. this wont affect your knee surgery directly but i would suggest you to get a cbc and lymph node biopsy to confirm the root cause. thanks

i see the survivor people on television do it all of the time and there are a few urine-drinking zealots out there who feel that the practice is somehow beneficial. personally i am not sure why anyone would do this unless they were in the desert or stranded in a lifeboat; dying of thrist. is it okay to do it? urine tends to be sterile and primarily water with some mineral sediment so it would not be harmful. just unusual. i heard from a natural doctor that it is even a healthy thing once in a while to drink your pee. [i'm just not sure why. ]
"rapidly fluctuating blood pressure may be seen with advancing pd. the pressure may elevate when a patient is in an ""off"" state and having less mobility. conversely the pressure may drop quite low during periods on better mobility - and dyskinesia. treatment of this problem is difficult but relies on a pd regimen that concentrates on medicine dosing for steady state dosing levels. discuss this strategy with your doctor - and remember to always get your blood pressure taking while sitting and standing in any doctor's office. if your blood pressure is elevated all the time it is not as likely to be related to pd and should be treated. however it may not take as much anti-hypertensive medications as with someone without pd. the anti-pd medicines all lower blood pressure."

"most of us have a sense of which eating and exercising habits (or lack thereof) have gotten us into trouble and stand in the way of our shedding pounds. it's staying motivated that's the hard part. but there may be help for you in unexpected places. how about a little help from. your employer? if you're not looking to your employee benefits or even your insurance company for help reaching your health goals you may be missing out. ""increasingly employers are providing incentives and offering programs to employees looking to take better control of their health "" says mike thompson a principal in pricewaterhousecoopers' health and welfare practice. this year the incentives to follow through on your weight loss plans among other health goals are greater than ever. here's just a taste of what's being offered to help you keep the weight off: weight watchers at work. onsite nutrition classes. healthier food offerings in the cafeteria and in vending machines. free or reduced membership costs for joining a gym. nurse coaches available by telephone to discuss health management. activity-related programs such as: making pedometers available (to record how many steps you take). web sites to record your level of physical activity in a given day. competitions among workers to get active. walking programs at lunch time. check your benefits package or talk with your human resources department about the types of wellness programs available to you at the office. and if you buy health benefits on your own call your insurance company to ask about weight-loss assistance. both employers and insurers are anxious to help you meet your health goals thompson says. take credit if losing weight and the health benefits that come with it aren't enough to keep the twinkies at bay focus on employer incentives which are richer than ever this year at many companies. employers are hoping that rewards for both action and results will encourage you to engage in healthy behaviors. a growing trend: if you not only enroll in a weight loss program but also make significant progress toward your goal benefits await you. according to thompson among the most common incentives being offered to employees to start and complete wellness programs are: reduced insurance premiums. gift cards. cash. in addition to paying less money for insurance employers will sometimes offer a more robust benefits package with lower co-payments and deductibles to employees who demonstrate a commitment to their health. ""why not take credit for it? "" thompson asks of those who plan to lose weight on their own anyhow. ""if you trend and track your progress you may get more credit than you even thought available.

"the symptoms of congestive heart failure vary among individuals according to the particular organ systems involved and depending on the degree to which the rest of the body has ""compensated"" for the heart muscle weakness. an early symptom of congestive heart failure is fatigue. while fatigue is a sensitive indicator of possible underlying congestive heart failure it is obviously a nonspecific symptom that may be caused by many other conditions. the person's ability to exercise may also diminish. patients may not even sense this decrease and they may subconsciously reduce their activities to accommodate this limitation. as the body becomes overloaded with fluid from congestive heart failure swelling (edema) of the ankles and legs or abdomen may be noticed. this can be referred to as ""right sided heart failure"" as failure of the right sided heart chambers to pump venous blood to the lungs to acquire oxygen results in buildup of this fluid in gravity-dependent areas such as in the legs. the most common cause of this is longstanding failure of the left heart which may lead to secondary failure of the right heart. right-sided heart failure can also be caused by severe lung disease (referred to as ""cor pulmonale"") or by intrinsic disease of the right heart muscle (less common) in addition fluid may accumulate in the lungs thereby causing shortness of breath particularly during exercise and when lying flat. in some instances patients are awakened at night gasping for air. some may be unable to sleep unless sitting upright. the extra fluid in the body may cause increased urination particularly at night. accumulation of fluid in the liver and intestines may cause nausea abdominal pain and decreased appetite."

i'm sorry you're going through this. i can certainly understand your wanting a more permanent solution to the problem after dealing with the support hose for five years. certainly there are surgical procedures to treat varicose veins. i'm not sure why your health care provider didn't recommend any of them when you were first diagnosed. after five years you may feel free to return to your provider and ask about more permanent options for your condition. there may be a very good reason why you weren't offered surgery to begin with. maybe it wasn't feasible for some reason. but surgical techniques change and patients change. maybe today you're a better candidate for surgery than you were five years ago. the only way to find out is to see a medical professional. you can start with your primary care provider or go directly to a physician who specializes in varicose vein treatments. hope this helps!

first try using a different formulation of each. generally creams are less drying to the skin than gels. if this does not help you may need to chose a lower strength formula or apply the creams less frequently. second be sure that there is not an ingredient in your current formulations  such as propylene glycol  that might make your skin more sensitive or irritated. examine the ingredients lists in whatever you're using and consult with your health care provider about undergoing skin tests to find this out.
mouth wounds heal fast and so viruses that require blood to blood contact aren't likely to get through the layer of scabbing. also viruses don't usually survive normal dishwashing.
"most helpful answer if your husband has known kidney stones and suddenly gets brown urine tis is most likely due to blood (older hydrolyzed blood; not the bright red blood seen in a fresh bleed). this could indicate the movement of a stone into the bladder or anywhere in the urinary tract including the kidney. stones cause inflammation and inflammation can result in bleeding. he needs to see his urologist again or at least have the urologist order a urinalysis. other causes of dark brown tea-like urine would be hepatitis but because of his stone history this would be highest on the list. so sorry to hear about the kidney stones and now this weird new symptom. it's always disconcerting when our body fluids change color! your husband should see his doctor as soon as possible. dark brown urine can be a sign of liver malfunction which could be caused by several things including medications. before you head for the doctor's office take note of the color and quality (firm loose etc. ) of your husband's stools. this information will help your doctor more quickly rule out possible causes for the brown urine. meanwhile your husband probaby should avoid consuming alcohol or acetaminophen (tylenol) just in case he's having an issue with his liver. if he has been prescribed a narcotic pain reliever such as oxycodone-apap he should weigh whether or not he can get along without it since ""apap"" is shorthand for acetaminophen. if you have any questions about whether any of his prescriptions contain acetaminophen you can speak to a pharmacist for clarification. i wish you all the best!"

there are lots of foods that are lower in sodium and also contain a good amount of fiber. a more structure meal plan called the dash diet (dietary approaches to stop hypertension) is a good place to start. the plan puts an emphasis on fruits and vegetables (all high in fiber) lean protein and dairy sources and whole grains (also have a lot of fiber). foods that contain a lot of sodium are processed foods cured smoked or pickled foods and pre-packaged foods. foods that contain a good amount of fiber include fruits and vegetables whole grains (whole wheat pasta brown rice whole wheat breads and cereals) and nuts and legumes. review this link for more information on the dash diet.
although home pregnancy tests are relatively accurate the blood test done at your doctor's office is more sensitive. it is unlikely that you are or were pregnant especially since you started your period. even if you had a very early miscarriage the blood test would most likely still be positive. at this point there is no way to know why the home pregnancy tests were positive. if you had your period for 3 days you're not pregnant.

hi here is a link from the uk's nhs covers stress incontinence perhaps a bit better than your doctor has told you.  just copy link into google to the www. to open and read. so you may be able to stop your urine but is it staying that way during the rest of the day so just get going on kegels and see if it helps but you must also do the reversed ones as well when you do these do make sure your bladder is empty. you do say you can stop your flow well that is a kegel so do that and hold for 5 seconds start off doing 10 at a time and slowly build them up till you doing 30 to forty and do 3 sets of 40 don't forget you can do these anywhere you like even standing in a cue now the reverse one you are going to put pressure down the other way as though your trying to empty your bladder a bit quicker and hold for 5 seconds but just google reverse kegels your see. ok good luck and do hope this helps you.

becoming educated about breast cancer and your care can be confusing especially with any doctors and other health care providers involved. here are some tips for keeping track: do not be afraid to ask your doctor nurse or other health care provider to repeat any instructions or medical terms that you don't understand. your providers should always be available to answer your questions and address your concerns. make use of resources and support services offered by your hospital and in the community. learning more about your disease will help you feel more comfortable with your treatment. ask your family and friends to help you sort through the information you receive. talk with other patients and families about breast cancer and its treatment.

the good news is this bump is on the skin. usually lumps on the skin aren't serious (in other words not like a breast cancer which usually resides deeper in the tissue). several things could cause a bump like you describe. it could be a boil for example. if so the good news is it can be drained treated and probably won't return. other than that i wouldn't want to speculate. you've done the right thing by scheduling a medical appointment. try not to feel too anxious. soon you'll know exactly what this thing is and then you can move forward with a treatment plan. feel better soon!
see your medical provider so you can have these painful lumps properly evaluated. not something that can be done blindly on-line.

"drug metabolism is the process by which the body breaks down medications. the liver plays a major role in metabolism especially a group of enzymes known as cytochrome p-450. drug interactions can occur when two or more drugs inhibit or induce a p-450 reaction and the drugs do not metabolize as quickly as they should. nicotine is a ""drug"" also and is known to induce the p-450 system. individuals with liver disease may also have insufficient levels of p-450 enzymes. the result is that drug levels can remain high in the bloodstream and cause more side effects. genetic factors also play a role in drug metabolism. the metabolic rate can vary significantly from person to person and drug dosages that work quickly and effectively in one individual may not work well for another or cause build-up and more side effects. infants and elderly patients have a reduced abilty to metabolize certain drugs so we often adjust their med dosage. but we find that people with fm [fibromyalgia] seem to act like ""geriatric patients"" in terms of sensitivity to meds and side effects (and metabolism? ) and often require lower doses than the ""normal"" non-fm adult. certain foods such as grapefruit juice and certain meds taken on an occasional basis can inactivate or lessen the metabolic activity of p-450s and can cause apparent fluctuations in response/tolerence to regular prescribed meds. we with fibro always seem to develop tolerances and intolerances to meds that we previously did well with which is frustrating to say the least. so there are different metabolism tolerance and intolerance factors that can cause us to have ""reactions"" to our meds. ."
you don't have to buy organic to provide your family healthy foods. buy fruits and vegetables in season when they are less expensive and actually taste best. turn to the humble diet heroes that are more affordable such as eggs beans and less expensive cuts of beef that are lower in fat and in price.
these tests are common in the third trimester of pregnancy: group b streptococcus screening : vaginal and rectal swabs are taken at 35 to 37 weeks of pregnancy to detect group b strep bacteria. although group b strep can be present in up to 30% of all healthy women it's the leading cause of life-threatening infections in newborns and can also cause mental retardation impaired vision and hearing loss. women who test positive are treated with antibiotics during delivery to protect the baby from contracting the infection at birth. as an alternative your physician or midwife may choose not to test for strep but to treat you in labor if certain risk factors develop. electronic fetal heart monitoring : electronic fetal heart monitoring is done during pregnancy labor and delivery to monitor the heart rate of the fetus. the fetal heart rate can indicate whether the fetus is doing well or is in trouble and can be done any time after 20 weeks. nonstress test : done weekly in many high-risk pregnancies such as women with twins diabetes or high blood pressure this test involves using a fetal monitor strapped across the mother's abdomen to measure the baby's heart rate as it moves. it's also used for monitoring overdue babies. contraction stress test : also done in high-risk pregnancies a fetal monitor measures the baby's heart rate in response to contractions stimulated either by oxytocin (pitocin) or nipple stimulation. doctors use the measurements to predict how well the baby will cope with the stress of labor. biophysical profile : combines a nonstress test with an ultrasound for a more accurate evaluation of the baby.

"some viral illnesses like this one are very difficult to prevent. once the child has been diagnosed with hfm disease they were likely contagious to the other children for days before. not all children who are exposed with get it and those that do may end up with this common viral illness a very mild case is likely and will not cause any serious harm. other than hand-washing and careful surveillance of children to look for infectious diseases there is little that can be done. those of us who work with children learn to accept that kids have a lower level of hygiene and spread disease easily and a lower level of natural immunity that makes them more vulnerable. it is what it is. if you love kids understand that these things just happen despite futile preventive efforts your grand-daughter will get her chance to start and spread her own infectious disease in the future; start her own mini-epidemic. and get even. these minor diseases though very inconvenient help her build a stronger immune system to fight off more dangerous diseases just like vaccines. the day-care does not charge extra for this ""service"". most viral disease are inevitable in grouped-care facilities no matter how careful and clean they are. we can sanitize tables and chairs but we can't sanitize kids."

the fine is either $95 per person/$285 for a family (not $984) or 1% of your annual household income whichever is greater. even if you haven't qualified for medicaid before you might now. the law expands the guidelines making it possible for a couple earning up to roughly $21 000 annually to get medicaid coverage. of course many states aren't expanding the program. if you live in one that is not you'll still want to shop on the marketplace for insurance because you'll likely qualify for a substantial subsidy to lower the cost of coverage. if medicaid isn't an option and you can't find a plan that costs you less than 8% of your income you won't be penalized for not having insurance.
that is a very difficult question on answer since i do not know the details of your molestation or if you had any physical injuries as a result. having been a sexual abuse forensic investigator for many years my experience has been that the greatest damage is psychological not permanent physical damage. just guessing i would say that you are most likely capable of getting pregnant. you can certainly see a gynecologist for a thorough examination to be sure.
sounds like it could be a yeast infection. there are now creams available over the counter to treat that.
hi first part of your question is yes. the second part getting pregnant no. that's why its at zero and zero means no spermatozoa. good luck

hi i suggest you treat chlamydia and get completely cured. then you can undergo monthly usg scans. if the scans turn out to be normal and if the baby growth seems normal without any anomalies then you can think of continuing pregnancy if you want. thanks
i guess anything can be abused. if a person is taking this much of a mucous-thinning agent perhaps it would be wise to consult a medical provider to see why this is assumed to be needed.

"if you suddenly lose a large volume of blood, you may be treated with fluids, a blood transfusion, oxygen, and possibly iron to help your body build new red blood cells. if your blood loss is on-going, your doctor will find out whats causing the bleeding, stop it, and, if needed, treat you for iron-deficiency anemia."
your daughter may have or be developing a urinary tract infection or perhaps some urethritis (irritation at the urinary opening). she should be drinking plenty of liquids and should see her medical provider as soon as possible for a urinalysis to determine if she has an infection.
i'm sorry to hear your mother-in-law is going through this but i'm glad she had glaucoma ruled out. severe eye pain should not be ignored. eye pain generally is not a symptom of age-related macular degeneration. i'd suggest your mother-in-law make an appointment to see an ophthalmologist (as distinct from an optometrist) to have this evaluated. an ophthalmologist is a medical doctor (md) who is specially trained to deal with high-level eye problems such as trauma glaucoma and other serious eye diseases. i wish you both all the best!
it is possible that the type of condom and any lubricant or liquid it contains can irritate the skin. discharge can be due to dryness or change in normal flora. make a mental note of the type of condom that you are using and speak to your local pharmacist or your ob-gyn about other options that may be less irritating.
"internal review: your first step is to request an internal review of the decision you want overturned by your health plan. your insurer should send you instructions explaining how to do this and the deadlines you'll have to meet. it must also send you a notice once it has reached a final decision and include an explanation of the outcome. here are some documents you'll want to start collecting in order to initiate the appeal: your insurance plan or group number and/or social security number your doctor's name and the bill for the services in question description of the service you want covered and why explanation of benefits (eob) forms copy of the health plan booklet section that describes coverage related to treatment copies of the medical records that relate to the service or treatment in question external review: if you're not satisfied with your insurance company's ruling you have the right to an external review which is conducted by an independent third party (often your state insurance department). your health plan should include information about how to file an external appeal in the notice it sends you. if you haven't gotten the information and get your insurance at work talk with your human resources department to ask for help. you can also contact the u. s. department of labor's employee benefits advisors (866-444-3272). your state's insurance commissioner's office is a great place to go for help too; many are setting up consumer assistance programs that work with consumers on health insurance appeals. for more detailed information about appeals processes under the law see "" your right to appeal "" on the nonprofit families usa website."
in my opinion you should check your cholesterol level and get a carotid. jagular duplex. it could be aggravated by stress but mainly there is something vascular in that area. if you are hypertensive it could be a carotid aneurysm or jagular narrowing due to atherosclerosis.
most helpful answer used properly and consistently condoms are a very reliable form of birth control but of course condoms are not perfect nor are the couples that often use them. based on what you have shared in your posting your chance of getting pregnant is very very slim. so relax. yes you should be on an additional form of birth control and yes you should still insist that your partner uses a condom. every time. for that extra added contraception protection and std protection.

this may be an advanced warning sign of parkinson's! if it continues through the next day or so you need to see a doctor. now that i've got you worked up it really might not be that bad. are you getting enough sleep? drinking a lot of coffee? these are the most common causes of shaky hands. lack of sleep may also contribute to anxiety. if this is not the case you may want to evaluate any prescription or recreational drugs that you use. i remember trying an maoi once and my hands got shaky i was sweating like mad and got really anxious. i was even on the lowest prescription dose! many chemicals interact with our nervous system and it all comes down to genetics. you may need to stop drinking entirely to get a full and correct evaluation.

according to your complaints past history investigations and present condition you might have ibs-c that is irritable bowel syndrome constipation type with differential diagnosis of intestinal motility disorder. the latter condition produces symptoms of intestinal obstruction very similar for which you required hospitalization. both antroduodenal and rectal manometry can be done only during endoscopy and colonoscopy respectively. and if your doctor has a suspicion for motility disorder he can take biopsy tissue from a particular part of intestine during this. you needed hospitalization because your symptoms your intestine movement were so worse and caused significant dilatation of intestines which itself hampers motility. this requires aggressive treatment to decompress intestine to prevent blood supply movement and integrity of the intestinal wall the probable causes:intestine dysmotility. differential diagnosis:primary motility disorder of intestine. treatment plan:supportive medications need to be continued. preventive measures:avoid constipation adequate amount of fluid intake and can try semi-solid or crushed diet during active symptoms. regarding follow up:for further information consult a medical gastroenterologist online. - 
there doesnt seem to be a definitive answer in regards to what time of day will provide the most weight loss benefit from exercise. for you the best time of day is going to be whatever helps you in establishing a consistent routine. it helps to make exercise as convenient and enjoyable as possible for yourself so that its easier for you to stay on track. i would suggest experimenting with doing exercise at different times of day to see what works best for you. are you enough of a morning person to commit to waking up early? early morning exercise is great but it may not be good for you if you end up sleep deprived or if youre prone to hitting the snooze button and end up skipping exercise sessions. is it possible to exercise during a lunch break for a mid-afternoon energy boost? what about after work or are you too tired from a long hard day of work and just want to relax? late-afternoon or early evening exercise works well for some but may be a challenge if you have other after-work obligations or commitments that might interfere. does exercising too late in the evening affect your sleep or cause you to have insomnia? ultimately the best time of day for you to exercise is going to be specific to what meets your needs and what works best with your schedule and lifestyle. the best thing to do is to find a time that helps to establish a consistent exercise routine. different people lives and schedules = different workout times. one thing i always make sure to do is exercise before i eat a meal. not after. sometimes i work out in the morning sometimes in the afternoon. this is largely based on my sleep/rest. as long as i get my own personal needs of eight hours of sleep a night i will get up and exercise early in the morning. my two big points here. are get enough rest and exercise if possible before eating meal or make sure to put something in your body after. i find the mornings before breakfast to be the best. here's what happens. you're exercising on an empty stomach so your blood has to pull energy from your fat reserves. then after exercising don't eat anything for at least 30 minutes. this allows your blood to stabilize to catch up to its normal state again from fat. this gives plenty of time to shower and otherwise get ready for work. then have a good breakfast. if you eat immediately after exercising your blood will replenish from that instead of your fat and you'll have less weight loss. and you've revved up your metabolizm to burn your breakfast instead of store it. i just wanted the answer to the question about the different time of day about a beneficial workout - could not seem to figure out where to get the answer - should it be this complicated? i myself walk for 30 minutes on my lunch hour before i eat my lunch. i used to when i was younger work out after work. i have heard that working out early morning is great i couldn't do it and before dinner now i'm too tired.
viral vaginitis is a form of vaginitis (infection or inflammation of the vagina) caused by viral infection. one form caused by the herpes simplex virus (hsv) is often just called herpes infection. these infections also are spread by sexual contact.
"most helpful answer well first let me say no one should take more than the recommended dose of any medication or supplement. there's usually a good reason why those limits were set. just because supplements are often labeled as ""natural"" or ""healthy"" doesn't mean you can't experience serious side effects by taking too much of any given product. that said i doubt taking a lot of probiotics would cause weight loss. probiotics replenish the ""good flora"" of the intestinal tract which probably has no effect on the uptake of nutrients but theoretically can prevent diarrhea caused by taking antibiotics possibly help prevent urinary tract infections and have a beneficial effect on colon inflammation. if your wife is experiencing unintended weight loss you are right to be concerned. only an examination by a medical professional can help her figure out what is causing the weight loss. i'd suggest she make an appointment with her primary health care provider to discuss the issue. best of luck to you both!"
hi seems more of a ibs. i suggest not to undergo gall bladder. after all the usg was normal with minimal sludge. this does not warrant gall bladder surgery. thanks
yes it can be due to food allergy. not all alergic reactions give breathing problems. in severe reactions one can get symptom of breathlessness. be cautious next time while eating stuff that you are allergic to.
this might sound silly to you but this happens to my belly button pretty frequently and the best thing i've found for it is called boudreaux's butt paste it's a diaper rash cream that can be found in most grocery stores or walmarts. you just spread it on pretty thickly and wait over night and the pain and redness will have decreased and it'll be on it's way to healing. i repeat usage as needed boudreaux's butt paste is completely harmless so it can be used frequently. it has a pretty sweet scent but it's not unbearable and it certainly beats vinegar.
first of all i want to make sure that [everyone] knows about our new web site which is healthcare. gov which gives very specific information about plans available in the marketplace. after the first of october well have pricing information along with those plans. but for the first time ever weve pulled together all the information by zip code by age by health status of whats available in both the public market and the private market. and thats a really good tool to go to over [and] over and over again. i would say before you cancel anything and try to rebook you need to know what your company is going to do with your plan. a lot of companies are picking up these additional benefits. you need to price the alternative. but the good news is our actuaries have told us that the new benefits will likely only cost between one and two percent in terms of premium increases. and weve really called on insurance commissioners and others to take a careful look at high rates that are being charged by companies to make sure that they relate directly to health benefits that people are getting.
blockages in coronary arteries are caused by inflammation which results in damage to artery walls and accumulation of cholesterol plaque. we know that smoking eating unhealthy foods diabetes and being sedentary are some of the risk factors for developing heart disease - genetics and family history play a role too. it's important to focus on (1) what we can do to reduce our own personal risk and (2) incorporate medical treatment and lifestyle changes to prevent future events.
and kudos to this strong 92-year-old lady! the answer to your question is: it might not be a type of dementia at all. i'd suggest you have this lovely lady examined by a health care professional. several conditions could cause the symptoms you describe. one thing that comes to mind is a urinary tract infection (uti). in the elderly the symptoms of a uti can mimic those of dementia or alzheimer's disease. but uti is just among many medical possibilities for what this lady is experiencing. the only way to find out for sure is for her to get checked out by a doctor. best wishes to you both!
lobar or segmental atrophy of the liver have been considered as a complication of different benign and malignant disease of the liver and of the bile ducts and defined as complete or partial based on the extension and histological appearance  so i recommend doing full liver functions tests
hi have you done a pregnancy test? have you been to your doctor for tests? if not how do you know your pregnant then?
"yes you can get the flu shot and the shingles vaccine on the same day. that means two shots because you can't give them in the same shot. however the cdc does not recommend giving two ""live"" vaccines on the same day. that means the organisms are live but weakened. the nasal spray flu vaccine and the shingles vaccine are live. so you can't get those on the same day. in fact the recommendation is to wait 4 weeks in between. however there's no problem with the flu shot (the virus is dead) and the shingles vaccine on the same day."
thank you for your question on ehealthforum. com masturbation does not affect the growth. masturbation at younger age in some individuals can lead to a feeling of guilt. this feeling of guilt in some people can be a reason for dysfunctions involving erection and premature ejaculation. thank you.

check the trainers credentials. look at education (b. s. in exercise/health preferred) a national certification with the national commission for certifying agencies (ncca) referrals from trusted friends or colleagues reputation in the industry years of experience (five years or more is preferred). find someone who's willing to be flexible and open to meeting you where you are with your fitness levels. it depends what time of shape you are looking to get into. do you want to gain a lot of mass muscle? do you just want to get cut and defined? do you just want to be slender and fit? are you looking to perhaps train for a marathon or perhaps other endurance event? these are all key factors in deciding.
good for you for quitting smoking! that is a true achievement to be proud of. in terms of the persistent cough one year later: that is a good question and i would advise you to take it up with your primary care provider (physician nurse practitioner or physician assistant). several possible explanations for the coughing come to mind. first depending on how long you smoked you may have permanently damaged your lungs which results in their inability to clear mucus. although you're not coughing up any phlegm it could still be residing down there in your lungs and triggering a coughing response. second smoking damages more than just the lungs. again depending on how long (and how much) you smoked you may have damaged your heart muscle. if the heart cannot contract with enough force to move blood through the lungs properly it causes congestion to occur. this congestion can cause a dry hacking cough - especially when you're lying down. i think you definitely should see your health care provider for an exam. the cause of the cough may be highly treatable if caught in time. best wishes to you!
"the removal of pubic hair is not medically-beneficial in any way nor does it protect you from pubic lice. the removal of pubic hair is only a cosmetic fad. i don't know about the lice or stds but i know i feel cleaner by shaving. i also used to get a fair amount of yeast infections when i was younger and didn't shave. and i'm happy to say that in the 30 yrs since i've been shaving i haven't had even one infection. that tells me i've removed the moist warm ""habitat"" for some infections. and my ob-gyn agrees with me on that. plus everything is better all the way around. hi the doc says its a fad some fad i personally have been shaved for way over 50 years my wife since we were married in 1970. i do love the feeling of being clean so dose my wife. doctors in the uk see lots of clean shaven women but there not sure if they do this when they come in to be seen or there like it all the time. but i think your find there is a whole lot of us who are true smoothies and love being that way its just so nice to be clean. you have to remember there are a lot of people who do love to be that extra bit clean and shaving dose that and really good when it comes to sex. smoothies unit. good luck"

"viruses bacteria or (in rare cases) parasites or other organisms cause pneumonia. in most cases the specific organism (such as bacteria or virus) cannot be identified even with testing. when an organism is identified it is usually the bacteria streptococcus pneumoniae. many types of bacteria may cause pneumonia. pneumonia caused by mycoplasma pneumonia is sometimes mild and called ""walking pneumonia. "" viruses such as influenza a (the flu virus) and respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) can cause pneumonia. in people with impaired immune systems pneumonia may be caused by other organisms including some forms of fungi such as pneumocystis jiroveci (formally called pneumocystis carinii). this fungus frequently causes pneumonia in people who have aids. some doctors may suggest an hiv test if they think that pneumocystis jiroveci is causing the pneumonia. you may get pneumonia: after you breathe infected air particles into your lungs. after you breathe certain bacteria from your nose and throat into your lungs. this generally occurs during sleep. during or after a viral upper respiratory infection such as a cold or influenza (flu). as a complication of a viral illness such as measles or chickenpox. if you breathe large amounts of food gastric juices from the stomach or vomit into the lungs (aspiration pneumonia). this can happen when you have had a medical condition that affects your ability to swallow such as a seizure or stroke. a healthy person's nose and throat often contain bacteria or viruses that cause pneumonia. pneumonia can develop when these organisms spread to your lungs while your lungs are more likely to be infected such as during or soon after a cold or if you have a long-term (chronic) illness such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. you can get pneumonia in your daily life such as at school or work (community-associated pneumonia) or when you are in a hospital or nursing home (healthcare-associated pneumonia). treatment may differ in healthcare-associated pneumonia because bacteria causing the infection in hospitals may be different from those causing it in the community. this topic focuses on community-associated pneumonia. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

when caught within the first 48 to 72 hours the administration of anti-virals can help to weaken the virus. after that period of time using anti-virals is ineffective. at this point treating your symptoms of pain become the primary concern. not everyone develops post-herpetic neuralgia but there is no way of determining who will. keep yourself well-hydrated and eat a healthy diet keeping yourself as healthy as possible and try to manage your stress as you continue to heal.
unfortunately i do not know the medical details of this gunshot wound to comment specifically. some wounds are sutured and some are not. if the clinician knows that there are absolutely no foreign materials (pieces of cloth dirt bullet fragments etc. then it may be closed. if a wound is sutured with even the tiniest piece of foreign material it is highly likely to get infected so many surgeons will leave it open to drain. if a sutured wound becomes infected it may need to be opened. if the wound is in an area that is cosmetic (face neck etc. ) then it should be closed. antibiotics are often appropriate since wound infections will complicate healing. i am not sure what type of specialist that is being seen now but since they have the ability to examine the person they are the ones who can best comment on the quality of care.
i do not believe so i think you are having a independent problem in your spine may be related to the cause that yoy have done for it laminectomyplease tell me why you primarily do laminectomy what causes you spinal stenosis. and if any investigations were done back then
i suspect you have seen those television ads that promise compensation for male gynecomastia (enlarged breasts) due to an association with respirdal. i see this common problem in pubescent many times per month and none of them are taking respirdal. granted i only have a few patients on this drug and none of the boys have breast tissue. if there is a link as the lawyer group claims i sure have not seen it. i would seriously doubt that your son would have this problem surface seven years after taking this drug for only thirty days. he should see his medical provider nonetheless to be properly examined.
"unless a star rose in the east your little cousin is not telling the whole truth. if that ""messing around"" included any penetration or ejaculation it was certainly sufficient to cause of a pregnancy. unless she inserted a turkey basting device filled with sperm or secretly had in vitro she is lying or certainly in serious denial. ask her how else sperm may have made it into her vagina up her fallopian tubes and greeted a waiting egg? sperm does not walk across the carpet swim up a leg circumvent the underwear and seek out an egg all by itself. let her tell her story. you know it is a bunch of baloney but now that she has a baby it would be better to focus on this new little life than that little lie."
based on the information that you have shared it would be advisable for you to see a medical provider so that you can be properly examined and diagnosed. not something that can be blindly accomplished over the internet. you may need some diagnostic tests if your medical provider feels they are necessary based on his/her hands-on examination.
that is a safe dose but you may not be taking enough. the maximum dose of ibuprofen is really 3200 mg and you are taking 400 mg. since i don't know your medical history or your weight so you can address you dosage with your doctor. medically you may be able to increase your dose to 600 mg each time; up to 3 or 4 times per day if your arthritis warrants it.
you would have to see a neurologist just to know if you had any diazepam-related brain damage. i do not know the details of your medication use. if you are having any neurological issues that you attribute to brain damage it may not be related at all to your past use of this medication. some parts of the brain recover nicely; other parts do not so it would be impossible for any medical provider to blindly delve into your case to such details over the internet.
hopefully when you take zantac or pepcid over-the-counter type of h2 blockers you should feel some relief within 30 minutes to an hour. so once again if you don't feel like it's helping then you could also take possibly an antacid like a maalox or tums or mylanta that would be okay. but if you find that that's still not helping in some cases you may need to be referred to a physician or a healthcare provider to have it looked at further. you can try one and of course the antacid may have a quicker effect because of the fact that its a liquid. so it doesn't take as long to dissolve as compared to the tablet.
hi these are enlarged axillary lymph nodes. it usually occurs secondary to any prior chest infection. if its painful then it may develop into an abscess. start taking antibiotics and anti inflammatory tablets. apply ice packs. do not massage thanks
hi you are absolutely right. only xrays do not rule out all the pathologies as they show only bones. getting an mri of the affected area will help to rule out lesions like spondylosis or slipped disc. you should see a orthopedist for further treatment. thanks
joint injections for knee oa (osteoarthritis) may be an alternative for people who dont find relief from oral medications or arent able to take them. joint injections are given at your doctors office. first your doctor may take fluid out of your knee with a needle and then inject one of the following: corticosteroids. these medications are related to cortisone a hormone your body makes to fight inflammation. injecting corticosteroids directly into affected knee joints can quickly and effectively reduce pain and inflammation. the relief can last from several weeks to several months. hyaluronic acid. these injections are designed to help boost the hyaluronic acid found naturally in your joints which keep them moving smoothly. in people with osteoarthritis the hyaluronic acid gets thinner and less slippery. several hyaluronic acid products are approved for treating osteoarthritis of the knee. they may ease pain for months to a year sometimes longer.
"to get the best answer to your question i'd suggest picking up the phone and discussing your concerns with your health care provider. he or she will be happy to explain the rationale behind leaving you on spironolactone while discontinuing the other drugs. my hunch is that your provider feared your potassium might dip too low after withdrawing the hctz (hydrochlorothiazide) which can strip potassium from your system. by leaving you on a ""potassium-sparing"" diuretic (water pill) like spironolactone perhaps your provider thinks your potassium will level out. however that's just a guess. obviously i can't read your provider's mind. as i said your best bet is to ask your provider directly. wishing you all the best!"
if there is no infection in kidneys or urethera then get a urine culture usually it is due to benign cause like certain foods as onions and garlic. increase the vegetables with your meals. increase the fish and decrease the chicken and harsher meats and definitely no burgers or processed meat. drink more water to flush whatevers in your system. do some light exercise in the morning and squeeze some lemon in hot water for tea to give your system a boost.

there are indeed a variety of vitamins in any flavor of vitamin water. but it seems the benefits of vitamins are offset by the effects of sugar. there are 13 grams of sugar in one serving so an entire bottle contains about 32. 5 grams of sugar. in addition vitamin water contains between 100 to 125 calories. in comparison a can of coke has 140 calories. the best thing to do is to drink regular water and get vitamins from a good source of fruits and vegetables. if you can't change your diet because of medical reasons convenience or availability a wide range of vitamin supplements are available in pill or liquid form.
fever refers to an elevation in body temperature. technically any body temperature above the normal oral measurement of 98. 6 f (37 c) or the normal rectal temperature of 99 f (37. 2 c) is considered to be elevated. however these are averages and one's normal body temperature may actually be 1 f (0. 6 c) or more above or below the average of 98. 6 f. body temperature can also vary up to 1 f (0. 6 c) throughout the day. fever is not considered medically significant until body temperature is above 100. 4 f (38 c). anything above normal but below 100. 4 f (38 c) is considered a low-grade fever. fever serves as one of the body's natural defenses against bacteria and viruses which cannot live at a higher temperature. for that reason low fevers should normally go untreated unless accompanied by troubling symptoms. also the body's defense mechanisms seem to work more efficiently at a higher temperature. fever is just one part of an illness many times no more important than the presence of other symptoms such as cough sore throat fatigue joint pains or aches chills nausea etc. fevers of 104 f (40 c) or higher demand immediate home treatment and subsequent medical attention as they can result in delirium and convulsions particularly in infants and children. fever should not be confused with hyperthermia which is a defect in your body's response to heat (thermoregulation) which can also raise the body temperature. this is usually caused by external sources such as being in a hot environment.
i would suggest you contact your doctor's office to discuss your financial situation and the fact that losing access to your prescription is causing you physical discomfort. most doctors are willing to work out some financial arrangement with you. if a regular doctor's visit in't possible try some lower cost alternatives. you can visit a retail clinic such as those available at cvs pharmacies. if you're in pain you might want to visit an urgent care clinic. and there are even online doctor visits available for a flat rate of $40 through services such as doctor on demand. doctors will conduct an evaluation via computer or mobile app and are able to write you a prescription.

benadryl is not a nasal decongestant and will do nothing for the stuffy nose (not to mention this medication should not be given to a child this young. ) you want to use saline drops to help thin out the mucus in the nose and then use a nasal aspirator to help clear the passageway. i also recommend running a vaporizer in the baby's bedroom  that usually helps a lot as well for congestion. parents need to be very careful about cough and cold medications in infants and children so take the time to talk to your pharmacist.
"your doctor may advise you not to have intercourse if you have any of the following types of high-risk pregnancy: risk of miscarriage or history of past miscarriages. risk of preterm labor (contractions before 37 weeks of pregnancy) which puts you at risk of delivering a premature baby. vaginal bleeding discharge or cramping without a known cause. ruptured membranes and leakage of fluid from the amniotic sac. incompetent cervix (a damaged cervix that has opened too early in pregnancy). placenta previa (the placenta is positioned abnormally low in the uterus near the cervix). twins triplets or other ""multiples. "" keep in mind if your doctor says ""no sex "" that may include anything that causes sexual arousal and orgasm. for example nipple stimulation and oral sex would be off limits."

fever is the bodys natural response to fighting off infection or inflammation. fever is most prevalent as a response in the younger crowd. the older we get the less often we get fevers to help us get better. fever is good and should not be feared no matter what grandma told you or what you have heard. fever is just a sign not a disease. school authorities will exclude children since they have no idea what the child is biologically cooking. if children have a contagious illness the fever stage â those first few days of an illness â would be time when they are most contagious. with that said exposure to an infectious disease like a common cold or even strep does not necessarily imply that the person exposed will get it. many schools and day care facilities require that a child be fever-free for 24 hours before coming back to the herd. this is probably a reasonable parameter but 24 hours after getting back into that classroom the child can get another viral infection and the dance will continue. there are no rules that a child with one viral infection cant get another. many kids especially those new to school or day care will seem to have one continuous cold lasting months. in reality they have had many overlapping (coalescing) viral infections during this period â a new cold starting before the first one went away. some fever facts:  kids will be excluded from school or day care with fever. period. schools set their own rules whether we necessarily agree with them or not.  fever in kids will cost you a lot of missed days at work. period.  fever is the bodys normal response to fighting off an illness â a good thing. it does not require treatment unless the child is uncomfortable.  lowering body temperature does not shorten the course of an illness; if anything it may prolong it.  fevers that occur early in a viral illness are expected and should be welcomed. fevers later in an illness may be a sign of a secondary infection.  keep your cool. fever is a sign not a disease. statistically fevers in kids indicate a viral infection; but not always. your medical provider is your best resource to determine the significance and reason for a fever.
nothing really. a ganglion cyst can bleed a bit when a medical professional tries to drain it or the cyst could have been traumatized a bit prior where blood leaked into the cystic sac. aspirated cysts tend to come back so it would be best to see a hand surgeon and have this cyst permanently removed.

"cataracts may remain small and may not be noticeable. they often do not seriously affect vision. and many cataracts do not need to be removed. some cataracts grow larger or denser over time causing severe vision changes. severe cataracts can cause loss of independence for older adults as decreased vision may affect driving working reading or hobbies. while cataracts can cause blindness this is rare. surgery is usually done before a cataract progresses far enough to cause blindness. a rare type of cataract can lead to glaucoma. as a cataract progresses more of the lens becomes cloudy. when the entire lens is white the cataract is called a ""ripe"" or ""mature"" cataract and causes severe vision problems. delaying surgery until cataracts are ripe or mature is neither recommended nor necessary. cataracts in children are rare but serious. if a cataract prevents light from entering a child's eye and stimulating the retina the area of the brain used for sight does not develop properly. usually the child won't see well with that eye ( amblyopia ) even if the cataract is later removed. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

your boyfriend may already have hpv so don't be afraid to tell him. honesty is the best and safest policy when involved in a sexual union. if he has had previous partners like you have he could have already been infected. if not from you from someone else. if you have hpv in your mouth or throat you could transmit it orally vaginally or even anally. it depends on where you have it. i know you have heard this before but the use of condoms will certainly limit the spread of hpv to your sexual partner. or any future partner.
we have several friends who are bipolar and they do not steal. there is no relationship to her stealing to the bipolar disorders. she just steals. more concerning would be a possible addiction to (narcotic) pain medication. hide your pills. keep them out of your medicine cabinet where she is likely snooping when using the bathroom. put the pain medication bottle in there (no pills) with some m&ms and note asking her to get some help. in the manic phase the person can tend to act impulsively/partake in unpremeditated risky behavior that they normally would not so therefore its possible that cheating and stealing are something that occur when she is in the manic swing of it. but it is no excuse to lie/cheat/steal. there are some people who are bipolar but would never cheat or steal but they would drive their car recklessly etc. call her doctor and express the things that are going on i am sure he/she would be a good help. bipolar disorder is about moods. lying cheating stealing is about their character. she has probably done it for so long that her bi polar disorder is a good excuse to get her out of tough situations like this one. no bi-polar disorder doesn't directly cause her to steal meds but the illness can cause her to not care that she is doing this activity. she needs to be under better care for her illness and taking her medication. so many people who suffer mental illnesses don't always take their medications. there are those who abuse even their own medications. she does need help. put your medications away!
hello since there is bacteria and you were sick there is a possibility that it could cause you a eye infection but it sounds like you took care of it and wiped your eye pretty well you should be okay but what you can do is flush your eye out with some warm water and pat it dry with a soft cotton towel or buy some eye drops and use those. if you do get some symptoms that are alarming to you like discharge or itchiness then schedule an appointment with your doctor to have it checked out just to be safe you do not want a eye infection.

the medications that you are taking do not interact with gemfibrozil. however if you are looking for a better schedule for taking your medications preventing any drug interactions i would separate out the nexium from the group. nexium can decrease the absorption of some vitamins and minerals more specifically the calcium. calcium is better absorbed in an acidic environment. take the nexium in the morning on an empty stomach by itself. later with breakfast take the multivitamin calcium vitamin d fish oil biotin and coq10 (at least 60 minutes later). diltzac and evista should be taken per frequency prescribed by your physician and may be taken with or without food.

it's probably a simple reaction between the water and your stomach acid. i can think of a number of chemical reactions that could cause you to experience gas after drinking water even though it's not terribly common for most people. at any rate you need to stay hydrated. you can try drinking water more slowly to see if it causes the same reaction. or you can try drinking water with some sort of sugarless flavoring added. or you can obtain hydration by eating fresh fruits such as berries and melons. if the problem continues to annoy you you might consider checking with your health care provider about it. hope this helps!

boils themselves are not contagious but the bacteria that cause boils are. boils are skin infections commonly caused by the bacteria in the family staphylococcus or by other bacteria. the bacteria manage to temporarily evade the bodys defenses and grow in a tightly defined area. small boils often go away without treatment. in some cases the skin infection may progress to become an abscess: a lump with a pocket of infected liquid (pus) inside. touching someones boil then your own skin wont necessarily cause a boil to form there. the process by which boils form is more complicated than that. the bacteria may spread to the new persons skin but never cause a boil. some people are more susceptible to boils and skin infections than others. one member of the staphylococcus family called mrsa (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) causes a large percentage of boils today. mrsa is spread from person to person in close contact. outbreaks of mrsa have occurred in dormitories military barracks athletic facilities and prisons  all places where people are in close contact. good personal hygiene is the most sensible approach to prevent the spread of bacteria that can cause skin infections. wash your hands with soap and water after touching a boil. a boil can be kept lightly covered with clean gauze. apply warm-water compresses to help your body clear the infection. if you have a persistent boil or feel you need to squeeze or lance a boil see a doctor. in my family it has been contagious just by walking into the infected persons home with never touching a thing and walking right back out and within 25-48 hours will have one so for us it has been airborn and recently when one gets a boul another gets mrsa well yes yes yes
the left upper abdomen is the location of the spleen and splenic enlargement is common with mono. if you were tested for strep (rapid strep test or culture) then your diagnosis was probably accurate but if the medical provider just looked at the throat and pronounced that you have strep then there is a 50% chance your original diagnosis was about as accurate as a coin toss. ask for a mono test (ebv panel) and get that abdomen properly examined.

no. this is not an adverse effect of concerta. black stools are often feared because they could indicate stomach bleeding but some foods (like spinach or black licorice) and some medications (pepto bismol) will also turn the stools black. since i don't know your medical history please consult your medical provider for patient-specific advice.
i know it's hard to justify when you get a new medication and it's expensive. but this medication might be the right medication and in the long run might actually save you money. this is a once-a-day medication it's used for depression. and if it helps you and it makes you feel better then that's a good price to pay. when you don't feel well with depression and you don't take these types of medications and you take some that have to be taken more frequently or might have more side-effects you forget to take them. therefore if there is a price on your quality of life and then also you are going to see the doctor more often which means that your overall healthcare costs are actually going up. so there are patient assistance programs available through the manufacturers patients may want to look into that as helping offset the cost of that medication. at the end of the day it might be the right fit.
heart failure in the left ventricle is the most common form of heart failure. left-sided heart failure is most often caused by high blood pressure or coronary artery disease. copd and left-sided heart failure are not directly related. however the two conditions may influence each other. for example low oxygen in the blood from copd may put excess strain on the heart worsening left-sided heart failure. excess fluid in the lungs from heart failure can make breathing even more difficult for someone with copd.

always put your baby on his back to sleep never on his side or tummy. theres a higher risk of sudden infant death syndrome if theyre on their tummy or their side; they can roll onto their stomach if theyre lying on their side. and be sure that childcare providers grandparents and so on know to put the baby on his back because theres also a higher risk of sids if a baby is usually put to sleep on his back but suddenly gets put to sleep on his tummy. finally be sure to give your baby a lot of tummy time when hes awake. tummy time helps promote physical development  generally babies dont roll or crawl as soon if they dont get tummy time for example. and if youre worried about sids you want them to have a stronger head and neck so they can [lift] their face up if it gets covered. also babies can actually end up with lopsided heads or bald spots from rubbing the back of their head on the mattress if they spend too much time on their back. these arent dangerous but if babies spend more time on their tummy itll relieve some of the friction and pressure.
you need to see an ent specialist. if an ent diagnosed you then perhaps see a different ent for a second opinion. there is really nothing that can be done blindly over the internet. you need to be examined properly diagnosed and your current treatment regime may need to be re-evaluated.

you can buy a plan through the marketplace but if your employer's plan is considered affordable you won't qualify for a tax credit to help pay for coverage. affordable is employer-based insurance that does not cost more than 9. 5% of your annual income and pays for 60% of the medical care covered by your health plan. generally employer-based insurance is a better deal than buying it on your own in large part because you don't pay taxes on those benefits.

many offices have policies that they can only give hiv results in person. you did not say you were tested but you should be tested. not once but several times over the next year just to be sure. if you had unprotected sex with someone who is hiv positive you were most likely exposed. it is not possible to determine individual risk based on this one (or more? ) sexual encounters so this is why you need to be tested a few times and start using condoms.

"i do not have an answer to this question however in 2007 we discovered the appendix does in fact have a medical purpose to redeposit beneficial bacteria in the intestines when needed (i. e. after a bout of diarrhea or when the immune system is compromised). there are currently studies to determine the correlation of appendectomies and crohn's disease. stating that we live in a clean enough environment to experience no problems without one is also a myth. birth control alcohol nicotine steroids junk food etc etc all create a heavy burden on our digestive system. don't quote me on this but i believe acne around the chin with red a red hue is a sign for digestive system problems and many toxins further exacerbate our intestines faster than they can keep up. it would be interesting to see if a connection is made to immune system diseases and having appendectomies however it would be the case of the chicken and the egg. was the body attacking the appendix first and then spread to other parts of the body or did having the appendectomy cause immune system diseases? was it poor nutrition or bad genes that caused such a problem? there is also medical purpose for tonsils as well as wisdom teeth as well as your frontal lobe. lastly i hear up to 28% of the time appendixes are removed prematurely. we at one point believed removing excessive amounts of blood would heal an illness. we also at one point blew nicotine smoke up a persons rectum. don't believe everything an ""expert"" tells you. it is a science because we know only a scratch. many illnesses are caused by behavioral trends of a society. source: due to this as well as my own adolescent idiocy i now have serious digestive system and brain issues and have spent hundreds and hundreds of hours researching how to heal myself through diet to no avail."
let her know that what she is afraid of is not the worst thing in the world. everyone gets sick and if you can get her to understand getting sick in front of everyone will not kill her and she wouldn't be the first she probably will not get sick. have her imagine what she is most afraid of and the most likely resposnse of those around her. chances are she has visions much worse than reality and can understand that.

fever is harmless. nothing to worry about if fever is the only symptom. this is just the child's natural way of fighting off an infection (usually a virus). however if there are other signs of an ear infection for instance you would need to see a medical provider so the child can be properly examined diagnosed and treated if necessary. if the child is uncomfortable it's okay to give the proper dose of ibuprofen or acetaminophen. treat the child. not necessarily this mild fever. i am guessing but i suspect this is your first child.

"most helpful answer the answer is: yes and no. some of your symptoms could be indicative of dehydation namely: dark colored urine extreme thirst itchy skin hard stools confusion but dehydration is not the only condition that could cause these symptoms. i hope you're following up with a medical professional about these symptoms to determine the underlying cause. regarding your ""hemoglobin"" results. i wonder if you're referring to the actual hemoglobin test or if you're referring to the "" hemoglobin a1c "" test. these are two entirely different things. basically a hemoglobin test measures your red blood cell count. a result of 6. 8 would be quite low for either a woman or a man. in fact that result would put you in the "" anemic "" category and it would require medical treatment. on the other hand a hemoglobin a1c test provides a snapshot of your blood sugar control over the preceding three months. a result of 6. 8 would be considered within the desirable range for someone with diabetes. it would be considered outside the normal range for someone without diagnosed diabetes. i would suggest you make an appointment with your primary care provider (pcp) to review your symptoms get a diagnosis and come up with a treatment plan. best to you!"
this is a great question because there is currently much debate about this issue. recent studies have shown that long-term use of ppis can lead to an increase in bone fracture risks in women. i would encourage you to have a discussion with your health care provider about the risks and benefits.
schisandra has the potential to interact with many different medications  either increasing or decreasing the medication's effects in the body. be very careful taking this with your medications and don't take it without first checking with your doctor. as with many supplements we don't have enough information to know what effects it may have particularly in someone on medications like humira and methotrexate. medscape. com (its a site for physicians) has a free drug interaction checker that is really helpful. here's a link:  i hope this helps.
so sorry your daughter is going through this. it must be miserable for her. i would suggest taking her to her pediatrician to rule out any physical cause for this vomiting. if she checks out ok physically then i would question whether she may be suffering from anxiety. anxiety in school children is not uncommon. and anxiety about going to school definitely could cause a child to vomit. you might talk with your daughter to see if she's being bullied or if she is nervous about school. if anxiety is the problem just talking may give her relief. you also might talk to the school counselor. this can be a good starting point. wishing you and your daughter all the best!

you could try non-weight bearing exercise like biking or swimming and low-impact exercises like the elliptical machine. if you work out at home you can purchase aerobic-training equipment like a bike or you could try some exercise videos. . also don't forget to do resistance exercise to build muscle. you lose muscle when you lose weight which can slow down your metabolic rate so you want to keep your muscle by doing resistance exercise. a trainer at your gym can design program for you. if you exercise at home you can check out exercise tubing for resistance exercise. tubing is inexpensive and versatile (you can do lots of exercises with them even in a chair) and a great way to get started with resistance exercise. you can start with a set of four for about $20. they come in colors to denote the tension. if you order them make sure to order the strap that allows you to attach the tube to a door and if you want to work your legs ask for leg straps. . you could also do exercises to strengthen your feet! the first one is to sit in a chair barefoot with the end of a towel under your toes and start to flex your toes to grab or pull the towel under your feet. you have to keep flexing your toes to pull it all the way under your feet. when you're done the entire towel should be under your feet. do a search for feet exercises and you'll get lots of ideas. .
hi your find that 126/65 is on the lower side of hbp found you this from avogel. co. uk high blood pressure may be a symptom of the menopause. however there is also debate as to whether hrt raises blood pressure. either way if you are or suspect you are suffering from high blood pressure it is worth speaking to your doctor to get to the root of the problem. your blood pressure is the force that your blood exerts on the walls of your arteries. high blood pressure rarely has obvious symptoms and therefore many people are unaware that they are suffering from it. however it is important to keep a check on your blood pressure level because it can develop into serious health conditions such as heart attacks or strokes. so have you been through the menopause yet? if not it could be your answer see your doctor a blood test will tell all form how your hormones are doing. hope this is it. good luck

"i don't know how much you weigh (that makes a difference in calculating weight loss) but i suggest that you just keep at it and only weigh yourself once a week so any ups and downs will not discourage you. there can be many factors: water retention (a quart of retained water weighs over two pounds) replacing fat with muscle or that you are weighing a different times of the day  sometimes with a full bladder or not having your ""daily constitution"" just yet. keep at it. if you continue to exercise and take in less calories than you body needs to maintain weight (15 calories per kilo of ""ideal"" body weight if you want to calculate it) you will lose weight. maybe not a fast as you would like but you will lose. the body loves to gain weight but isn't very cooperative letting it go."
oh thank you so much. i really appreciate this. i was worried but i'm okay now. thanks once again.

old remedy for constipation but a child that has just been released from the nicu should have patient-specific advice from the pediatrician not your mother grandmother or friends. it is not very likely that a two month old has true constipation (dry hard stools) but they can definitely have colic-like symptoms. kayro syrup will not fix this. just because an infant appears to be having problems having a bowel movement does not imply there is a problem that needs dietary modification. again get the advise directly from the pediatrician. someone who knows your child.

i'm sorry you're going through this. pain issues can negatively impact a person's quality of life and in your case you've had to reduce your running because of it. if it's been a year since you last saw the doctor about this it's time to go back. for one thing you now have additional symptoms in the knee and heel. for another thing even if the pain were confined to your hip the fact it has not gotten better over the course of a year means you deserve to have it re-checked. many conditions can cause the pains you've described. anything from sciatica to worn cartilage in the joints to arthritis could be the culprit. if you don't feel your doctor did an adequate job in diagnosing your condition feel free to get another opinion. i wish you all the best!

that's an interesting question. for those who aren't familiar with fatty liver disease it's a condition in which fat literally encases the liver and clogs it up. this can cause the liver to become inflamed or scarred. when it becomes scarred the liver cannot function properly. liver scarring cannot be reversed. if your fatty liver disease has not caused inflammation and scarring you stand a good chance of reversing it. here are a few things you can do: 1. stop drinking alcohol. although fatty liver disease is not the same as cirrhosis caused by alcoholism consuming alcohol can damage the liver. 2. lose weight. new research suggests a slow weight loss of up to 10% of your body weight can help reduce the amount of excess fat in your liver. 3. if you have diabetes make sure you control your sugars. diabetes can put you at higher risk of developing fatty liver disease. 4. eat healthy. it's that simple. wishing you well!

we don't know exactly what causes migraine but it's unlikely your situation would trigger one. further a migraine would not cause irritation to your eye. since an eye doctor has told you the eye is fine my own guess would be that the eyelash caused such severe irritation to your eyeball that the nerves there simply won't settle down. this is a not-uncommon event with nerves in all areas of the body. if this is indeed the cause of your ongoing sensation of eye irritation then the good news is it should calm down on its own eventually. in the meantime you could try using soothing saline drops frequently for awhile to keep the tissue nice and moist (as it should be). this may help the nerve endings settle down. wishing you well! many factors are responsible to trigger migraine. eye irritation itself alone cannot be considered to cause migraine and vice-a-versa. other factors like air pressure changes hot sun or bright or flashing lights can trigger migraine attacks.
flaky scalp not responding to noskurf (combination of climbazole piroctone olamine aminodermine and almond oil) lotion may be scalp psoriasis and need steroid plus salicylic acid 6 % combination lotion. the pain is due to hair root inflammation which is commonly seen in male pattern baldness. i would suggest you get the following test done. serum dht (dihydrotestosterone) level. thyroid profile. cbc (complete blood count). if dht is high then we have a specific treatment for that. both psoriasis and hair fall may increase due to stress. it is good that you are taking preventive steps. revert with more information to a dermatologist online

those birth control pills are most likely identical. the pharmacy may have acquired them from a different generic company and that is all they carry now. the pharmacist should explain that to you. you can contact your medical provider but i suspect that the pills are the same. different generic names but the same identical ingredients.
"have a medical consultation with an endocrinologist but taking extra estrogen will not automatically make you lose that extra hair (perhaps a genetic ""gift"" from your father) or make you less of a tom boy. if estrogen was the answer then all women on birth control pills (many of them with estrogen) or women on estrogen-replacement therapy would be girly as you put it. this is not the case. there could definitely be some genetic influence on your appearance so as long as your endocrinology consultation is normal you will need to be more accepting of who you are as being normal. not all girls (women) need to be ""girly""."
prostatitis is often described as an infection of the prostate. it can also be an inflammation with no sign of infection. just 5% to 10% of cases are caused by bacterial infection. it does not raise the risk of getting prostate cancer. prostatitis can affect men of all ages. according to the national institutes of health prostatitis may account for up to 25% of all office visits for complaints involving the genital and urinary systems from young and middle-aged men. in fact chronic prostatitis (which means it doesn't go away) is the number-one reason men under the age of 50 visit a urologist. in some cases chronic prostatitis follows an attack of acute prostatitis. chronic prostatitis may also be related to other urinary tract infections. the primary symptom of chronic infectious prostatitis is usually repeated bladder infections. prostatitis is considered chronic if it lasts more than three months.

"i want to discuss strategies for trying to enjoy sex and intimacy more despite fm. . many tell me the effect of fm on sex is the biggest problem in a relationship. call me old-fashioned but if your partner is willing to be open-minded and adapt to the ""fm you "" i think love gets stronger and conquers all. . open communication: this is the most important. often couples are not comfortable at first having converstions about sex. some find it embarrassing to speak freely. perhaps a good starting point is connecting on the fm. discuss fm and how it specifically interferes with your intimacy. reaffirm that avoiding sex does not equal rejecting the partner. progress the communication gradually and become more open in sharing each other's most intimate concerns and needs. specific solutions: identify specfic barriers to your unique situation and solve them if you can. if your main barrier is lack of libido/interest then determine if it's from fear of pain fatigue depression medicine side effects disinterest in your partner etc. don't just assume it's the ""fibro"" and nothing can be done. your specific barrier ""list"" can be treated step by step by adjusting/changing meds modifying routines etc. to remove libido-lowering factors. work with your health professionals of course. many times the process of simply recognizing the barriers and planning to address them results in a positive effect (placebo) and improves sexual mood. if pain during intercourse is a problem try to id the specific cause. . is it painful muscle spasms during sex? if so consider a pre-sex routine to relax muscles. sometimes your doctor can prescribe certain meds to relax muscles and decrease tension to take an hour before sexual activity i. e. a pre-emptive strike strategy. painful pressure? find positions with minimal pressure. if the problem is not pain but poor sexual organ responsiveness try lubricants stimulating creams/products natural products or talk with your doctor about prescribed sexual stimulant meds. i know these sound pretty basic and obvious but many times couples do not try the obvious due to uncertainty if it's ""ok"" to do something different. it's ok to do this. re-discover the romance: intimacy is not the same as having sex and it doesn't only happen in the bedroom; intimacy occurs throughout the day. couples can work on sending intimacy signals during the day: smiles compliments appreciative remarks soft hugs etc. try not to let fm stop these signals. couples can also take more time to get ready. yes i'm talking about foreplay! strive for natural and comfortable including a comfortable environment free from drafts. teach each other to rediscover touch with gentle stroking massage soft hugs kissing holding: no poking squeezing or playful slaps. discover new rituals: warm oil massage couple's hot tub hot bath or shower. sexual activities other than intercourse can be explored and enjoyed. find comfortable positions: we can figure this out. experiment with different positions to minimize distracting painful pressure. . find out what works for you and it's ok to redefine what is ""traditional"" for you. be comfortable together. professional counseling: sometimes this may be needed to work out ongoing concerns about sex and intimacy. you may wish to discuss this option with your fm doctor. ."

there can be several reasons: 1. your urine level of hydrocodone is so low that it is not detected by the lab. 2. the lab is not testing for hydrocodone on the drug screen (unlikely). 3. the lab results are in error or the method used for testing is not sensitive enough. 4. you are not taking any hydrocodone. rarely people are using fake wrongly filled or purposely-replaced medicines that do not contain what the bottle says. you would need to take one of your pills to a different pharmacy to identify the pills you are taking.
baby : your baby measures about 17 inches from head to toe and weighs about 3 pounds. baby is growing plumper and beginning to control its own body temperature. eyebrows and eyelashes are fully developed and hair on the head is getting thicker. head and body are now proportioned like a newborn's. hands are now fully formed and fingernails are growing. mom-to-be : your uterus is about four inches above your navel and it's hard to believe you still have about 10 weeks to go as baby continues to push on your ribs. you may be feeling more discomfort in your pelvis and abdomen. you'll probably be gaining about a pound a week. tip of the week : the membranes around the baby that contain the amniotic fluid are called the bag of waters. they usually do not break until just before the onset of labor but if it does break prematurely your risk of infection increases so call your practitioner immediately.
during the first trimester your body undergoes many changes. hormonal changes affect almost every organ system in your body. these changes can trigger symptoms even in the very first weeks of pregnancy. your period stopping is a clear sign that you are pregnant. other changes may include: extreme tiredness. tender swollen breasts. your nipples might also stick out. upset stomach with or without throwing up (morning sickness). cravings or distaste for certain foods. mood swings. constipation (trouble having bowel movements). need to pass urine more often. headache. heartburn. weight gain or loss. as your body changes you might need to make changes to your daily routine such as going to bed earlier or eating frequent small meals. fortunately most of these discomforts will go away as your pregnancy progresses. and some women might not feel any discomfort at all! if you have been pregnant before you might feel differently this time around. just as each woman is different so is each pregnancy.
chlamydia is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium chlamydia trachomatis. the infection spreads through vaginal. anal or oral sex and not by touching or sharing surfaces like toilet seats or baths. very rarely if body secretions of infected person come in immediate and direct contact with mucous membrane of other persons chlamydia may get transmitted. chlamydia can be effectively treated with antibiotics.
"your problem could be psychological or physical or perhaps even a bit of both. either way the erectile dysfunction can be easily rectified with several different medicines designed to increase (and maintain) blood flow engorgement to the penis. if you maintain your erection longer you will not likely have any related performance anxiety so the problem could fix itself with a little blue pill. you may not always need it but you may find this to be a temporary solution. these require a prescription so you will need to ask your medical provider. just one ""failure to perform"" could create a feeling that it will happen again so this is where the psychological component plays a role. assuming you do not have any underlying medical issues or psychological stresses affecting your life at the moment this should get you back in the saddle again. what can i do about it"

that's a great question and it all depends on how frequent your heartburn is. if you just have an occasional bout of heartburn for instance you ate a spicy meal then you can use a regular antacid a maalox or a mylanta product. you want to make sure though that you shake it really well; a lot of people forget about that. also too if you are taking medications you may need to space it; either take it an hour before you take your medications or two hours afterwards because it can actually bind to the medicine and therefore the medicine won't work as well. if you notice though that you have like two days in a row where you have had consistent heartburn then you may want to try a h2 blocker. pepcid is one consideration. zantac. you want to talk to your pharmacist though and let us know if you are taking any other medications. zantac has a tendency to interact with other medicines. so if you have your medication list handy we can take a look at it and make sure there is no potential for drug interactions. if it's two or more episodes a week that you are experiencing heartburn then you are going to want to go towards the proton pump inhibitor and prilosec otc is an example of that. you want to use it for 14 days but once again you want to talk to your pharmacist to make sure that you are not taking any other medicines or possibly taking any duplicate medicines that could do the same thing. then also if you are not feeling well after the 14 days a pharmacist is probably going to refer you back to your doctor or healthcare provider because it probably needs a little bit more evaluation.

"hello first a disclaimer: i am not a professional anything. just a sociology degree and anemia most of my life. has your woman friend been tested to explain her anemia? i was literally anemic for almost 50 years and when no one could find the reason they just gave up but being anemic really affected me. i finally found a hematologist who did a test that measured how much epo (the drug that cyclists were using illegally) which i believe is a hormone my kidneys produced. this was an ""ah ha"" moment because epo is what 'tells' the cells in our bone marrow to produce red blood cells. it turns out that my kidneys don't produce enough (lazy things. i ended up receiving shots of epo weekly. it certainly made me feel better. if she can't walk (ms right? ) can a physical therapist(pt) come to your home and at least help her exercise her extremities? i know my wheelchair-bound neighbor has a pt come in a few times a week. speaking from experience it's so difficult to get someone to exercise. no type of encouragement seems to work. i imagine she isn't feeling very 'happy' to be blunt. i imagine you have already contacted the doc about her 'fade-outs' 'heart beat' etc. my heart beat used to get very very slow and my head would drop to the desk as if i had fainted. do you suppose there is a connection between her heart and her symptoms? good luck to you and your friend. lastly i so hope you have a doctor who cares. a really good doctor who displays their compassion and concern can make all the difference."

there are several types of gallstones and each type has a different cause. cholesterol gallstones cholesterol gallstones are made primarily of cholesterol. they are the most common type of gallstone comprising 80% of gallstones in individuals from europe and the americas. cholesterol is one of the substances that liver cells secrete into bile. (secretion of cholesterol into bile is an important way in which the liver eliminates excess cholesterol from the body). in order for bile to carry cholesterol the cholesterol must be dissolved in the bile. cholesterol is a fat however and bile is an aqueous or watery solution; fats do not dissolve in watery solutions. in order to make the cholesterol dissolve in bile the liver also secretes two detergents  bile acids and lecithin  into the bile. these detergents just like dishwashing detergents dissolve the fatty cholesterol so that it can be carried by bile through the ducts. if the liver secretes too much cholesterol for the amount of bile acids and lecithin it secretes some of the cholesterol does not dissolve. similarly if the liver does not secrete enough bile acids and lecithin some of the cholesterol also does not dissolve. in either case the undissolved cholesterol sticks together and forms particles of cholesterol that grow in size and eventually form larger gallstones. there are two other processes that promote the formation of cholesterol gallstones though neither process is able to cause cholesterol gallstones by itself. the first is abnormally rapid formation and growth of cholesterol particles into gallstones. thus with the same concentrations of cholesterol bile acids and lecithin in their bile patients with gallstones form particles of cholesterol more rapidly than individuals without gallstones. the second process that promotes the formation and growth of gallstones is reduced contraction and emptying of the gallbladder that allows bile to sit in the gallbladder longer so that there is more time for cholesterol particles to form and grow. pigment gallstones pigment gallstones are the second most common type of gallstone. although pigment gallstones comprise only 15% of gallstones in individuals from europe and the americas they are more common than cholesterol gallstones in southeast asia. there are two types of pigment gallstones 1) black pigment gallstones and 2) brown pigment gallstones. pigment is a waste product formed from hemoglobin the oxygen-carrying chemical in red blood cells. the hemoglobin from old red blood cells that are being destroyed is changed into a chemical called bilirubin and released into the blood. bilirubin is removed from the blood by the liver. the liver modifies the bilirubin and secretes the modified bilirubin or into bile. black pigment gallstones: if there is too much bilirubin in bile the bilirubin combines with other constituents in bile for example calcium to form pigment (so-called because it is dark brown in color). pigment dissolves poorly in bile and like cholesterol it sticks together and forms particles that grow in size and eventually form gallstones. the pigment gallstones that form in this manner are called black pigment gallstones because they are black and hard. brown pigment gallstones: if there is reduced contraction of the gallbladder or obstruction to the flow of bile through the ducts bacteria may ascend from the duodenum into the bile ducts and gallbladder. the bacteria alter the bilirubin in the ducts and gallbladder and the altered bilirubin then combines with calcium to form pigment. the pigment then combines with fats in bile (cholesterol and fatty acids from lecithin) to form particles that grow into gallstones. this type of gallstone is called a brown pigment gallstone because it is more brown than black. it also is softer than black pigment gallstones. other types of gallstones. other types of gallstones are rare. perhaps the most interesting type of gallstone is the gallstone that forms in patients taking the antibiotic ceftriaxone (rocephin). ceftriaxone is unusual in that it is eliminated from the body in bile in high concentrations. it combines with calcium in bile and becomes insoluble. like cholesterol and pigment the insoluble ceftriaxone and calcium form particles that grow into gallstones. most of these gallstones disappear once the antibiotic is stopped but they still may cause problems until they disappear. another rare type of gallstone is formed from calcium carbonate.

i'm sorry your bladder issue is disrupting your sleep. how annoying! since you're already taking an appropriate medication i suggest you have a chat with your health care provider to see if the dosage is right. or maybe you need a different medication for the overactive bladder. one thing you can do is stop drinking fluids close to bedtime. i realize oxybutynin can cause dry mouth and other unpleasant side effects but cutting of liquids within a couple of hours of bedtime might help you avoid waking up at night. the best advice though is to discuss this nighttime urination problem with your health care provider to get personalized advice. best of luck to you!
a vaginal yeast infections is not treated with an antibiotic so you may need to re-post your question and mention the name of this antibiotic you are taking how you were diagnosed and a bit more information about this infection. are you taking diflucan? yeast infections typically itch and cause a white cheesy discharge. they are treated with an antifungal medication either orally or vaginally or both. wear loose underwear or go without undies at night so you can expose this area to more ventilation. if you have not been prescribed a topical antifungal cream like monistat you can buy this over-the-counter and add some 1% hydrocortisone cream to reduce the inflammation and itching.

there is no doubt that ecstasy has a strong effect on nerves releasing excess levels of nerve chemicals (called neurotransmitters). in fact studies in animals have shown prolonged nerve damage after using mdma  showing effects even 6 to 7 years later. it's safe to assume that it's not healthy for your nerves and could be worsening any nerve damage you have. in addition ecstasy has plenty of dangerous side effects  it can even be deadly. mdma commonly causes confusion depression sleep problems drug cravings and severe anxiety. i would highly recommend not using ecstasy or any other drug. if you need help stopping since the drug can be addictive for some people talk to your doctor or a therapist about getting some help. the long-term effects of using ecstasy (mdma) far out-weigh any temporary relief an individual may gain. for example individuals may experience an increased heart rate and blood pressure chills and sweating nausea dizziness anxiety agitation depress and sadness. one of the more dangerous side effects from mdma use is dehydration. the drug can interfere with the bodys natural thermostat and prevent it from cooling internally and as a result the body can overheat. this dangerous side effect has led to cases of hyperthermia caused kidney and heart damage heart attack seizures and may be fatal. gallus detox centers is an inpatient medical detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929.
i just turned 60 and am now 7 years post emergency bypass surgery. if you are perfectly comfortable playing squash with your heart rate that high not out of breath not breathing hard or panting no chest pain then you simply have fantastic fitness. its a whole body activity utilizing legs and tush as you move about the floor and back and ab muscles as you lean in all directions to move for the ball and start and stop. just be sure you eat a very healthy diet plenty of anti-oxidant rich foods every day and keep a lid on saturated fats in the diet. with a bad diet your heart can develop an alternative capillary network that feeds it as major arteries become blocked from bad diet with good exercise. this does not happen to every one but i have this and i know of a fellow about 60 miles away who does also. he also recently had bypass surgery.
the impact of vitamin d on ovarian cancer has not been as well studied but it has been purported to have a protective effect. researchers at the channing laboratory (associated with harvard university) used data from four large studies to examine the effects of vitamin d on ovarian cancer. it was determined that blood levels of vitamin d did not directly impact cancer risk from any of the four genotypes. however a specific type of the vitamin d receptor gene was significantly tied to ovarian cancer risk.

"there are only a few things that can be done for middle ear effusion (fluid). 1. you can wait it out but after three months you need to see an ent. 2. decongestants nasal corticosteroids etc. have all been used with limited success. sometimes it helps. sometimes it doesn't. antibiotics are not usually helpful since this is more of ""plumbing and ventilation"" issue. not an infection. 3. an ent may need to surgical drain the fluid (tympanostomy) or suction and place tubes in your ears. i went scuba diving for 6 days in a row last week and got water behind my right eardrum. i kept hoping it would clear up but after 8 days it was as bad as ever and it would only clear momentary if i hung my head upside-down. with my head right side up the water rested against my eardrum and i couldn't hear much through that ear. after reading on the web about the structure of the ear i learned that the eustachian tube connects the ear to the nose and i realized that the water was going to have to exit that tube. now apparently that tube isn't there to drain liquid or it would have done so already; i bet it's just for air to flow through to equalize pressure probably thanks to our aquatic ape ancestors. whatever. it's the key and the only way to get flow though it is to take advantage of it's connection to the nose. i pinched my nose and blew hard until my ears popped. that's the same thing scuba divers do as they descend by the way. apparently i didn't do it often enough because some of that ocean water wound up on the wrong side of my eardrum and the only way it'd get there is if the pressure on the inside of my eardrum was lower than the pressure on the outside (where the ocean was). then i pinched my nose and sucked hard until my ears popped going the other direction. i was moving air in and out of my ears through the eustachian tube. after doing this about 10 times the water was gone and i can once again hear through my right ear. fluid in the ear is most annoying and can be damaging to your ear. i caution you though about the decision to have ""tubes"" put in the ear drum to drain this fluid. i had tubes in for about 2 years they fell out. i actually had the little tiny plastic rings. they are less tubes than just little rings of plastic. most often the ear drum heals itself after the tubes fall out mine did not. i now have very tiny holes in my ear drums this is a problem. i cannot swim in a lake for fear the water will enter into the ear and this water can carry many nasty little bugs viruses bacteria and so on. many lakes in my area end up at one time or another have to be closed to swimmers due to high bacteria counts e-coli is just one of the many things that can be found in lake water. you do not want this to fester in your ear. depending on the type of tube used scar tissue can be left behind and ear drum will not heal on it's own. so you need another surgery to attempt to have the ear drum heal. the first attempt and it is beyond me why they even do this one the surgeon roughs up the ear drum and then places a thin patch of some kind of material over the hole(s) and hope this will work. this is only 60% effective. but it's your only option. i don't like the odds but that's all i was offered. i did not sneeze nor blow my nose for two months. and i was diligent in this i did not want another surgery i wanted this to work. it did not work at all. so now if i want to pursue it i have to submit to another surgery more anesthesia. risk. and the surgeon doesn't like this one because it's ""very tiny surgery"" is what i was told. they have to stitch the hole closed and i would imagine it's a big pain in the you know where. so don't just jump into this surgery. especially if you are not having pain. i would try more medications give it some more time try decongestants or antihistamines to dry out the ear(s). another go with antibiotics which i know is a real pain in and of itself. but don't just jump into surgery especially if you want to be able to swim this summer. pools are a better choice because the water is chlorinated but chlorine can damage as well. you will need ear plugs to swim but that's not a 100% guarantee that water will not get into the ear. i was told to use cotton balls covered in vaseline petroleum jelly when bathing or when swimming. this is disgusting and it does not come out of your ear. so you walk around with vaseline in your ears. really think about it. when i was a little girl i had swimmers ear; water behind the ear. i went to the doctor and he told me to drop alcohol in my ear until i heard it 'fill up'. you do this by tilting you head to the opposite side that has the water and slowly drop alcohol in the ear until you hear it 'fill up'. then press a kleenex or clean cloth against that ear to restrict the exit flow of alcohol and slowly tilt your head toward the side that has the water and slowly release the alcohol from the ear. you will hear it chug chugging as it exits and the last bit of flow should feel warm; that is the trapped water. i have used this technique for years when swimming or anytime i think i have water behind my ear. it works beautifully. i have had this for a month and apart from a nasal steroid spray the doctor says it will go on it's own accord. i have tried holding my nose and blowing hard into your cheeks but you just have to keep trying. try drinking laying down as well. it's a miserable complaint."
i think a lot of it depends on how long you've been deficient and to what degree. it is well accepted that a lack of vitamin d increases the risk of osteomalcia (bone/muscle pain) osteopenia (lower than normal bone density) osteoporosis and bone fractures in adults. so in addition to working with your healthcare provider about getting your levels back up you may want to check your bone density to see if there's more you can do. most the symptoms of vitamin d deficiency are subtle or absent in the initial stages. low vitamin d levels have also been linked to the development of immune disorders heart disease and certain cancers but more research is needed to draw conclusions. the good news is you can correct your levels now to help keep you healthy for the years to come. for more on vitamin d read this article on webmd.
although it is extremely effective for preventing pregnancy vasectomy does not offer protection against hiv/aids or other sexually transmitted diseases. consequently it is important that vasectomized men continue to use condoms preferably latex which offer considerable protection against the spread of disease in any sexual encounter that carries the risk of contracting or transmitting infection.
boniva injection is a prescription medicine used to treat osteoporosis in women after menopause. ). boniva injection may reverse bone loss by stopping more loss of bone and increasing bone mass in most women who receive the injection even though they won't be able to see or feel a difference. boniva injection may help lower the chances of breaking bones (fractures). these effects continue as long as you receive boniva injection. it is important that you receive your boniva injection every three months for as long as your health care provider prescribes it. boniva injection can treat your osteoporosis only if you continue to receive treatment.

if your history as true and i have no doubt that you are being honest the most likely cause is a yeast infection. yeast loves warm dark moist places and your vagina fits the bill perfectly. yeast is notorious for causing extreme itching swelling redness and a discharge so do not hesitate to talk to your mother. in most cases your mother has experienced vaginal yeast infections herself and will be able to help you. there are many effective over-the-counter medications and even an oral pill that your medical provider can prescribe. this problem can be easily fixed so don't delay. it probably is a yeast infection but you need to tell your mom so she can get you medical attention. she is a woman so she will understand. by your history your symptoms fit a diagnosis of a vaginal yeast infection perfectly! this can be caused by change in detergent soaps or even the material of your underwear. this is something that must be treated and only gets worse with time. if you have recently taking antibiotics they can also cause this. talk with your mother cause my guess is she has experienced this herself.
i had injections 6 days ago in low spine. woke this morning with bad muscle cramps in my thighs and caves. later in the day i even was having cramps in my shoulders. i also had a headache in the top of my head that lasted most of the day. i do not know if it is the medicine or the fluid loss from the shots. it is nice seeing my ankles look normal again; the steroids did that but maybe i lost too much fluid.
no most antibiotics they give for strep are: ammoxicilian ammoxicilian clavulanate(augmentin brand name) cephalexin or (keflex brand name). never heard of the drug you are speaking of. i know you don't have insurance but think of your health i recently thought i was having an ear infection so went to doctor but did not want to pay high medical bill so went to clinic inside walgreens and turns out it was only a skin infection of the outer ear. was given cephalexin for 10 days since i can only take liquid meds have troubles taking pills. i have insurance and ended up only paying $20 for the visit and $5 for the meds. you should try take care clinic at walgreens or minute-clinic at cvs their prices seem to be very reasonable. without insurance my visit would have been only $89.

yes. it shows that you're capable of doing physical activity in which your heart rate and blood pressure go up. in a sense you're doing a stress test on your heart. if you tolerate that well and you feel good doing it it suggests good things about your overall level of fitness and therefore your risk of heart disease. sex can also be a sign of healthy relationships and social supports  it shows you have the opportunities frankly and that you're interested and engaged. i think sex is a barometer for overall health.
prenatal vitamins are very similar to multivitamins. the three elements that are most important for a prenatal vitamin are the amounts of folic acid iron and calcium. typically a prescription prenatal vitamin has more folic acid and/or iron than a nonprescription prenatal vitamin or a traditional multivitamin. it would not be dangerous for your daughters husband to take her prenatal vitamins by accident. depending on the product he may have consumed more of some daily vitamins and minerals than is necessary but as a one-time error this should not be harmful.
hi found this for you. excess estrogen. estrogen the power player in womens bodies is your friend when its appropriately balanced. it makes you feel energized helps stabilize your moods and contributes to a healthy sex drive. yet too much estrogen which can be caused by weight gain perimenopause or toxicity from exposure to endocrine disruptors (which are rampant in our food water and plastic products) can lead to thinning hair. during and after pregnancy for example estrogen levels peak and then dip causing sudden hair loss for many women. the best thing you can do is get a blood test done for a hormone check. do hope this helps you. good luck

arthritis of the knee is an inflammatory disorder of the knee joint that is often painful. arthritis has many causes. osteoarthritis (oa) is caused by degeneration of cartilage in the knee. in its extreme form the menisci (cartilage) will be completely eroded and the femur will rub on the tibia bone on bone. osteoarthritis causes a chronically painful knee that is often more painful with activity. treatment is aimed at pain control with over-the-counter pain relievers. anti-inflammatory medications either over-the-counter or by your doctor's prescription are also quite helpful. more severe oa can be treated with narcotic pain medicines or a knee joint replacement in which a synthetic joint replaces your knee joint.

"aw poor baby! you should be pretty safe using a product like baby powder or even plain cornstarch out of the box to treat this possible heat rash. if the rash doesn't clear up within the day you might keep an eye on it. it's likely nothing serious but it could be something along the lines of a fungal infection (similar to athlete's foot). be sure to gently cleanse the area with cool water and a mild soap. most important pat it dry thoroughly. (don't rub because it will hurt! ) as i'm sure you know it's not at all unusual for toddlers to develop weird skin rashes that sort of come and go. they're usually only problematic when they refuse to ""go "" or if the rash is accompanied by fever. in that case it's time to visit the doctor. wishing you and your granddaughter well!"
i am in the exact same boat as you. had tinnitus in left ear since 2001 (cause unknown)(no concerts no loud music and have been out of work since 1992 so no loud noises) i have had full mri's ct scans and all is normal. the ent can't figure. i am taking medicine for a seizure disorder but i've been on the same medicine since 1961 sounds like a school bell ringing 24 hrs. a day now the right ear is starting maybe something to ask: my father had tinnitus in both ears caused by an explosion in wwll heredity?

they say the odds are like 0. 1%. personally i lack faith in that since my oldest niece and my youngest son were conceived on birth control without missing any pills. but it is unlikely. but a condom is still important. birth control does not protect from stds. so unless you know for a fact that your partner is free of all stds its always best to use a condom.
the first thing to exclude is your husbands cause he could be the reason start with him. he must do semen analysis and detailed sexual history should be take remember do not be overstressed. best regards

"yes. protection. it is not enough symptoms to say that you are a suspect case of covid19; but, independently of this, if you have been in contact with a case, or you present persistent cough (with or without sputum), shortness of breath, wheezing, or you have a chronic disease like diabetes, hypertension, low immune system or cancer, should ask for medical attention. and use all the protection measures."
"eczema is genetically dry skin. there is no ""cure"" but there are effective treatments. first be sure that you are dealing with eczema (atopic dermatitis). see a dermatologist if you are not clear. the steps: 1. moisturization is the key so use a good skin moisturizer  one without perfumes  and sue it often. 2. avoid scratching at all costs since this can lead to secondary skin infection. antihistamines can be used fo control itching. 3. control inflammation. using hydrocortisone cream (available over the counter) will help. 4. keep the skin very clean. and cool. warm sweaters (especially wool) will drive eczema crazy. 5. be patient. controlling eczema takes time. do not hesitate to involve a dermatologist if your home management is not working."
"if it's viral there's absolutely nothing you can do about it and it's probably a virus called roseola; you simply just have to let your body fight the virus on its own until it eventually overcomes it. i personally had this virus before and it lasted up to three months. if it's anything fungal it would definitely be itchy therefore i would safely rule that possibility out. if it's a bug bite (seeing as how most bug bites become itchy and somewhat sensitive) it's unlikely to be a mosquito unless you're allergic to them and the bumps are massive in size; my guess is that you have been bitten up by a spider of some sort yet not a black widow or a brown recluse seeing as how the center ""dimple"" of the bump would become much darker in color  and they tend to spew out pus as well."
"call your doctor right away if you show any signs of infection, such as:"
i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. i'd be worried too. it's not possible to tell from the information you provided if your eye doctor believes the raw sore on your eye is due to the dry eyeball rubbing on the eyelid (in other words sort of like a rug burn) or is caused by something else entirely. usually small corneal abrasions (that is a spot on the surface of the eyball that has been scratched or rubbed) heal up within a couple of days. because yours has not i would suggest going back to the doctor for some follow-up care. corneal abrasions by themselves don't usually cause blindness. i would suggest you ask your doctor what the potential outcomes are for your particular situation. he or she is in the best position to tell you what to expect. i hope you feel better soon!
i don't know anything about you to blindly determine a specific cause not even your sex. if you are male and over the age of 50 it could be bph (benign prostatic hypertrophy). if you are a female one would need to consider a urinary tract infection or variety of urinary tract problems. and in either sex nocturia (the medical name for this condition) could be one of the signs of diabetes. on a more simple case you could be drinking too much in the evening and not completely emptying your bladder. see your medical provider. this is really the only way to determine a reason and hopefully find a solution.
hi though caused by variety of reasons headaches are commonly as a result of gastritis sinusitis migraines or scapl lesions. get ct/mri of brain with contrast to rule out the causes. antacids vitamin supplements and benadryl will help. thanks

if you are not practicing safe sex (using condoms) and your two partners have had sexual partners in the past you can most definitely get an std.
sure it's good to use one specifically for the penis like you suggest because the penis skin is so sensitive. i used to have dry flaky (really gross) skin on my junk but i've been using man1 man oil for a year or so and my guy looks unbelievable now. nice and smooth and it's no longer dry and nasty to look at (or touch). so yeah i recommend it.
women with pseudocyesis have many of the same symptoms as those who are actually pregnant including: stopping of menstrual period. swollen belly. enlarged and tender breasts changes in the nipples and possibly milk production. feeling of fetal movements. nausea and vomiting. weight gain. these symptoms can last for just a few weeks for nine months or even for several years. a very small percentage of patients with false pregnancy will arrive at the doctor's office or hospital with what feels like labor pains but they will not deliver a baby.

"hyperthyroidism is suggested by several signs and symptoms; however patients with mild disease usually experience no symptoms. in patients older than 70 years the typical signs and symptoms also may be absent. in general the symptoms become more obvious as the degree of hyperthyroidism increases. the symptoms usually are related to an increase in the metabolic rate of the body. common symptoms include: excessive sweating. heat intolerance. increased bowel movements. tremor (usually fine shaking). nervousness; agitation. rapid heart rate. weight loss. fatigue. decreased concentration. irregular and scant menstrual flow. in older patients irregular heart rhythms and heart failure can occur. in its most severe form untreated hyperthyroidism may result in ""thyroid storm "" a condition involving high blood pressure fever and heart failure. mental changes such as confusion and delirium also may occur."
many factors are responsible to trigger migraine. eye irritation itself alone cannot be considered to cause migraine and vice-a-versa. other factors like air pressure changes hot sun or bright or flashing lights can trigger migraine attacks.
the first step is an examination to determine the source of the blood. the most common cause of blood in the stools assuming it is bright red blood would be a fissure (a small tear) polyp or hemorrhoid. if the bleeding is from the vaginal area and examination will determine the source.
