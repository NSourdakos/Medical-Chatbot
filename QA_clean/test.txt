can you get too much oxygen,"it's difficult to answer your question without more information. when people have copd and use home oxygen therapy they often are told not to set the oxygen delivery rate above a certain number. this is very important. it's not exactly because a person can ""get too much oxygen "" but rather because breathing is not only a matter of taking in oxygen  it's also a matter of exhaling carbon dioxide. if a copd patient sets their oxygen delivery rate too high they risk upsetting the balance between taking oxygen in and breathing carbon dioxide out. if you retain carbon dioxide it can be harmful to your health. if you have any questions related to your personal oxygen needs or the oxygen requirements of a loved one don't hesitate to ask your primary health care provider or a respiratory therapist. these experts can help you understand how your lungs work whether or not you need oxygen therapy and much more. i hope this answers your question!",['oxygen'],wmd

is it safe to use nail polish while pregnant,phthalates which are found in many nail polishes have been studied for a potential risk of causing birth defects. however evidence does not currently suggest a connection between phthalates and birth defects in humans. but studies in animals have shown these substances interfere with male sexual development so caution may be warranted. to be on the safe side you can use phthalate-free nail polish. or polish your nails in a well-ventilated area to limit your exposure. once the polish dries there's little risk to your baby since chemicals aren't absorbed through the nails. here's a great article on pregnancy-proofing your beauty regimen. i personally avoided most nail polish when i was pregnant. the story below says to avoid polish with phthalates which have been linked to birth defects. look at the ingredients list on your polish to be sure. if you go to a salon and are not sure if they carry phthlate-free brands take your own. some brands said to be free of phthlates include essie revlon and l'oreal but remember to check the label as they come out with new types all the time. none of these links are definitely proven of course but why not play it safe until we know for sure? ,"['pregnancy', 'nail']",wmd

how long is mono contagious?,infectious mononucleosis or mono is caused by epstein-barr virus (ebv) a member of the herpes virus family. its spread during close physical contact mostly through transmission of saliva. (thats pretty close earning mono its nickname kissing disease. ) ninety percent to 95% of people in the u. s. eventually are infected by ebv although not all of them develop full-blown mononucleosis. people can transmit ebv to other people for six months or longer after recovering from mononucleosis. in studies many people continue to have ebv in their saliva for up to 18 months after symptoms of mono have resolved. thats why most people who get mononucleosis dont remember being around (or kissing) someone with mono. its also possible to periodically shed ebv virus in ones saliva throughout life without having symptoms. its not clear if people commonly transmit the virus during these periods. fever sore throat fatigue and swollen tonsils and lymph nodes are the usual symptoms of mono. the worst of the symptoms go away in one to two weeks but fatigue can last for months. vetsika ek. expert reviews in molecular medicine 2004; vol 6(23): pp 1-16. fafi-kremer s. journal of infectious disease 2005; vol 191(6): pp 985-989.,['mononucleosis'],wmd

what types of medications are available to treat nausea and vomiting?,drugs used to treat nausea and vomiting are called antiemetics. many types of antiemetics can decrease the severity of nausea although most require a medical evaluation and prescription. medicines available over-the-counter are mainly recommended for use in motion sickness and for cases of mild nausea. meclizine hydrochloride (bonine) is an antihistamine that is effective in the treatment of nausea vomiting and dizziness associated with motion sickness. unless recommended by a doctor it should not be taken by people with lung diseases glaucoma or those who have difficulty urinating due to an enlarged prostate. meclizine may cause drowsiness and should not be taken with other sedatives such as alcohol tranquilizers or sleeping pills. due to drowsiness people using meclizine should not drive or operate dangerous machinery. meclizine is not recommended in children under 12 or in pregnant or nursing women unless recommended by a doctor. dimenhydrinate (dramamine) also is an antihistamine. its use should be limited to motion sickness. it can cause drowsiness and should be avoided in the same situations as meclizine. several different formulations of dimenhydrinate are available including a children's liquid which should be used according to the directions under the direction of a doctor. dramamine less drowsy formula contains meclizine like bonine and may have fewer sedative side effects. both meclizine and dimenhydrinate are recommended to be taken about an hour before travel to prevent motion sickness. emetrol is an oral solution designed to soothe the stomach when nausea and vomiting are caused by a viral or bacterial infection or overeating. emetrol contains sugar and phosphoric acid. diabetes patients should not use emetrol without medical supervision because of the concentrated sugar. according to its manufacturer emetrol should not be taken for more than five doses in one hour without consulting a doctor. consult a doctor before using this medicine for pregnant or nursing women and young children. bismuth subsalicylate (pepto-bismol) is a product containing bismuth subsalicylate a chemical shown to be effective in relieving nausea and upset stomach. this remedy has a direct effect on the stomach lining and has no known serious side effects. it may cause darkening of the stool color and of the tongue. pregnant or nursing women should consult their doctors before using bismuth subsalicylate since part of the active ingredient (salicylate) is chemically similar to aspirin which may harm infants and the fetus. patients allergic to aspirin or related drugs also should not use bismuth subsalicylate. use under the direction of a doctor if you take anticoagulants (blood thinners) or have diabetes or gout because the salicylate may further promote the anticoagulant effect.,"['nausea', 'vomit', 'drug']",wmd

i have warts on my hands. will those wart remover products at the drugstore work?,wart remover products in the drugstore contain usually salicylic acid. i don't like the ones that have the freeze because it's not cold enough to really cause enough damage to kill the wart virus. and oftentimes it can leave a scar on the skin. so that would be done by your dermatologist using liquid nitrogen which is really really cold and will eliminate the skin where the wart virus lives and then the wart virus is gone. so it's important to note that wart virus is everywhere. anything you touch chances are you are being exposed to wart virus. so don't be so concerned about having it transmitted to somebody else if you shake hands that's not as much of a concern. it's more just to get rid of it because it's uncomfortable. also it doesn't go beyond the skin. so this is truly simply a condition of the skin. some people are more prone to it genetically than others and sometimes more at some ages than others. the treatments that contain salicylic acid work pretty well but they take time. another treatment that has great medical literature behind it that shows it works as well as the in-office treatments that we do as dermatologist is duct tape. so i think every house or apartment comes with duct tape. i haven't seen one house where it doesn't exist. i think it's just magically there when you buy a house it's just in your house. you cut it slightly bigger than the size of the wart and wash the skin dry it well and then put it on the skin and hold your hand to the outside to warm the glue to the skin so it sticks really well. it seems that the glue is toxic to that wart virus and the thickness of the tape suffocates it. then after three days you just peel that off and put a new one on. if you don't like the way that silver duct tape looks you can put a bandage over it and it works great for wart virus of the foot as well.,"['wart', 'hand']",wmd

can a brain blood clot cause low blood pressure?,it will not it is the other way around. blood clots anywhere in the body especially in the brain and heart increases blood pressure. one of the reason is that brain and heart are poor anaerobic performer meaning of all body tissue this 2 cant perform well without enough oxygen so when there is a blood clot oxygen supply decreases as well and when oxygen supply decreases some of the cells starts to deteriorate and when those cells are damaged and start to die they releases enzymes that transmit impulses to our vital sign center(medulla oblongata) that they are lacking oxygen in response to those impulses it releases enzymes that tell our heart to increase its workload to increase perfusion of blood to those area affected by the blood clot. but this action only worsen patients w/ brain blood clots because as blood pressure increase those blood clots move further till the size or diameter of blood vessel is too small where it can totally block the blood flow. so it is advisable for patient w/ brain blood clot to have stable blood pressure most of the time,"['blood clot', 'low blood pressure', 'brain']",wmd

what is tuberculosis?,tuberculosis (tb) is an infection caused by slow-growing bacteria that grow best in areas of the body that have lots of blood and oxygen. thats why it is most often found in the lungs. this is called pulmonary tb. but tb can also spread to other parts of the body which is called extrapulmonary tb. treatment is often a success but it is a long process. it takes about 6 to 9 months to treat tb. tuberculosis is either latent or active. latent tb means that you have the tb bacteria in your body but your bodys defenses (immune system) are keeping it from turning into active tb. this means that you don't have any symptoms of tb right now and can't spread the disease to others. if you have latent tb it can become active tb. active tb means that the tb bacteria are growing and causing symptoms. if your lungs are infected with active tb it is easy to spread the disease to others. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

why do middle ear infections increase in the winter?,there are many seasonal reasons for the increase in the number of cases of otitis media (middle ear infections) but the no. 1 culprit has got to be colds. colds are due to viruses of course and kids are notorious for collecting them. the children that i see in day-care pre-school and the elementary years are usually active members of the cold of the month club.  colds are the no. 1 predisposing factor for ear infections. if we could prevent or at least control colds there would certainly be fewer ear infections. for generations researchers have tried to come up with an effective vaccine against colds but since there are over 200 different viruses â€” viruses that change/mutate â€” a vaccine is not likely any time soon. there are some good things about colds â€” really. colds are usually minor and self-limiting in about a week. these little annoying viruses do stimulate the immune system and a stronger immune system can fight off the more serious attacks. so even if we could prevent all colds it may be messing with mother nature and make things worse. like it not colds are here to stay at least for the foreseeable future. the cold and flu season is closely tied to the ear infection season or as i call it snowtitis. as the weather gets colds windows close and people tend to stay inside more. in closed spaces viruses are more likely to spread. if it is raining outside schools do not let the kids out for recess. ventilation in some schools is inadequate and hygiene is often non-existent. the janitorial staff will empty the trash but it would be rare for them to routinely disinfect surfaces. bathrooms may be clean at the start of the school day but tend to look like those outdoor privies in mumbai by lunch time. some children are more ear-infection prone. if one or both parents had lots of ear infections the apple may not fall far from the tree. children who go to day-care or preschool at an early age are more prone to get sick. some of those viruses may set the stage for middle-ear infections. after age six when kids have 50 or so colds under their immunity belt they get considerably fewer middle ear infections. breast-fed children are less likely to get ear infections than children who are bottle-fed and children who are given a bottle of milk to hold at bedtime are also more prone. children who are exposed to cigarette smoke tend to have more ear infections. there have even been studies that show that families who heat with wood stoves or fireplaces in the winter have a higher incidence. smoke of any type is not good for kids. the last risk factor worth mentioning is pacifiers. several european studies have shown these to be an ear-infection risk in children under four. i suspect kids over four are not using them at least i hope they are not. remember that ear pain is not necessarily an ear infection. parents and grandparents have been telling kids for generations to cover their ears when they are outside to prevent ear infections. this practice will not prevent ear infections but can prevent some cold-related ear pain that some (not all) people can experience. the sensory receptors in the ear canal can really fire up from a cold breeze. if you are cold-sensitive wear a hat or ear muffs but dont think it is going to ward off infections. oh and dont tell this to your grandma. i dont want to get any nasty postings. when you are getting out your winter clothing snow shovels windshield ice scrapes be prepared for a few trips to your medical provider. you may want to consider getting a home otoscope to add to your winter supplies.,"['middle ear', 'infection']",wmd

what is a homa calculation?,"homa calculation is a good adjunct to a1c and glucose testing in folks with type 2 diabete prediabetes or risk of diabetes due to family history or obesity. i believe more endocrinologists and other clinicians caring for such patients will use the homa calculator more routinely in the future. not to diagnose diabetes but rather to gain insight into the relative contributions of beta cell dysfunction and insulin resistance in folks with elevated a1c. i suspect homa can be used to spot people at risk for diabetes sooner than current screening tests (fasting glucose or a1c) however the appropriateness of this test for screening and perhaps for diagosis would need to be studied scientifically. in the meantime i believe it is a useful clinical tool under the right circumstances. . pancreatic beta cell function can be roughly estimated by measuring fasting insulin and glucose simultaneously (ask your doctor for these blood tests) then using. [a] homa calculator to assess the estimated beta cell activity and insulin resistance. . homa stands for ""homeostasis model assessment"". the general concept is that the higher your insulin resistance (due to excess body fat genetics or other causes) the harder your beta cells need to work to produce enough insulin to keep the glucose levels normal. someone with lots of insulin resistance say twice as much (200%) of a normal healthy person will have to have lots of beta cell activity (150% or 200%) just to compensate. over many years of excess beta cell activity (over 100% activity) then in some individuals the beta cell activity will start to peter out as reflected by lower insulin levels (or inappropriately non-elevated insulin levels in the face of mildly elevated glucose) and the calculator will indicate there is only around 50% beta cell activity. the a1c doesn't start to go up into the prediabetic range (a1c 6. 0-6. 4) until the beta cell activity is around 60%-50%. beta cell activity in the 40% or less range is what we see in type 2 diabetes. if we measured insulin and glucose and used the homa calculator in seemingly normal patients with moderate-to-high risk of eventual type 2 diabetessuch as patients with parents or siblings with type 2 or in patients wiith obesity then we could probably clarify the diabetes risk even sooner. we would not have to wait until beta cell function is 60%. we could spot it when it is at 80% etc. and monitor it. i think this is a concept scientists should explore further as a potential component of a national diabetes prevention/reversal strategy. .",[],wmd

can cigarettes smoke stain clothing and/or skin with chemicals or toxins harmful to a newborn baby? . i am wondering if anyone who smokes and then holds or is around my newborn can cause any harm from anything on their clothing or skin.,well this is an interesting question. i'm not sure there's a straightforward answer because i'm not sure anyone has studied this. here's what we know: smoking around infants and children can cause them to inhale second-hand smoke which may be linked to higher rates of certain lung problems like asthma. we also know second-hand smoke contains harmful chemicals and that this smoke (containing chemicals) can settle on surfaces such as clothing draperies countertops and so on. will coming in contact with this potentially toxic material on someone's shirt (or fingertips) cause problems for your baby? my guess (and it's strictly a guess! ) is probably not. if this were the case the entire baby boomer generation would probably exhibit symptoms because nearly all of our relatives smoked and held babies at the same time. you can reduce any possible risk by gently wiping off your baby with a damp cloth after he or she has been cuddled by someone you believe has tobacco smoke residue on their clothing or hands. you probably don't need to be overly aggressive about this. don't scrub the little one's skin off. but a simple swipe should do the trick. hope this helps!,"['skin', 'newborn', 'baby', 'smoking']",wmd

can severe bruising from wisdom teeth extractions cause facial paresthesia? is it likely to go away? . i had my 3 remaining wisdom teeth extracted 5 days ago. yesterday the swelling finally started to go down and severe yellow-green-purple bruising started to show. i also have little feeling and a tingling sensation in my lower lip right side of chin and lower front teeth. i read a lot of stuff about mandibular nerve damage causing paresthesia. is that my problem or could the severe bruising be what's causing the numb feeling? will this feeling eventually go away as my mouth continues to heal?,"i'm no expert on wisdom teeth extraction and you certainly have my sympathy on that point by the way. but i think you hit the nail on the head when you mentioned ""swelling.

what type of seizure last for about 16 to 20 minutes?,"well let me start by noting that not all body shaking is caused by a seizure. seizures are caused by abnormal brain signals while other types of involuntary body movement such as tremors may be hereditary and of unknown origin. there also are different types of seizures. some of them involve mild to severe convulsions but some of them merely cause a person to sort of stare off into space for awhile as if they can't hear you. seizures rarely (dare i say ""never"") last up to 20 minutes. most seizures last just a few minutes maybe 3 to 5 minutes or so before they end. if you believe you've had a seizure you should see a doctor for further examination and assessment. it's important to do this because a seizure can be a symptom of another underlying health problem such as in infection. i hope this helps! it is because i am a survivor of one. i have epilepsy from several head injuries and in 2012 minutes after surgery for a lumbar laminectomy i had a documented +30 minute seizure which ended with having a 4 day stay in icu along with scaring a surgeon and a anesthesiologist. even with all the precautions a 6 hour stay ended up with a 4 day camping trip at one of my least favorite places. luckily i don't remember anything except for the usual aura headaches and tiredness after each seizure. what saved my life was communication asking questions and family and doctor support. meds i take: keppra and depakote.",['seizure'],wmd

how should i manage breast changes during pregnancy?,most pregnant women will feel some changes in their breasts. your breasts will increase in size as your milk glands enlarge and the fat tissue increases causing breast firmness and tenderness in the first and last few months of pregnancy. bluish veins may also appear as your blood supply increases. your nipples will also darken and a thick fluid called colostrum may leak from your breasts. all of these breast changes are normal. recommendations: wear a bra that provides firm support. choose cotton bras or those made from other natural fibers. increase your bra size as your breasts become larger. your bra should fit well without irritating your nipples. try maternity or nursing bras which provide more support and can be used after pregnancy if you choose to breastfeed. to ease discomfort and maintain support try wearing a bra during the night and day. tuck a cotton handkerchief or gauze pad into each bra cup to absorb leaking fluid. nursing pads which you can buy in a pharmacy are also available. make sure to change these pads as needed to prevent irritation to the underlying skin. clean your breasts with warm water only; do not use soap or other products since they can cause dryness.,"['pregnancy', 'breast']",wmd

what medications and foods should i avoid before surgery?,we know aspirin interferes with blood clotting so people go off aspirin for some period of time. but often patients dont know that some of the other medications they are taking without a prescription again or even with prescription may interfere. so we have a list of over 200 medications over the counter and prescription that are known to contain elements that would interfere with blood clotting and we give it to the patient well in advance of the surgery and say look through this list and if youre taking any of these please stop or lets talk about. and we ask very specifically on our questionnaires what medicines are you taking both prescription medications and non-prescription medications. we are trying to make sure the patient doesnt forget or doesnt disregard the importance of these medications that could interfere by the way not only with the bleeding but even with the anesthesia. there are certain drugs that the anesthesiologist would be very unhappy if he didnt know the patient were taking. but its not just supplements and prescriptions. what about foods? well garlic and ginger for example when consumed in large amounts can cause some change in clotting yeah so we tell people about it. we tell people those things that would get them into trouble. by the way foods can also help us though because papaya and pineapple rich in an enzyme called papase which is the same thing that is in meat tenderizer after surgery very good because they help digest the red cells that cause bruising. when you see a bruise its because the red cells in the blood have seeped into the tissues and it helps digest them. so you know foods can work for us and they can also work against us. but we need to know. this is the most important thing. and this is why its so important to have a very complete evaluation by the cosmetic surgeon a very complete evaluation by your personal doctor so that none of these things would slip through the cracks. we dont want anything slipping through the cracks. an anesthesiologists worst nightmare is that the patient took a drug that the anesthesiologist didnt know about and that drug was in the patients system and could interfere sometimes significantly with a safe anesthetic.,"['surgery', 'food', 'drug']",wmd

what effect will stopping zoloft 50mg and focalin xr 20 mg have on 17year old?,these are not medications that should be stopped abruptly. zoloft in particular needs to be tapered to avoid potentially serious side effects such as suicidal feelings. zoloft normally is used to treat depression. therefore stopping zoloft can allow depressive symptoms to return. focalin normally is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd). stopping it can cause adhd symptoms to be uncontrolled. if you are the 17-year-old in question i suggest you participate in decision that affect your health. ask your parents to make an appointment with the doctor so you can discuss the pros and cons of taking these medications. you of all people need to understand why you're taking the medications what the potential side effects are and how long the therapy is expected to last. if you are the parent of the 17-year-old try to involve your teen in the medical decision-making process. individuals who feel empowered tend to take more responsibility for their medication regimens than those who feel medications are being forced upon them. as i said under no circumstances should zoloft be abruptly withdrawn. this can cause serious negative consequences. wishing you well!,[],wmd

what exams and tests help doctors to evaluate or test people for ringworm of the scalp or beard?,doctors can often easily recognize ringworm when there is a distinct ringworm -patterned rash. your doctor will probably also look at a hair or skin sample (koh preparation) under a microscope to determine whether a fungus is present. tests used for ringworm of the scalp or beard include: a koh (potassium hydroxide) preparation which your doctor can use to find out whether the skin condition is caused by a fungus. a fungal culture ( skin culture ) which your doctor usually will do only if diagnosis is difficult or the skin condition is not responding to treatment. the test results may take 4 to 6 weeks. early detection if someone in your family has ringworm of the scalp or beard talk to your doctor about whether other family members should be examined. it is quite common for one family member to spread the fungus to other family members. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

how are migraine headaches treated?,treatment for migraines includes therapies that may or may not involve medication. nonmedication therapies for migraine therapy that does not involve medications can provide symptomatic and preventative therapy. using ice biofeedback and relaxation techniques may be helpful at stopping an attack once it has started. if possible sleep is the best medicine. preventing migraine takes motivation for the patient to make some life changes. patients are educated as to triggering factors that can be avoided. these include smoking cessation avoiding certain foods especially those high in tyramine (sharp cheeses) or those containing sulphites (wines) or nitrates (nuts processed meats). generally leading a healthy lifestyle with good nutrition adequate fluid intake sufficient sleep and exercise may be useful. acupuncture has been suggested to be a useful nonmedication therapy. medication therapies for migraine individuals with occasional mild migraine headaches that do not interfere with daily activities usually medicate themselves with over-the-counter (otc nonprescription) pain relievers (analgesics). many otc analgesics are available. otc analgesics have been shown to be safe and effective for short-term relief of headache (as well as muscle aches pains menstrual cramps and fever) when used according to the instructions on their labels. there are two major classes of otc analgesics: acetaminophen (tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids). the two types of nsaids are aspirin and nonaspirin. examples of nonaspirin nsaids are ibuprofen (advil nuprin motrin ib and medipren) and naproxen (aleve). aspirin acetaminophen and caffeine also are available combined in otc analgesics for the treatment of headaches. examples of such combination analgesics are pain-aid excedrin fioricet and fiorinal. finding an effective analgesic or analgesic combination often is a process of trial and error because individuals respond differently to different analgesics. in general a person should use the analgesic that has worked in the past. this will increase the likelihood that an analgesic will be effective and decrease the risk of side effects. there are several precautions that should be observed with otc analgesics: children and teenagers should not use aspirin for the treatment of headaches other pain or fever because of the risk of developing reye's syndrome a life-threatening neurological disease that can lead to coma and even death. patients with balance disorders or hearing difficulties should avoid using aspirin because aspirin may aggravate these conditions. patients taking blood thinners such as warfarin (coumadin) should not take aspirin and nonaspirin nsaids without a doctor's supervision because they add further to the risk of bleeding that is caused by the blood thinner. patients with active ulcers of the stomach and duodenum should not take aspirin and nonaspirin nsaids because they can increase the risk of bleeding from the ulcer and impair healing of the ulcer. patients with advanced liver disease should not take aspirin and nonaspirin nsaids because they may impair kidney function. deterioration of kidney function in these patients can lead to kidney failure. patients should not overuse otc or prescription analgesics. overuse of analgesics can lead to the development of tolerance (increasing ineffectiveness of the analgesic) and rebound headaches (return of the headache as soon as the effect of the analgesic wears off usually in the early morning hours). thus overuse of analgesics can lead to a vicious cycle of more and more analgesics for headaches that respond less and less to treatment.,"['migraine', 'headache']",wmd

do i really need both ob/gyn and primary care provider at this stage in my life or could do without one. mean i currently have both but switching ob/gyns in the same practice as each other. i really like my current pcp and in which shes my prescribing doctor for my antidepressant. at the same time she doesn't have any admitting privileges at the hospital but the ob/gyn has them of course. anyway my pcp and ob/gyn are into separate offices locations from each other. the ob/gyn's office location is pretty much nearer my house then pcp.,"most helpful answer i guess that would depend on the scope of practice for each one. many primary care providers are not that keen on providing gynecological care (assuming your ob days are over) and some ob-gyns are not crazy about handling your depression or dealing with hundreds of other non-gynecological problems that a woman might develop. if you had to pick one pick the primary care provider but consider finding one that has hospital privileges if that is important to you. many hospitals now use ""hospitalists"" that take over your case once you are admitted so not having hospital privileges may not be a big problem. talk to them both about your situation and you will see where they stand.",['antidepressant'],wmd
is there a reaction between smoking cannibis and taking vicoden?,well first i'm obligated to note that marijuana smoking is illegal under u. s. federal law even in states that regulate the use of medical marijuana. but as to your question: there shouldn't be any conflict between cannabis use and vicodin (hydrocodone). cannabis is not an opioid the way hydrocodone is. both substances provide mild pain relief so if anything cannabis might make you feel as if the pain relieving effect of the hydrocodone is enhanced. that said it's generally not a good idea to mix drugs with similar properties (such as pain relievers). so your best bet is to avoid smoking marijuana while taking hydrocodone. the hydrocodone should provide sufficient pain relief on its own. if it doesn't please contact your health care provider for a different pain reliever. there are plenty to choose from! hope this helps!,"['smoking', 'reaction']",wmd

is bupropion the same as budeprion. that's all i want to know. i have been taking buproprion for a year and have never felt it did much good. is it the same drug as budeprion? the fda has just released a statement stating that budeprion is not equivalent to wellbutrin so i'd like to know. thank you,i am glad you raised this question. bupropion is the generic or chemical name of the drug and budeprion and wellbutrin are brand names. drugs can have both a generic name and a brand name. the fda released a statement that the brand named medication; budeprion xl 300 mg is not therapeutically equivalent to the brand named medication wellbutrin xl 300 mg. this means that these two versions of bupropion xl 300 mg do not work the same when given to patients. when a suffix or ending is attached to a drug that refers to how often it is taken. bupropion xl (extended release) is taken once daily; bupropion sr (sustained release) and is taken twice daily; and bupropion 300 mg (immediate release) is taken 3 times daily. the fda statement pertained only to the xl 300 mg dose. when brand named medications lose their patents different manufacturers can make their version or the medication can be marketed under the generic name. generic and brand named drugs should contain the exact same active drug and have the same dosage intended use action side effects risks and safety. the difference between generics and different brands of the same drug is that they may vary in the inactive components. these inactive components include dyes and fillers. the fda does studies to make sure that all the different brands and generic formulations are the same. the fda did the studies on the dose of bupropion xl 150 mg and concluded that all the manufacturers were making equivalent medications. the fda did not study the 300 mg dose but assumed the 300 mg would be just as good. due to complaints from patients the fda finally studied the 300 mg dose and found that the budeprion and the wellbutrin version of bupropion xl 300 mg were not the same. there was a difference in the rate to which they were released into the blood stream. there are ongoing studies on the manufacturers of other versions of bupropion xl 300 mg. some physicians feel that the differences in the inactive components of a drug do influence the availability of a drug to the target tissue (bioavailability). this difference is not usually felt to be clinically significant. talk to your doctor about your use of bupropion to determine whether the formulation you are using is the right one for you.,['drug'],wmd

what kind of exercise is beneficial for people with diabetes?,aerobic exercise and resistance training are both beneficial for diabetes and lower the hemoglobin a1c levels. structured exercise programs typically produce better results than exercise advice simply because the structured exercise programs achieve greater intensity and duration and greater compliance than when patients are left to their own devices to get the recommended exercise. in fact studies with exercise advice typically produced no improvement in the hemoglobin a1c (due to poor compliance) unless dietary improvements were also made. the best combination is always simultaneous dietary improvement plus exercise (cardio and/or resistance) and the more structured or formalized the better. in fact while patients who achieve the standard recommended 2. 5 hours per week see greater improvements in hemoglobin a1c than those who do not meet this standard; those patients who exceed the standard get even greater improvements!,"['diabetes', 'exercise']",wmd

under health-care reform when will there be fewer restrictions on mental-health sessions? . why is an insurance company allowed to limit how many therapy sessions a patient can have a year?,last year the obama administration issued new rules that prohibit group health-insurance plans â€” typically offered by employers â€” from restricting access to care by limiting mental-health benefits and requiring higher patient costs than those that apply to general medical or surgical benefits. the rules implement the paul wellstone and pete domenici mental health parity and addiction equity act of 2008 (mhpaea). in other words the mhpaea states that a group health plan may not impose annual or lifetime dollar limits on mental-health benefits that are less favorable than any such limits imposed on medical surgical benefits. the affordable care act also takes steps to help people access the mental health services they need: right now if you havent been able to find health insurance due to a pre-existing mental-health condition you may be able to access the new pre-existing condition insurance plan. starting in 2014 substance abuse or mental illness can no longer be used by insurers to deny coverage as a pre-existing condition â€“ and insurers also wont be able to use those conditions to raise your premiums. also in 2014 mental-health and substance-use disorder services will be part of the essential benefits package a set of health-care service categories that must be covered by certain plans including all insurance policies that will be offered through the exchanges and most coverage in medicaid. these reforms all work to make the health-insurance marketplace a more accessible affordable place for people with mental-health and substance-abuse disorders.,[],wmd

how are gallstones treated?,there are a number of ways to treat gallstones though most gallstones are silent. if silent gallstones are discovered in someone age 65 or older the chance of developing symptoms from the gallstones is only 20%(or less assuming a life span of 75 years. in this instance it is reasonable not to treat the individual. among younger people no treatment also might be appropriate if they have serious lifethreatening diseases  for example serious heart disease  that are likely to shorten their life span. on the other hand in healthy young people treatment should be considered even for silent gallstones because the chances of developing symptoms from the gallstones over a lifetime is higher. once symptoms begin treatment should be recommended since further symptoms are likely and more serious complications can be prevented. cholecystectomy cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder surgically) is the standard treatment for gallstones in the gallbladder. surgery may be done through a large abdominal incision or laparoscopically through small punctures of the abdominal wall. laparoscopic surgery results in less pain and a faster recovery. cholecystectomy has a low rate of complications but serious complications such as damage to the bile ducts and leakage of bile occasionally occur. there also is risk associated with the general anesthesia that is necessary for either type of surgery. problems following removal of the gallbladder are few. digestion is not affected and no change in diet is necessary. chronic diarrhea occurs in approximately 10% of patients. sphincterotomy and extraction of gallstones sometimes a gallstone may be stuck in the hepatic or common bile ducts. in such situations there usually are gallstones in the gallbladder as well and cholecystectomy is necessary. it may be possible to remove the gallstone stuck in the duct at the time of surgery but this may not always be possible. another way to remove gallstones in the duct before or after cholecystectomy is with sphincterotomy followed by extraction of the gallstone. sphincterotomy involves cutting the muscle of the common bile duct (sphincter) at the junction of the common bile duct and the duodenum in order to allow easier access to the common bile duct. the cutting is done with an electrosurgical instrument passed through the same type of endoscope that is used for ercp. after the sphincter is cut instruments may be passed through the endoscope and up into the hepatic and common bile ducts to grab and pull out the gallstone or to crush the gallstone. it also is possible to pass a lithotripsy instrument that uses high-frequency sound waves to break up the gallstone. complications of sphincterotomy and extraction of gallstones include the general anesthesia perforation of the bile ducts or duodenum bleeding and pancreatitis. oral dissolution therapy it is possible to dissolve some cholesterol gallstones with medication taken orally. the medication is a naturally-occurring bile acid called ursodeoxycholic acid or ursodiol (actigall urso). bile acids are one of the detergents that the liver secretes into bile to dissolve cholesterol. ursodiol reduces the amount of cholesterol secreted in bile. the bile then has less cholesterol and becomes capable of dissolving the cholesterol in the gallstones. there are important limitations to the use of ursodiol: it is only effective for cholesterol gallstones and not pigment gallstones. it works only for small gallstones less than 1 centimeter-1. 5 centimeter in diameter. it takes one to two years for the gallstones to dissolve and many of the gallstones reform following cessation of treatment. due to these limitations ursodiol generally is used only in people with smaller gallstones that are likely to have a very high cholesterol content and who are at high risk for surgery because of ill health. it also is reasonable to use ursodiol in people whose gallstones were likely to have formed because of a transient event for example rapid loss of weight since the gallstones would not be expected to recur following successful dissolution. extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (eswl) is an infrequently used method for treating gallstones particularly those lodged in bile ducts. eswl generators produces shock waves outside of the body that are then focused on the gallstone. the shock waves shatter the gallstone and the resulting pieces of the gallstone either drain into the intestine on their own or are extracted endoscopically as in sphincterotomy.,['gallstone'],wmd

can being a cf carrier cause copd symptoms to accelerated?,"that's a good question. i can see why you might make that connection since both cystic fibrosis (cf) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) involve the lungs. cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease that causes mucus throughout the body to become thick and sticky. this becomes very evident in the lungs where there's a lot of mucus. in order to get cf a child must inherit a gene defect from both parents. if only one parent passes along the gene mutation that causes cf the child is called a cf ""carrier"" because if he or she has a child with another person who is a cf carrier their child will have cystic fibrosis. if you are a cf carrier you do not have the disease and cannot get the disease. cf is not in any way related to copd which is usually caused by external factors such as smoking tobacco. copd is not an inherited disease and cannot be ""caught"" from another person. copd is not in any way related to  or associated with  carrying the cystic fibrosis gene mutation. if a cystic fibrosis carrier develops copd this is in no way related to the person's genetic status and the cf gene mutation in no way affects the individual's copd. wishing you well!","['chronic obstructive pulmonary disease', 'cystic fibrosis']",wmd

how is hypothyroidism diagnosed?,"a diagnosis of hypothyroidism can be suspected in patients with fatigue cold intolerance constipation and dry flaky skin. a blood test is needed to confirm the diagnosis. when hypothyroidism is present the blood levels of thyroid hormones can be measured directly and are usually decreased. however in early hypothyroidism the level of thyroid hormones (t3 and t4) may be normal. therefore the main tool for the detection of hyperthyroidism is the measurement of tsh the thyroid stimulating hormone. tsh is secreted by the pituitary gland. if a decrease of thyroid hormone occurs the pituitary gland reacts by producing more tsh and the blood tsh level increases in an attempt to encourage thyroid hormone production. this increase in tsh can actually precede the fall in thyroid hormones by months or years. thus the measurement of tsh should be elevated in cases of hypothyroidism. however there is one exception. if the decrease in thyroid hormone is actually due to a defect of the pituitary or hypothalamus then the levels of tsh are abnormally low. this kind of thyroid disease is known as ""secondary"" or ""tertiary"" hypothyroidism. a special test known as the trh test can help distinguish if the disease is caused by a defect in the pituitary or the hypothalamus. this test requires an injection of the trh hormone and is performed by an endocrinologist (hormone specialist). blood work confirms the diagnosis of hypothyroidism but does not point to an underlying cause. a combination of the patient's clinical history antibody screening and a thyroid scan can help diagnose the precise underlying thyroid problem more clearly. if a pituitary or hypothalamic cause is suspected an mri of the brain and other studies may be warranted. these investigations should be made on a case-by-case basis.",['hypothyroidism'],wmd

will hot baths permanently damage sperm?,sperm producing cells in the testicles are very heat sensitive which is why a human male's testicles are in the bottom of the scrotum. when cold they pull in tight. when hot they relax and pull away. the thin wrinkled skin of the scrotum also allows for rapid heat dissipation like radiator fins on a car or air conditioning unit. the type of underwear you wear makes no difference in many studies. hot tubs are indeed bad for fertility but only for the few months after until you can make new sperm (the sperm production cycle is 74 to 90 days long). i tell my fertility and vasectomy reversal patients to avoid hot tubs hot baths jacuzzis or hot saunas.,"['injury', 'sperm']",wmd

can fibromyalgia cause muscles to tear more easily?,"based on my experience over the years i think fm makes our muscles more susceptible to strains or tears/injuries within the muscles. also we seem to be more susceptible to getting tendinitis and bursitis. some of this may be due to certain deficiencies that we with fibro develop like low intracellular magnesium levels low muscle energy (atp) and low growth hormone levels that interfere with the protection flexibility and recovery of the muscles and soft tissues. our soft tissues may be more susceptible to the degenerative ""wear and tear"" changes we all get with aging and overuse. also our muscles act more ""deconditioned"" when we have fm which increases our chance of an injury. fm doesn't cause/aggravate disc disease or arthritis changes but the reverse situation is true. that is disc and arthritic disease can aggravate fm symptoms. i don't believe in automatically attributing any soft tissue problem to fm. in fact most of the times something else like a trauma or a degenerative problem is ""clearly"" identified as the direct cause of the tear or bursitis/tendinitis. but we can surmise that the fm probably played a secondary role in a lot of these situations. no i dont believe so","['fibromyalgia', 'muscle']",wmd

does sugar feed cancer?,"according to the american cancer society's website: ""no sugar intake has not been shown to directly increase the risk of getting cancer or having it get worse (progress). still sugars and sugar-sweetened drinks add large amounts of calories to the diet and can cause weight gain which we know can affect cancer outcomes. "" it makes sense to eat a healthy whole food based diet with cancer which would naturally be low in added sugars but no one can say for sure if it feeds cancer. for more on diet see this webmd article. the american caner association is either being extremely negligent evasive or just plain ignorant when it comes to cancer. according to german doctor otto wartberg the ""crux of his nobel thesis was that malignant tumors frequently exhibit an increase in anaerobic glycolysis  a process whereby glucose is used as a fuel by cancer cells with lactic acid as an anaerobic byproduct  compared to normal tissues. 1 the large amount of lactic acid produced by this fermentation of glucose from cancer cells is then transported to the liver. this conversion of glucose to lactate generates a lower more acidic ph in cancerous tissues as well as overall physical fatigue from lactic acid buildup. 2 3 thus larger tumors tend to exhibit a more acidic ph. 4 this inefficient pathway for energy metabolism yields only 2 moles of adenosine triphosphate (atp) energy per mole of glucose compared to 38 moles of atp in the complete aerobic oxidation of glucose. by extracting only about 5 percent (2 vs. 38 moles of atp) of the available energy in the food supply and the body's calorie stores the cancer is ""wasting"" energy and the patient becomes tired and undernourished. this vicious cycle increases body wasting. 5 it is one reason why 40 percent of cancer patients die from malnutrition or cachexia. 6 hence cancer therapies should encompass regulating blood-glucose levels via diet supplements non-oral solutions for cachectic patients who lose their appetite medication exercise gradual weight loss and stress reduction. professional guidance and patient self-discipline are crucial at this point in the cancer process. the quest is not to eliminate sugars or carbohydrates from the diet but rather to control blood glucose within a narrow range to help starve the cancer and bolster immune function.

birth control shot making me fat and moody? . i was on the pill for about 6 months but switched to the shot because of depression issues. i have been on the shot for about 9 months now and have gained about 30 pounds and am very moody. i need to be on birth control but don't know what method would work best for me.,i've gone back and forth with the depo injections and oral contraceptives for the last decade or so i can't decide which is the lesser of the evils. there are certainly pros and cons to each but in the end i decided to stick with the oral contraceptives. why? although convenient (you only go in every quarter or so for a shot) but like you i've gained quite a bit of weight after the initial shot and my weight continue to skyrocket with each injection. after about three years i have gained a total of about 1/3 of my pre-depo body weight! not only was my body image suffering since the injections but my moods swings were swinging at full force i was tired all the time and my calcium levels were fast depleting! i loved the convenience of not having to take the pill on a daily basis but side effects of the injections turned me into someone who i ultimately hate! now that i'm back on the pill most of the side effects i've suffered from the depo has left my system and i'm somewhat back to my pre-depo body weight but i'm feeling so much more energized and alive! i didn't know the extent of the side effects until i decided on another form of birth control. true the pill may be a pain in the rear for someone as forgetful as i am but i'd rather forget and have to use a backup method than to suffer the ill effects the depo injections. birth control is a definite must for some women (myself included) and i've accepted the fact that there are side effects to any substance we take but it shouldn't interfere with our daily lives and turn us into someone/something we're not! with this experience i've learned that depo injections just didn't work for me but it may for others. in the end i think you should have an in-depth discussion with your gyn weigh your options and figure which will work best for you based on your needs your lifestyle and your preference.,"['depression', 'birth control', 'injection']",wmd

i am not sure if i have rosacea. please help.,rosacea is a skin disorder that affects people above 30 years. other than acne like lesions people with rosacea have redness of face and dry skin associated with burning sensation. they also have redness and irritation in the eyes. the redness of the face is aggravated by triggering factors such as weather changes stress alcohol consumption exercise and spicy food. yours clinical condition is not rosacea since your history is contradicting with the above said information. you seem to have acne. the cysts are a part of acne. acne varies in severity from individual to individual. some may have mild acne which may come off and on. others may have almost incessant eruption of acne which may leave behind post acne hyperpigmentation and acne scars. for acne you need to be constantly taking care care of your skin until the tendency for new acne formation dies down. topical treatment of acne mainly revolves around topical antibacterials (clindamycin gel or nadifloxacin gel) benzoyl peroxide and topical retinoids. topical retinoids are comedolytic thereby preventing new acne. for inflammatory acne (papules and pustules) i advise to start with one of the oral antibiotics either azithromycin doxycycline or minocycline. cystic acne is an indication for starting oral retinoids. they are the most effective drugs for acne and are usually first choice in severe acne or cystic acne or moderately severe acne or acne not responding adequately to traditional anti-acne medications or acne significantly affecting the quality of life of patients regardless of severity. you could also take a few peeling sessions like salicylic acid peels from a dermatologist. salicylic acid peels are specific for acne. acne is a recurrent condition and once your acne is brought under good control with oral and topical anti-acne medicines you should still continue to use a cream/gel (topical retinoid) for maintenance of improvement. topical retinoids are ideal for maintenance of improvement because they are comedolytic as well as anti-inflammatory thereby preventing the formation of new acne. for further follow up consult a dermatologist online  ,['acne scars'],ic

what is the connection between mitral valve prolapse and fibromyalgia?,mitral valve prolapse (mvp) is often seen in fm. i conducted a study years ago at the ohio state university and published results that showed the majority of people with fm also had evidence of mvp on cardiac echo testing. mvp is a condition where one of the heart valves the mitral valve bulges excessively during the heartbeat. although it sounds scary most doctors feel that mvp is usually a benign condition. it may contribute to atypical chest wall pain in some patients with fm or it may be part of the dysfunctional autonomic nerves and contribute to rapid heart rate palpitations and shortness of breath in some. we're not sure exactly why those with fm seem to have more mvp than the general population. perhaps there is a genetic factor involved or a dynamic change that results from the dysfunctional autonomic nerves. more research is needed in this area. chest pain in fm is usually not angina but people with fm can have other problems too including heart problems. if there is ever any questions about chest pain or new cardiac symptoms a physician should be consulted at once.,"['fibromyalgia', 'mitral valve prolapse']",wmd

why dont men take better care of themselves?,the problem is when men are young theyre going to live forever nothings going to get in their way thats why young guys do stupid things. because its not going to hurt them. why are teenagers promiscuous in the face of hiv hepatitis c and all those other diseases because it will happen to somebody else but it wont happen to them and then as men get older they get into this pattern of reactive care. they dont understand about proactive health care they dont understand that thats their body for life that they have to be in tune with their body and take care of it and if they do the quality of their life experience will be dramatically improved. but when they do these abusive things when they drink too much drugs overweight then that impacts on them. they dont realize that that never happening to me  it will happen and then its just around the corner. and then its often too late. why is it too late? because theyve had years of abusive behaviors. theyve eaten the wrong foods theyve had too much to drink they smoke hypertension diabetes liver disorders cholesterol problems. and those are the guys you know you read about people in their 40s and 50s who suddenly get a heart attack and die or have a massive stroke. it doesnt make sense. sometimes its random bad luck but sometimes its things theyve been doing all these years. unlike women who mentally society programs them to be into preventative health. they go to the ob-gyn young in life. they go to the doctor for checkups. women are the leaders in health care in this country almost all of the health care decisions are driven by women. im sure on webmd a lot of the women in fact on the mens health message board a lot of times its women asking the questions. you want to wonder if its about blood in the semen or erection disorders or pain or lumps or bumps how come the guy isnt there asking the question himself? and its because thats not what guys do. guys will comment on it but i dont know whether its fear or denial or maybe they dont value themselves enough but the wives are the ones that go online and ask the questions. even on your message board. even on the mens health message board. women are the ones asking the questions.,[],wmd

my husband switched to fentanyl patches after taking oxycontin for two years. when can he expect relief from his pain?,so pharmacists want to have a patient that comes to me that tells me about this particular medication and saying that its not working i have to ask him a few questions. i want to find out if they are applying the patch in the right way. sometimes patients don't understand that they have to apply a patch to a certain area of the body. they also may not understand that one of the things that they need to do is take off the patch that they shouldn't leave the other patch on and then put on another one. so i tend to ask a lot of questions about how you are using this patch. i will also ask them if they are keeping a diary about how their pain has been since they started it. now my skin is going to be different than your skin. so patches the drug is actually absorbed through the skin and gives the effect. so if your skin might be a little more thicker than mine it might take longer for that drug to pass. in this case i also want to ask the patient if he has made the physician fully aware of how he is using the patch and maybe we need to switch him to a different company. because they all make different platforms of how the drug is absorbed into the skin so he might need a different type of patch. also maybe we need to increase the strength of the patch and see how he does on that. so it's a step wise approach and individualized therapy. the physician probably wants to try this because at some point because of the past medication he was on he may have developed a tolerance to that medication and it wasn't really treating his pain. so the doctor is probably looking at other options instead to make it a little more easier for the patient.,"['skin', 'oxycodone', 'pain']",wmd

my skin is breaking out all of a sudden? about 8 weeks ago i had clear looking skin but now i am getting acne. about 8 weeks ago i didn't really get acne and i haven't really changed my skin regimen much. the only thing i have added to my skin regimen is the kate somerville eradikate acne spot treatment which contains 10% of sulfur. i don't think this is what has been causing my acne since i was having acne before i bought this treatment thus why i bought it. i use clean sheets wash my face twice a day use exfoliator 2 a week use a face mask cleansers spot treatment. but i don't know what else to do,sometimes hitting the outer skin is half the battle. i used to have really bad acne when i was younger and they prescribed me a lot of creams that never worked. i heavily researched online and noticed how a diet plays a significant role in oily skin that results in breakouts. i decided to do a research study of my own and it involved a two week diet of using olive oil grease and other fatty foods. then the next two weeks i ate more vegetables (especially a & c) and also took 50 mg of zinc and cut the saturated fats within 40g and consumed 0 trans fats. the first two weeks i experienced break outs that only seemed to keep getting worse and worse. then the after the first week of eating healthier i noticed a halt and no new acne had sprung up or anything and most of my breakouts began to go away. at the end of the second week my skin had just about cleared up which was expected due to the vitamin a c and zinc helping reduce oily skin. in reality dermatology is a scam when many home remedies can be found in your home. hope this helps,"['acne', 'skin', 'sulfur']",wmd
can low dose (5mg) prednisone help hip bursitis,"maybe if specifically prescribed by your medical provider for this purpose. i caution you against any self-treatment with steroids if this was your intent. i was given a direct injection in my bursae of cortisone which is quite different that taking it orally. if you look up definition of bursitis symptoms and treatment this is one of the recommended treatments. i recently had a fractured femur and am post operative three months and overdid my activity and got this pain i never have had before but with researching bursitis it was like a checklist item. thank goodness i had a follow up post surgical appointment and told my orthopedic doctor he did x-rays of my hip femoral head and the bump swelling i got on the side of my leg definitely follows the symptoms of bursitis. the doctor did not say ""you have bursitis"" but gave me a cortisone injection quickly after seeing the ""bursae bump"" as i call it. that is the only thing i fault him for but am glad i came here and coming from the medical field knew it had to be a bursae as it did not feel like muscle or nerve although i did have sharp sudden pain when it first started. i had been gardening as i was feeling better but think i over did it so i am ""resting"" the area but doing the band exercise gently as recommended by my doctor to strengthen my muscles around my surgical site. so i get to add this incident to now knowing what bursitis feels like. hope this helps someone else get help and evaluated by their doctor.",['bursitis'],wmd

how is malaria transmitted?,the life cycle of the malaria parasite ( plasmodium ) is complicated and involves two hosts humans and anopheles mosquitoes. the disease is transmitted to humans when an infected anopheles mosquito bites a person and injects the malaria parasites (sporozoites) into the blood. sporozoites travel through the bloodstream to the liver mature and eventually infect the human red blood cells. while in red blood cells the parasites again develop until a mosquito takes a blood meal from an infected human and ingests human red blood cells containing the parasites. then the parasites reach the anopheles mosquito's stomach and eventually invade the mosquito salivary glands. when an anopheles mosquito bites a human these sporozoites complete and repeat the complex plasmodium life cycle. p. ovale and p. vivax can further complicate the cycle by producing dormant stages (hypnozoites) that may not develop for weeks to years.,['malaria'],wmd

what are some conventional medicines given for shingles?,your doctor may suggest medications to reduce inflammation ease pain and control your shingles infection. painkillers such as aspirin or acetaminophen can relieve mild pain. anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (motrin) or naproxen (aleve) are also often helpful for pain. antiviral drugs such as acyclovir may help stop progression of the rash especially if used early in the course of the blister breakout. similar drugs such as valtrex or famvir can also be used. these drugs may also help stave off the painful after-effects of shingles known as postherpetic neuralgia. benzoin available over the counter may protect irritated skin when applied to unbroken lesions. antibiotics can keep the infection under control if the area becomes infected by bacteria. tricyclic antidepressants or seizure medication may be prescribed for the pain that lingers after lesions have healed. antidepressants may also help with depression that can occur with the onset of shingles or as a result of the lingering pain. steroids to reduce inflammation and postherpetic neuralgia are considered controversial.,"['shingles', 'drug']",wmd

is it better to apply heat or cold to sore muscles after stenuous exercise?,most helpful answer everything i have read says cold. if there is tissue damage the cold constricts blood flow which reduces spread of cellular components which can cause rupture of nearby cells making the injury worse and longer to heal. heat is not usually applied to an injury until 72 hours have passed. this is to increase circulation and promote healing. more recent research shows movement of skeletal muscles produces hormone-like substances that promote and speed healing of damaged or inflamed tissues throughout the body. so if you can move do. lastly a small meal of four parts carbs and one part protein within 90 minutes of exercise will help speed muscle recovery. the body will use that energy and protein to quickly try to re-construct those damaged tissues. this information is from exercise physiology. ice is typically among the first thing to do in the recovery process after strenuous exercise. icing your muscles helps to reduce pain and decrease swelling and inflammation. ice causes your blood vessels to narrow which will reduce your blood flow to the muscle or injured area. never place ice directly on your skin however. wrap an ice pack around a thin cloth and place on the affected muscle for ten minutes at a time. you can use ice multiple times per day for a few days after exercise but make sure to allow for your skin to return to room temperature before icing after each 10 minute interval. heat is typically applied to uscles or injuries that do not have swelling or inflammation. heat will cause your blood vessels to expand which improves circulation and allows more blood to go to the affected area. heat can be useful for chronic injuries and muscle soreness or it can be used before exercise to stimulate blood flow and help prepare the muscle for exercise. heat should also not be directly applied to skin and should be used for short 10-15 minute intervals. always check with your doctor before starting treatment of an injury especially if the condition worsens or fails to improve. within the first few days of an injury ice can help the process of healing. applying ice to injured tissue can cause blood vessels to shrink and this makes them less capable of releasing chemicals that lead to swelling inflammation and pain. after a few days it probably best to apply heat to sore muscles. this makes muscle spasms less likely and relaxes injured muscles. however because the events behind every injury are different speak with your doctor first. i have just spent the last 6 weeks in physical therapy. they always apply heat or have me get on a bike to heat up my muscles for 15 minutes before i go through any table massage work. next i do all my exercises then they end the session with 10 minutes of ice. somtimes what contributes to soreness is 1) lack of warm-up so insuffcicient oxygen was available to fuel the work. and 2) lack of cooldown which will help the muscles recover by completing any partial combustion of sugars for energy leaving residual metabolites such as one feels with the muscle burn of working beyond anerobic threshold. anerobic threshold can be increased through more careful training. i can exercise well beyond my predicted 100% of age heart rate for periods of 10 20 and 30 minutes or more,"['muscle', 'coldness', 'exercise']",wmd
what is eczema?,"eczema is a skin condition caused by inflammation. atopic dermatitis is the most common of the many types of eczema. while the word ""dermatitis"" means inflammation of the skin ""atopic"" refers to an allergic tendency which is often inherited. although atopic dermatitis itself is not caused by an allergy eczema sufferers have a higher risk of developing other allergic conditions (like asthma or hay fever). typically eczema causes skin to become itchy red and dry  even cracked and leathery. eczema most frequently appears on the face and extremities but it can show up in other areas too. eczema is a chronic problem for many people. it is most common among infants many of whom outgrow it before school age.",['atopic dermatitis'],wmd
how is arthritis diagnosed?,arthritis is inflammation in a joint. diagnosis is based on a history of joint pain stiffness and/or warmth redness or swelling and physical examination. the examination can demonstrate swelling and often limited range of motion of the joint. x-ray examination can support the diagnosis and often disclose the type of arthritis and it's severity. early diagnosis is important for early treatment. many types of arthritis can progress without treatment. this can lead to permanent destruction of cartilage bone and ligaments which can result in deformity and loss of function that is not reversible. moreover some forms of arthritis are associated with disease elsewhere in the body. to avoid injury to other body tissues early diagnosis can be crucial.,['arthritis'],wmd

my mom and her sisters had pelvic organ prolapse; can i do anything to prevent it happening to me?,"we cannot change our genetics age or number of vaginal births! sadly there are not many scientific studies testing different forms of pelvic organ prolapse prevention. the strategies for prevention that are most often suggested include: kegel exercises up to four times daily. the hope is that by strengthening muscles in the pelvic floor that those muscles can help delay or reduce the onset of prolapse. physical exercise. regular exercise can help keep one's body weight down and being overweight is linked to prolapse. exercise is also reputed to keep muscles and ligaments more flexible. decrease straining to have a bowel movement. constipation or having to bear down increases pressure in the abdomen which ""pushes down"" on pelvic organs. eating a healthy diet with whole grains fruits and vegetable not only helps constipation but can improve body weight. treat chronic coughs. if one is a smoker  quit. if there is another reason for a chronic cough  have it treated. a cough increases the pressure inside the abdomen which can ""push down"" on pelvic organs. there are studies linking smoking with poorer tissue integrity after pelvic organ prolapse repair. use a correct technique for heavy lifting. straining to lift increases pressure within the abdomen. hysterectomy surgery considerations. if one is having a hysterectomy there are studies which suggest that attaching the uterine ligaments to the top of the vagina may help to keep the vagina from dropping down.","['organ', 'pelvis']",wmd

after hard phys exercise sometimes get bad tunnel vision and a big ball of light right where i try to focus my eyes. why? . i've got a heart murmour and my mum dad and all 4 grand parents had diabetes. not a good start! drama is that after particularly cheeky physical exercise i sometimes get really bad tunnel vision and what seems like a big ball of light right where i'm trying to focus feel dizzy and like i've got pins and needles in both hands. lasts for about 2 hours then goes back to normal. asked the med centre on camp and they have no idea.,i've experience that feeling and its usually because i didn't eat enough during the day before my workout and i pushed myelf too hard. if you are overexherting yourself then it could be that you have low blood sugar and it is causing your dizziness and making you feel light headed. if you are not eating enough during the day before a strenusous workout this could be a side effect. i would try to eat a healthy meal that contains a good balance of protein/carbs/nutrients (try something like a chicken breast and a small sweet potato and maybe a small dinner roll). give your food some time to settle (an hour or two) then during your workout try to sip on a gatorade or vitamin water. try not to over do it when you work out sometimes people push themselves too hard and it can results in injury as well. if you are still experiencing those symptoms after trying this then i would see your doctor to make sure it's not something more serious.,"['eyes', 'hand', 'heart murmur', 'dizziness', 'exercise']",wmd

does exercise help cognitive function?,one of the most exciting areas of exercise research is the investigation of cognitive function. what scientists have learned so far is that brain neurons the special cells that help you think move perform all the bodily functions that keep you alive and even help your memory all increase in number after just a few days or weeks of regular activity. in a study where researchers used an mri machine to measure the amount of brain tissue in adults 55 years of age and older they found  consistent with other studies of aging and brain volume  that there were substantial declines in brain tissue density as a function of age in areas of the brain responsible for thinking and memory but importantly the losses in these areas were substantially reduced as a function of cardiovascular fitness. in other words the fittest individuals had the most brain tissue. how might fitness and more brain tissue help you? in another meta-analysis of older adults researchers found that the fittest individuals had the highest scores on tasks like coordination scheduling planning and memory. and in a recent study of 1 740 adults older than 65 researchers found that the incidence of dementia in individuals who walked three or more times per week was 35% lower than those individuals who walked less than three days per week.,['exercise'],wmd

what are the complications of acid reflux also known as gerd?,ulcers the liquid from the stomach that refluxes into the esophagus damages the cells lining the esophagus. an ulcer is simply a break in the lining of the esophagus that occurs in an area of inflammation. ulcers and the additional inflammation they provoke may erode into the esophageal blood vessels and give rise to bleeding into the esophagus. occasionally the bleeding is severe and may require: blood transfusions. an endoscopic procedure (in which a tube is inserted through the mouth into the esophagus to visualize the site of bleeding and to stop the bleeding). surgical treatment. strictures ulcers of the esophagus heal with the formation of scars (fibrosis). over time the scar tissue shrinks and narrows the lumen (inner cavity) of the esophagus. this scarred narrowing is called a stricture. swallowed food may get stuck in the esophagus once the narrowing becomes severe enough. this situation may necessitate endoscopic removal of the stuck food. then to prevent food from sticking the narrowing must be stretched (widened). barrett's esophagus longstanding and/or severe gerd causes changes in the cells that line the esophagus in some patients. these cells are precancerous and finally become cancerous. this condition is referred to as barrett's esophagus and occurs in approximately 10% of patients with gerd. the type of esophageal cancer associated with barrett's esophagus (adenocarcinoma) is increasing in frequency. it is not clear why some patients with gerd develop barrett's esophagus but most do not. cough and asthma many nerves are in the lower esophagus. some of these nerves are stimulated by the refluxed acid and this stimulation results in pain (usually heartburn). other nerves that are stimulated do not produce pain. instead they stimulate yet other nerves that provoke coughing. in this way refluxed liquid can cause coughing without ever reaching the throat! in a similar manner reflux into the lower esophagus can stimulate esophageal nerves that connect to and can stimulate nerves going to the lungs. these nerves to the lungs then can cause the smaller breathing tubes to narrow resulting in an attack of asthma. inflammation of the throat and larynx if refluxed liquid gets past the upper esophageal sphincter it can enter the throat (pharynx) and even the voice box (larynx). the resulting inflammation can lead to a sore throat and hoarseness. as with coughing and asthma it is not clear just how commonly gerd is responsible for otherwise unexplained inflammation of the throat and larynx. inflammation and infection of the lungs refluxed liquid that passes the larynx can enter the lungs. the reflux of liquid into the lungs (called aspiration) often results in coughing and choking. aspiration however can also occur without producing these symptoms. with or without these symptoms aspiration may lead to infection of the lungs and result in pneumonia. this type of pneumonia is a serious problem requiring immediate treatment. when aspiration is unaccompanied by symptoms it can result in a slow progressive scarring of the lungs (pulmonary fibrosis) that can be seen on chest x-rays. fluid in the sinuses and middle ears the throat communicates with the nasal passages. in small children two patches of lymph tissue called the adenoids are located where the upper part of the throat joins the nasal passages. the passages from the sinuses and the tubes from the middle ears (eustachian tubes) open into the rear of the nasal passages near the adenoids. refluxed liquid that enters the upper throat can inflame the adenoids and cause them to swell. when the sinuses and middle ears are closed off from the nasal passages by the swelling of the adenoids fluid accumulates within them. this accumulation of fluid can lead to discomfort in the sinuses and ears.,"['heartburn', 'reflux']",wmd

my dad is an alcholic and ill. we think he has liver kidney and heart problems. how long does he have to live? . he refuses to see a doctor but is very fatigued and is in bed all day. he also has developed a strange bruise on his chest near his heart. his appetite had diminished and he has lost a lot of weight. he also has yellowing/puffy eyes. he continues to drink daily (vodka). he has high blood pressure (and has most of his life). i also think he is losing his mental capabilities. i just would like to know how much time i have left with him.,i'm very sorry to hear this. alcoholism is a terrible disease. from the symptoms you describe it does sound like your father's physical condition is an advanced state of deterioration. yellowing of the white parts of the eye is a sign of liver failure. fatigue and weight loss often occur toward the end of life. i'm sorry your father won't seek medical attention. and i'm very sorry you have to witness his deterioration. obviously no one can predict how much time any individual has left on earth but in general this situation doesn't sound good. as a person enters the actual dying process they lose the ability to walk lose control of bladder and bowel function and eventually enter a coma-like state before they pass to the other side. are you able to get hospice care for your father? virtually all types of insurance cover this care which could be a great comfort to you and your dad. if your father is reluctant you can perhaps reassure him you only want him to be comfortable during this time of life. hospice care focuses on comfort and pain relief. at the very least perhaps you can get a hospice provider to make a home visit to evaluate the situation. i wish you peace.,"['liver', 'kidney', 'heart', 'vision', 'fatigue']",wmd

is it fine to use mifepristone for abortion after c-section?,first please confirm the pregnancy with a serum beta-hcg test (human chorionic gonadotropin) as urine pregnancy test is not reliable till eight days post missed periods. if the hcg levels are more than 5 ng/dl then she is pregnant. in that case as she has been a post c-section case medical abortion is not to be undertaken with either mifepristone or misoprostol simply. because the c-section scar would still be weak by one year and there are often chances of uterus rupture. the best option in that case would be an ultrasound guided dilation and curettage procedure for surgical abortion. please meet your gynecologist and get the needful. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online  ,['missed period'],ic
can children get hpv and if so could it cause cancer? . i have a 2 strains of hpv one low risk and one high risk. i'm scared my 1 year old could get it before she gets vaccinated from sharing the same bathtub and toilet or her accidentally using my towel one day climbing in my bed where i have had sex with my husband who's probably infected too touching our dirty laundry. i'm not sure how long the virus stays alive for on hands clothes or objects and if she could contract hpv when i change her nappy bathe her or when she touches her private parts.,most helpful answer yes and yes. children can get hpv sometimes through birth and this can result in hpv in a child's throat or larynx for example (laryngeal papillomatosis). untreated this can lead to cancer. teenagers who are sexually involved or children who are sexually-molested can definitely get hpv and this can lead to cancer later in life. it would be highly highly unlikely to get hpv after sharing a bathtub or just using a used towel or other dirty laundry. while viruses can remain on some objects for hours. perhaps longer on wet objects. it really requires more of an intimate contact for an extended period of time to a susceptible person for transmission. some forms of hpv do not lead to cancer. only certain strains. the common wart is an hpv virus. the hpv vaccine for the more dangerous cancer-causing strains is very important and can be given as early as age ten.,"['cancer', 'fear', 'vaccination', 'sexual intercourse', 'virus']",wmd

i am a perimenopausal woman and i have started noticing that my hair is thinning. what can i do to fix this?,thinning hair is a very common problem. it's as common in women as it is in men. but unfortunately for women it's much harder to conceal. and women don't really have the option of going bald and being proud of it the way men do sometimes. so it is important to be able to disguise that. let's start with the underlying causes. there are two types of hair loss that occur in women: scarring and non-scarring. the most common is non-scarring and this tends to be genetic and familial. even if no one in your family had hair loss it can still happen to you and still be part of your genetic makeup. so once you have that issue it's important to be evaluated by a dermatologist or internist or ob/gyn. there are a lot of doctors who can do the evaluations for you. sometimes we check hormonal levels. often even if the hormone tests come back normal there is still somewhat of an hormonal imbalance that may be occurring. people often think that thyroid changes can lead to hair loss but it really doesn't. it may make your hair more dry and brittle but doesn't typically make your hair fall out. but it's worth having your thyroid checked as well to make sure that everything is in order. taking supplements does not really help hair growth. i have a lot of patients who take biotin to help their hair grow. but it doesn't really help if you don't have a biotin deficiency. biotin will make your hair stronger potentially again only if you have a deficiency in that area. there are no other supplements that i know of that have been proven in the literature to help grow hair. however having any nutritional imbalance may have an effect on your hair. another cause of hair loss would be stress. sometimes when you have a stress you can see the hair loss starting about three months later. you have to think about what stress you might have had three to four months before because that's about how long it takes to show. to conceal hair loss you can try combing your hair different changing your hair style or coloring it a little closer to your own natural scalp or skin color. use more neutral tones as opposed to a very dark or light tones. also there are powders that you can add to your hair that work as hair expanders to make your hair appear more full and thick. the one thing you don't want to do is to over tease or over process your hair because then you are pulling it out and causing more damage.,[],wmd

what are the symptoms of copd and heart failure?,copd and heart failure cause the same main symptom: shortness of breath with exertion. people with copd heart failure or both have a limited ability to exercise climb stairs or walk long distances. difficulty breathing occurs for different reasons in copd and heart failure. people with copd have difficulty exhaling all the air in their lungs because of lung damage  often from years of smoking. when it takes longer to exhale completely its hard to increase the rate of breathing. most people with copd breathe comfortably while resting. during exertion though breaths start coming in before air from the last breath has been exhaled and shortness of breath results. in people with heart failure the heart does not pump blood efficiently. as in copd most people with heart failure can breathe easily when at rest. with activity blood flow must increase and the heart must pump harder and faster. if the heart cant keep up blood backs up into the lungs. this fluid congestion causes shortness of breath.,"['congestive heart failure', 'chronic obstructive pulmonary disease']",wmd

a free blood screening = bun of 21; my creatinine serum was 0. 93; and my bun/creatinine ratio was 23. do i call dr.?,"well let's start at the beginning. i'll include some links to more information. the bun (blood urea nitrogen) test basically is used to give an idea of how well your kidneys are working. a ""normal"" bun range for adults is around 6-20 mg/dl. the fact your bun is 21 isn't necessarily reason for concern. many factors (including various medications) can affect the bun result and 21 might even be normal for you. it's hard to say without some past lab results to compare with. serum creatinine ranges in adult men run from about 0. 6-1. 2 mg/dl and for women the range is around 0. 4-1. 0. so it sounds like your creatinine level is within normal limits. a normal bun:creatinine ratio is considered to be 10:1-20:1. your bun/creatinine ratio is slightly elevated but probably no cause for alarm. however your best bet is always to consult a health care provider to discuss these results. what's normal for one person may not be normal for another. that's why we health professionals recommend you get blood work done every year. by comparing past results with current ones we can get a better idea of whether you have a problem developing that needs treatment. since i have no background information on you specifically it's impossible to say if these results deserve further investigation. if you're at all concerned about them you should visit your primary care provider. best wishes to you! no","['creatinine', 'screening']",wmd
what is the predicted maximal heart rate for women?,the good old-fashioned exercise treadmill test remains one of the most powerful diagnostic tests we have to assess a persons cardiovascular risk. a stress test typically consists of a brisk walk on a treadmill according to a protocol of increasing speed and elevation. electrocardiographic monitoring documents abnormal heart rhythms and other indicators that your heart is under stress from lack of oxygen during exercise. these more sophisticated measurements coupled with simpler signs like heart rate blood pressure and exercise duration help your doctor better understand your level of fitness and your risk of having coronary artery disease. but the latest research suggests that we havent been doing it entirely the right way for about half of the population. you have probably heard that if you subtract your age from 220 you will get your predicted maximal heart rate. that is if youre a man. the research studies that gave us this equation were performed on men back in the 1970s. and like many studies performed on men (and like many things in the 1970s in general) the results dont always apply to women today. so a group of researchers at northwestern university decided to tackle this question by monitoring exercise tests in over 5 000 women and looked for correlations between heart rate and increasing risk for heart attacks. their data resulted in a new improved and gender-appropriate calculation of 206 minus 0. 88 of a womens age to predict maximal heart rate. the changes between the old and the new calculations might result in small differences in the peak heart rates doctors might expect you to achieve or the targets that might be used in exercise testing or even when youre at the gym. its interesting information but is it useful? for years stress tests have been used to estimate cardiovascular risk with excellent track records in both women and men despite using the same calculations. occasionally a stress test is considered suboptimal or less diagnostic if a person does not achieve a particular heart rate. now that the threshold is different this may result in more conclusive tests. but how should this impact your workout? while treadmills and elliptical machines present information about heart rate and zones for fat burning and cardiovascular training  the reality is that tailoring your workout to your heart rate is not as important as tailoring it to how you feel. you can have an excellent workout at a lower or higher heart rate depending on what you do and how long you are doing it. and tailoring your workout to your age (by using the heart rate calculation) just seems sort of depressing. the bottom line is that you should exercise consistently and to the best of your ability â€” regardless of your heart rate age or sex. competitive athletes and gadget hounds will find this new information helpful in gauging the intensity of a particular workout but for the rest of us the most important calculation is how to find time to get to the gym in the first place.,['pulse'],wmd

what is a normal platelet count?,platelets are the tiny blood cells that help stop bleeding by binding together to form a clump or plug at sites of injury inside blood vessels. a normal platelet count is between 150 000 and 450 000 platelets per microliter (one-millionth of a liter abbreviated mcl). the average platelet count is 237 000 per mcl in men and 266 000 per mcl in women. a platelet count below 150 000 per mcl is called thrombocytopenia while a platelet count over 450 000 is called thrombocytosis. platelets seem to have a large backup capacity: blood typically still clots normally as long as the platelet count is above 50 000 per mcl (assuming no other problems are present). spontaneous bleeding doesnt usually occur unless the platelet count falls to 10 000 or 20 000 per mcl. platelets are constantly being produced in the bone marrow. a low or high platelet count is not often a problem by itself but can frequently be a sign of another medical condition. for this reason high or low platelet counts require additional medical attention. 329,['platelet'],wmd

what is bikram yoga?,bikram yoga is a form of yoga developed by bikram choudhury. in this practice the classroom is heated to 105 degrees fahrenheit and 40% humidity. from there students perform 26 postures and 2 breathing exercises over 90 minutes specifically selected by choudhury to improve health and stamina. the classes are highly structured and poses are performed in an exact sequence every time and repeated twice. many people praise this form of yoga and i have found it very beneficial. however not everyone is a proponent of this training. many health professionals contend that stretching in extreme heat increases your chances of injury. muscles and other connective tissues warmed by the high room temperature allow you to stretch well beyond normal limits. furthermore exercising in extreme heat significantly increases chances of dehydration and places a huge stress on the cardiovascular system that could be harmful to some people. if youre interested in this form of yoga its important to keep three things in mind. one this is a very physically demanding form of exercise and is not for everyone. two if you have any previous injuries or health conditions ask your doctor if this type of training is appropriate for you. three remember bikram yoga is not the only form of yoga available. numerous studies involving all types of yoga (ananda ashtanga and iyengar) can improve your health.,[],wmd

what are the different kinds of epilepsy?,"just as there are many different kinds of seizures there are many different kinds of epilepsy. doctors have identified hundreds of different epilepsy syndromes  disorders characterized by a specific set of symptoms that include epilepsy. some of these syndromes appear to be hereditary. for other syndromes the cause is unknown. epilepsy syndromes are frequently described by their symptoms or by where in the brain they originate. people should discuss the implications of their type of epilepsy with their doctors to understand the full range of symptoms the possible treatments and the prognosis. people with absence epilepsy have repeated absence seizures that cause momentary lapses of consciousness. these seizures almost always begin in childhood or adolescence and they tend to run in families suggesting that they may be at least partially due to a defective gene or genes. some people with absence seizures have purposeless movements during their seizures such as a jerking arm or rapidly blinking eyes. others have no noticeable symptoms except for brief times when they are ""out of it. "" immediately after a seizure the person can resume whatever he or she was doing. however these seizures may occur so frequently that the person cannot concentrate in school or other situations. childhood absence epilepsy usually stops when the child reaches puberty. absence seizures usually have no lasting effect on intelligence or other brain functions. temporal lobe epilepsy or tle is the most common epilepsy syndrome with focal seizures. these seizures are often associated with auras. tle often begins in childhood. research has shown that repeated temporal lobe seizures can cause a brain structure called the hippocampus to shrink over time. the hippocampus is important for memory and learning. while it may take years of temporal lobe seizures for measurable hippocampal damage to occur this finding underlines the need to treat tle early and as effectively as possible. neocortical epilepsy is characterized by seizures that originate from the brain's cortex or outer layer. the seizures can be either focal or generalized. they may include strange sensations visual hallucinations emotional changes muscle spasms convulsions and a variety of other symptoms depending on where in the brain the seizures originate. there are many other types of epilepsy each with its own characteristic set of symptoms. many of these including lennox-gastaut syndrome and rasmussen's encephalitis begin in childhood. children with lennox-gastaut syndrome have severe epilepsy with several different types of seizures including atonic seizures which cause sudden falls and are also called drop attacks. this severe form of epilepsy can be very difficult to treat effectively. rasmussen's encephalitis is a progressive type of epilepsy in which half of the brain shows continual inflammation. it sometimes is treated with a radical surgical procedure called hemispherectomy. some childhood epilepsy syndromes such as childhood absence epilepsy tend to go into remission or stop entirely during adolescence whereas other syndromes such as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and lennox-gastaut syndrome are usually present for life once they develop. seizure syndromes do not always appear in childhood however. epilepsy syndromes that are easily treated do not seem to impair cognitive functions or development and usually stop spontaneously are often described as benign. benign epilepsy syndromes include benign infantile encephalopathy and benign neonatal convulsions. other syndromes such as early myoclonic encephalopathy include neurological and developmental problems. however these problems may be caused by underlying neurodegenerative processes rather than by the seizures. epilepsy syndromes in which the seizures and/or the person's cognitive abilities get worse over time are called progressive epilepsy. several types of epilepsy begin in infancy. the most common type of infantile epilepsy is infantile spasms clusters of seizures that usually begin before the age of 6 months. during these seizures the infant may bend and cry out. anticonvulsant drugs often do not work for infantile spasms but the seizures can be treated with acth (adrenocorticotropic hormone) or prednisone.",['epilepsy'],wmd
can any advertised device reduce my sagging skin?,a friend from long island and thus always a great skeptic sent me an advertisement from an airline magazine. apparently the face trainer is a helmet-mask device that works out facial muscles for a natural looking lip.  the advertisement says no creams no injections no fuss â€“ just 10 minutes a day and your face trainer is all you need to look younger and healthier.  the advertisement further states in a 60-day clinical trial participants achieved 71% reduction in sagging skin.  i found that quite amazing but im not sure what the clinical trial was. i wonder if i asked for a copy of this clinical trial if they would have one for me. i certainly did not see anything about it in a recognized medical journal. if any product were that good you can bet i would know about it by now. i wish life was that easy where all we had to do was wear a device and somehow our anatomy magically changes. our skin would look younger become tighter and all sags and bags would just go away. wow! this would be real progress. sometimes i find these types of advertisements offensive because they demean the intelligence of the reader. despite the proclamation that products like this will give your face a lift without needles or knives  dont expect a miracle. and those well-chosen words without needles or knives are deliberately crafted by the writer of the ad to incite terror in the readers brain. to scare you so that you make the emotional part of your brain believe this device can do what the common sense part of your brain says it cannot do. remember when something seems too good to be true it usually is.,['skin'],wmd

what are lice?,lice are tiny parasites that live on human beings and feed on blood. they seldom cause serious medical problems but they are both annoying and contagious. there are three types of lice that can live on people. head lice ( pediculus humanus capitis ) are about the size of a sesame seed or 2. 1 to 3. 3 millimeters long when adults. their eggs called nits are barely visible whitish or yellow ovals which attach to human hair shafts. having head lice isn't related to degree of personal hygiene. head lice are contagious especially among schoolchildren. they afflict an estimated 6 million to 12 million children in the united states each year. more girls get head lice  likely because girls have more physical contact with one another and share more personal articles (such as hats clothing combs) that can transmit head lice. head lice are rare among african-americans possibly because the shafts of their hair have a shape that lice cannot grasp easily. pubic lice ( pthirus pubis ) are yellow-gray insects found in the pubic region and transmitted by sexual contact. they are only 1. 1 to 1. 8 mm long and are also called crab lice or crabs because of their shape and the crab-like claw-like front legs with which they cling to hair. eggs can barely be seen; these tiny white particles attach so firmly to hair shafts that they are not removed by normal washing. sometimes pubic lice may be found in other areas of the body containing coarse hair such as armpits or the chest. body lice ( pediculus humanus corporis ) are nearly identical in appearance to head lice but may be more difficult to find. adults grow to 2. 3 to 3. 6 mm long. when not feeding they tend to hide in the seams of clothing and folds of bedding. if the lice are not treated the person can develop complications such as skin sores or bacterial infection of the affected area. body lice can also spread blood infections. lice live successfully all over the world wherever people gather in close proximity such as in schools.,['lice'],wmd

is a spacer needed to effectively use an inhaler?,spacers are great tools especially with inhalers lately. many people have had changes in their inhalers. the older inhalers used a different type of gas or what we called a cfc gas. that was actually banned last year due to environmental laws. so inhalers that people would use for their asthma have actually changed and now theyll see the letters hfa after them. there are some differences and one of the biggest ones is the fact that the spray comes out differently. so ive had a lot of patients come back telling me that their medication doesnt work or well the other thing i found out is that theyre not really using their inhaler the right way. they have to retrain themselves. the spacers a great opportunity especially for children or older adults who may not have a steady hand and cant coordinate their breathing the right way. its a plastic tube and you put the inhaler on one end and your mouth on the other and when you spray it the medication goes into this chamber and therefore you can breathe in and out and get your breathing down; so therefore the medication travels to where it needs to go. its well worth the money. i know sometimes a lot of people dont wanna purchase it because its usually not covered under insurance; but theyre washable and theyre really great and with the kids they come with a little fun mask or little you know cartoons on it to make it seem like you know its not this traumatic experience. but they really do benefit in helping people get the right amount of medication.,['inhaler'],wmd

what health consequences will i face because of my meal plan for my eating disorder and the desserts that i eat nightly? . i am currently recovering from an eating disorder and have to follow a meal plan. sadly this requires me to eat dessert every night. i have been doing so since about mid-february. i am a fitness and nutrition fanatic (this did not help in developing an) and i have a major fear of suffering health consequences due to the fact that i am forced to eat sugary desserts every night. is there any health repercussions? what should i do?,most helpful answer the important thing is that you understand why the dessert is in your meal plan. talking with your therapist is key because he or she is likely doing it to help change your relationship with food. the tendency with eating disorders/disordered eating is people give too much power to a single food instead of looking at the overall pattern of eating. as for your health no eating a sweet food everyday will not ruin your health (i do it! ) especially when your diet is balanced. it's the extremes that are harmful  eating sweets/chips/empty calorie foods all day long or eliminating so many foods/items that it's hard to maintain a healthy weight and enjoy eating. i hope that helps. good luck on your journey!,"['meal', 'eating disorder', 'dessert', 'fitness', 'nutrition']",wmd

how do doctors diagnose osteoarthritis?,no single test can diagnose osteoarthritis. most doctors use a combination of the following methods to diagnose the disease and rule out other conditions: clinical history the doctor begins by asking the patient to describe the symptoms and when and how the condition started as well as how the symptoms have changed over time. the doctor will also ask about any other medical problems the patient and close family members have and about any medications the patient is taking. accurate answers to these questions can help the doctor make a diagnosis and understand the impact the disease has on your life. physical examination the doctor will check the patients reflexes and general health including muscle strength. the doctor will also examine bothersome joints and observe the patients ability to walk bend and carry out activities of daily living. x rays doctors take x rays to see how much joint damage has been done. x rays of the affected joint can show such things as cartilage loss bone damage and bone spurs. but there often is a big difference between the severity of osteoarthritis as shown by the x ray and the degree of pain and disability felt by the patient. also x rays may not show early osteoarthritis damage before much cartilage loss has taken place. magnetic resonance imaging also known as an mri magnetic resonance imaging provides high-resolution computerized images of internal body tissues. this procedure uses a strong magnet that passes a force through the body to create these images. doctors often use mri tests if there is pain; if x-ray findings are minimal; and if the findings suggest damage to other joint tissues such as a ligament or the pad of connective tissue in the knee known as the meniscus. other tests the doctor may order blood tests to rule out other causes of symptoms. he or she may also order a joint aspiration which involves drawing fluid from the joint through a needle and examining the fluid under a microscope.,['osteoarthritis'],wmd

can chickenpox be prevented with a vaccine?,most people develop lifetime immunity to chickenpox after the first occurrence and never experience it again. but the virus can sometimes resurface later in life as shingles (zoster). the current aim in the u. s. and many other countries is to achieve universal (or nearly universal) immunization of children with the chickenpox vaccine. the vaccination requires only two shots. the first vaccination is given at about 1 year of age and the second (booster) is given at 4 years of age. if an older person has not had chickenpox the shot may be given at any time. there have been few significant adverse reactions to the chickenpox vaccine. all children except those with a compromised immune system should have the vaccination. vaccination has been associated with a 90% decrease in the incidence of chickenpox and significantly lower complication rates in those who do develop the symptoms.,['chickenpox'],wmd

what do you do for c diff?,"clostridium difficile (or c. diff ) is a bacterium that lives naturally in the human gut. however usually when people refer to "" c. diff "" they're referring to c. diff colitis which is an infectious diarrhea caused when c. diff bacteria grow unchecked. the most common cause of c. diff colitis is disruption of the normal balance of bacteria in the gut due to taking antibiotics. it's important to understand c. diff is highly contagious. it spreads through direct contact. so if a person has c. diff diarrhea and soils the bedding which then touches the nightstand as you're taking the sheets off the bed you can pick up the c. diff bacteria from the nightstand and become infected yourself. c. diff colitis is a nasty condition. it's painful and annoying (all those bathroom trips). beyond the annoyance it can cause life-threatening dehydration in children and the elderly. any time a person gets diarrhea that persists after finishing a course of antibiotics they should consult their medical provider to determine if they have a case of c. diff. c. diff usually is treated with one or more courses of oral antibiotics. other therapies may include fluids (to avoid dehydration) and probiotic supplements to help restore the balance of flora in the gut. if you suspect you or a loved one has c. diff colitis it's imperative you avoid spreading it. you must use alcohol-based hand rub every time you go to the bathroom or have contact with a person who has c. diff. washing your hands with soap and water will not kill this bacterium. wear medical gloves when dealing with soiled linen  and also use hand rub. you also need to wash bedding towels and even clothing in hot water preferably with chlorine bleach. i sincerely hope neither you nor a loved one ever has to experience a c. diff infection. wishing you well!",[],wmd

how can i prevent high blood pressure?,you can prevent high blood pressure by: maintaining a healthy weight. getting regular exercise. reducing salt intake. drinking alcohol in moderation if at all. reducing stress. other things like dietary supplements may also help prevent high blood pressure. here's a roundup of what's being said about them. potassium. eating foods rich in potassium will help protect some people from developing high blood pressure. calcium. populations with low calcium intakes have high rates of high blood pressure. however it has not been proven that taking calcium tablets will prevent high blood pressure. but it is important to be sure to get at least the recommended amount of calcium from the foods you eat. dairy foods like low-fat selections of milk yogurt and cheese are good sources of calcium. magnesium. a diet low in magnesium may make your blood pressure rise. but doctors don't recommend taking extra magnesium to help prevent high blood pressure  the amount you get in a healthy diet is enough. magnesium is found in whole grains green leafy vegetables nuts seeds and dry peas and beans. fish oils. a type of fat called omega-3 fatty acids is found in fatty fish like mackerel and salmon. large amounts of fish oils may help reduce high blood pressure but their role in prevention is unclear. taking fish oil pills is not recommended because high doses can cause unpleasant side effects. the pills are also high in fat and calories. of course most fish if not fried or made with added fat is low in saturated fat and calories and can be eaten often. garlic. there has been some evidence to suggest garlics effect in lowering blood pressure in addition to improving cholesterol and reducing some cancers. always talk to your doctor before taking a dietary supplement or alternative herbal treatment. some may interact with other medications you may be taking or have harmful side effects.,['high blood pressure'],wmd

what can be done to prevent hpv transmission to my partner? what are the risks if he is infected? . hello . i found out i have hpv from an abnormal pap smear. however i do not have genital warts or any external symptoms. i am currently in a monogamous relationship with a man. i was wondering what type of precautions should be taken to prevent spreading the disease to him and what are the risks if the disease is transmitted to him? i know it slightly increases the risks of some cancers in men but is there anything else to be concerned about? . thank you,first i'm sorry to hear you have been diagnosed with human papillomavirus (hpv) but i'm glad to hear you're getting regular pap smears. unfortunately your partner may already be infected. even without external genital warts or other symptoms you can spread the virus through mere contact during sexual intercourse. and use of a condom isn't necessarily protective either since a condom doesn't cover all the skin areas that may come in contact with the virus. the good news is that serious complications or cancers from hpv in heterosexual men with healthy immune systems is rare. in fact in both your cases the virus may clear up on its own over the course of a couple of years. (though this is less likely if you're passing it back and forth. ) both you and your boyfriend should be alert for signs of genital warts on his penis or scrotum. if you notice anything resembling genital warts he should try to see a doctor for a diagnosis. really the only way to diagnose hpv in men is through physical examination during an outbreak of the warts. if you have additional questions about this don't hesitate to ask your gynecologist. hpv is incredibly common. it's estimated that up to 50% of sexually active men and women will contract hpv at some point in their lives. take care!,"['human papillomavirus', 'wart', 'cancer', 'pap test']",wmd

should i hold off on weight training until i lose weight?,absolutely not. lifting weights will not only help you lose weight but maintain the loss. here's why: muscle keeps your metabolism revved up burning calories fat and glucose (sugar). when you lose weight up to 25% of the loss may come from muscle resulting in a slower metabolism. weight lifting will help preserve or rebuild any muscle you lose by dieting. muscle helps you with aerobic exercise. the stronger you are the better you will be at any aerobic activity. weight training improves your body's muscle-to-fat ratio (you end up with less body fat and more muscle) which improves both your health and your fitness level. gaining muscle will help you look better as you define and tone your physique. building strength helps you feel good about yourself. although the scale may show a slight weight gain when you start lifting weights (usually five pounds or less) you probably won't look heavier because the gain is in muscle and your clothes may even fit more loosely. strength training along with cardiovascular exercise can boost your metabolism and can help you expend calories to lose weight. strength training however also has the added benefit of helping you to preserve muscle as well. if you lose weight while only doing cardiovascular exercise some of the weight loss may come from body fat as well as muscle. you want to preserve muscle because it can help to keep your metabolism elevated since muscle burns calories at a higher rate than fat. strength training can also help to promote a more toned appearance which would be another added benefit to you as well. the surgeon general recommends that you strength train all major muscle groups two or more days per week. consult your doctor before starting an exercise routine. no you should remaind that it's a continuous process. if you stop it your weight will start increasing.,"['weight', 'diet']",wmd

when should my child's sickness keep her home and when can i send her to school?,generally speaking she can be around other kids once her fever has been gone for 24 hours and she is feeling better. if your child has been placed on an antibiotic for any reason she should receive the medication for at least 24 hours before being around other children. if you kept your child home every time he had the sniffles he'd never be in school. and the older he gets the harder it is to make up missed schoolwork. so if he feels okay and doesn't have a fever he should be in school. but if your child has a fever (temperature over 100. 3) is vomiting having bad diarrhea coughing up a storm has pain interfering with activity or really isn't feeling well keep him at home until these symptoms are under control. often it's the milder symptoms (such as slight runny nose and cough) that leave parents wondering what to do. only you can make that game-day decision but be considerate of others. before you take him out think to yourself would i want another child with the same symptoms around my son? you can always check with your child care or preschool. they may have specific guidelines for when previously sick children can return. you know your child best so if you think something is wrong don't send him to school. if you're concerned call your pediatrician.,[],wmd

if you have unprotected sex on nov 3 is it possible to tell with a home test that you are pregnant on the 18th?,the answer to this question lies in your individual menstrual cycle. depending on the brand (you need to read the box) you can take a home pregnancy test as early as a day after you miss your period. some tests claim you can test 3 to 4 days before you miss your period but testing too soon can give you a false negative result. it may be better to wait the few extra days to see if you miss your period and then test. for best results i suggest taking the test first thing in the morning when your urine is most concentrated. home pregnancy tests measure the level of human chorionic gonadatropin (hcg) in your urine. this hormone is produced in great quantities beginning shortly after fertilization of an egg occurs. by taking the pregnancy test first thing in the morning you ensure any hcg in your urine is very concentrated and easy for the test to detect. so step one: wait until you miss your period. step two: home pregnancy test. hope this helps!,['pregnancy'],wmd

how can rh sensitization during pregnancy be prevented?,if you are rh-negative and pregnant if you are an rh-negative woman and you have conceived with an rh-negative partner you are not at risk of rh sensitization during pregnancy. (most health professionals treat all rh-negative pregnant women as though the father might be rh-positive. ) if you are already sensitized to the rh factor your pregnancy will need to be closely monitored to prevent fetal harm. for more information on fetal and newborn treatment see the treatment overview section of this topic. if you are unsensitized rh-negative treatment focuses on preventing rh sensitization during pregnancy and childbirth. rh immune globulin (such as rhogam) is a highly effective treatment for preventing sensitization. to prevent sensitization from occurring late in the pregnancy or during delivery you must have a shot of rh immune globulin around week 28 of your pregnancy. this treatment prevents your immune system from making antibodies against your fetus's rh-positive red blood cells. rh immune globulin injection is also necessary if you have had any vaginal bleeding or an obstetric procedure such as amniocentesis or external cephalic version. if your newborn is rh-positive you are given rh immune globulin again within 72 hours of delivery. by preventing rh sensitization from delivery you are protecting your next rh-positive fetus. if your newborn is rh-negative sensitization cannot happen and no treatment is necessary. rh immune globulin is also necessary after a miscarriage partial molar pregnancy ectopic pregnancy or abortion. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

why do i faint or nearly faint after taking a shower?,that's a very interesting question and i'm glad you asked! being a perioperative nurse i've informed many patients on how to care for themselves when they get home. one piece of advice i usually give is this: don't jump into a hot shower right away. why? because it can cause a quick shift of your body fluids into your legs. if that happens it can cause your blood pressure to drop which can result in lightheadedness or even fainting. even if you haven't had surgery this fluid shift can occur from taking hot showers. you can test this theory yourself by seeing if you feel faint after taking a cooler shower. if not problem solved! meanwhile remember: safety first! if you've been feeling lightheaded after showering you need to make sure to use a shower stool or grab bars to keep yourself from falling. whenever you feel lightheaded (whether in the shower or not) your best bet is to sit down as quickly as possible. sitting down is better than falling down! if your symptoms persist you should consult a health care professional for a physical exam. wishing you well!,['lightheadedness'],wmd

what is the difference between prescription protonix 40 mg and ranitidine 150 mg an over-the-counter medicine?,protonix and ranitidine can both be used to treat gi ulcers gerd maintenance therapy for ulcer prevention and heartburn. both of these medications block acid production by two different mechanisms. protonix is a proton pump inhibitor while ranitidine prevents gastric acid stimulation by blocking histamine release in the stomach. protonix is prescription strength while ranitidine is over-the-counter. this means that there could be a price difference depending on the co-pays with your health insurance. protonix does have a generic (pantoprazole) that is equally effective as the brand name. if you are thinking about switching without knowing the severity of your stomach condition is it hard to give information as to whether ranitidine can be supplemented for protonix. i recommend that you speak to your health-care provider about your options. these medications do work differently and the effectiveness can be different. if the symptoms have subsided keep in mind that the medication can be the controlling factor. therefore it may not be necessary to switch if your current treatment is working for you.,"['over the counter', 'drug']",wmd

what causes epilepsy?,epilepsy may develop even though you do not have any risk factors. a cause cannot always be identified. this is especially true in many forms of childhood epilepsy. for some people epilepsy can result from a tumor infection or damage to the brain. children and older adults are most likely to develop epilepsy but it can start at any age. it is possible that epilepsy may run in families but you do not have to have a family history to develop epilepsy. epileptic seizures occur when abnormal bursts of electricity in the brain briefly upset normal brain function. it's not always clear what triggers the bursts of abnormal electrical activity. conditions that can cause seizures include: head injury. stroke or conditions that affect the blood vessels (vascular system) in the brain. hardening of the arteries ( atherosclerosis ) in the brain. brain tumor. brain infection such as meningitis or encephalitis. alzheimer's disease. alcohol or drug abuse or withdrawal. tumors scar tissue from injury or disease or abnormal brain development may damage a specific area of the brain and cause partial seizures. but you may not have any of these conditions and still develop epilepsy. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

how does osteoporosis occur?,bone is constantly being remodeled. this is the natural healthy state of continuous uptake of old bone (resorption) followed by the deposit of new bone. this turnover is important in keeping bones healthy and in repairing any minor damage that may occur with wear and tear. the cells that lay new bone down are called osteoblasts and the cells responsible for resorption of old bone are called osteoclasts. osteoporosis occurs as a result of a mismatch between osteoclast and osteoblast activity. this mismatch can be caused by many different disease states or hormonal changes. it is also commonly a result of aging the change in normal hormones that occurs after menopause and from diets low in calcium and vitamin d. in osteoporosis osteoclasts outperform osteoblasts so that more bone is taken up than is laid down. the result is a thinning of the bone with an accompanying loss in bone strength and a greater risk of fracture. a thinning bone results in a lower bone density or bone mass. there are two major types of bone. cancellous bone (also known as trabecular bone) is the inner softer portion of the bone and cortical bone is the outer harder layer of bone. cancellous bone undergoes turnover at a faster rate than cortical bone. as a result if osteoclast and osteoblast activity becomes mismatched cancellous bone is affected more rapidly than cortical bone. certain areas in the body have a higher ratio of cancellous bone to cortical bone such as the spine (vertebrae) the wrist (distal radius) and the hips (femoral neck). most of a person's bone mass is achieved by early adulthood. after that time the bone mass gradually declines throughout the rest of a person's life. there is a normal rate of decline in bone mass with age in both men and women. for women in addition to age the menopause transition itself causes an extra degree of bone loss. this bone loss is greatest in the first three to six years after menopause. women can lose up to 20% of their total bone mass during this time. since women generally have a lower bone mass to begin with in comparison with men the ultimate result is a higher risk of fracture in postmenopausal women as compared to men of the same age. nevertheless it is important to remember that men may also be at risk for osteoporosis especially if they have certain illnesses a low testosterone level are smokers take certain medications or are sedentary. the best method to prevent osteoporosis is to achieve as high a bone mass by early adulthood with a proper diet and regular exercise. unfortunately osteoporosis is not often considered during this time in a person's life.,['osteoporosis'],wmd

"" you may have torn or strained this. also the ulnar nerve is located in the area you injured. if you are experiencing tingling in your pinky finger you may have damaged this nerve. of course there are several ligaments in the elbow that could have been injured as well. if rest doesn't resolve your pain and any other symptoms within a few days it would be worth getting checked out by a doctor. the elbow is a complex joint and you don't want to risk long-term damage by trying to ""wait out"" what could be a treatable injury. best of luck to you!",['elbow'],wmd

my son is urinating frequently but only at night. no pain with it. what could cause this?,i don't know the age of your son or if he is having bedwetting issues but frequent night-time urination could be due to many things. for instance if he has a tendency to over-drink liquids in the evening he would more likely need to urinate throughout the night. sometimes little a boy will get irritation of their penis from soaps (not rinsed well after a bath or shower) laundry detergent or dryer softener residuals left in their clothing etc. this can cause an irritant urethritis that makes him feel like he needs to urinate. less common but not out of the question would be a child who is developing diabetes (type 1). it would be wise to discuss this with his medical provider and have some lab tests. another possibility could be a deficiency of a natural hormone called adh (anti-diuretic hormone). the hormone is supposed to keep us from urinating often at night so if there is a deficiency the body will continue to process urine like we were awake during the day. this is one cause of nocturnal enuresis otherwise known as bedwetting. he could potentially be a bed-wetter but instead is just waking up multiple times to urinate; perhaps not sleeping well for fear that he will wet his pants or the bed. if he does have an adh deficiency this can be corrected by a medication called desmopressin (ddavp). his medical provider will be able to determine if this would be helpful. get him in to see his medical provider.,"['urination', 'pain']",wmd

what does it mean if a food product is labeled light  low  reduced  or fat-free? ,"the fda sets rules for what food manufacturers can call ""light "" ""low "" ""reduced "" ""free "" and other food terms. here's the low-down on these terms: ""healthy"" food must be low in fat with limited cholesterol and sodium. anything labeled ""free"" must only contain tiny amounts of the ingredient in each serving. for example ""trans-fat free"" or ""fat-free"" products can have only 0. 5 mg of trans fats or fat; ""cholesterol-free"" foods can only have two milligrams of cholesterol and two grams of saturated fat. a serving of food labeled ""low sodium"" can have a maximum of 140 milligrams of sodium. a serving of ""low cholesterol"" food can have a maximum of 20 milligrams of cholesterol and two grams of saturated fat. one serving of a ""low-fat"" food can have a maximum of three grams of fat. a serving of a ""low-calorie"" food can have a maximum of 40 calories. a serving of a food labeled ""reduced"" must have 25% less of the ingredient than a serving of the regular version. one serving of a ""light"" food must have 50% less fat or 1/3 fewer calories than the regular version. the food and drug administration (fda) regulates what claims a product can make. the following are a few examples to answer your question: - free. this term means that a product contains no amount of or only trivial or ""physiologically inconsequential"" amounts of one or more of these components: fat saturated fat cholesterol sodium sugars and calories. - low. this term can be used on foods that can be eaten frequently without exceeding dietary guidelines for one or more of these components: fat saturated fat cholesterol sodium and calories. - low-fat : 3 g or less per serving - low-saturated fat : 1 g or less per serving - low-sodium : 140 mg or less per serving - very low sodium : 35 mg or less per serving - low-calorie : 40 calories or less per serving. - low-cholesterol : 20 mg or less and 2 g or less of saturated fat per serving - reduced. this term means that a nutritionally altered product contains at least 25 percent less of a nutrient or of calories than the regular or reference product. however a reduced claim can't be made on a product if its reference food already meets the requirement for a ""low"" claim. - light. this descriptor can mean two things: - that a nutritionally altered product contains one-third fewer calories or half the fat of the reference food. - that the sodium content of a low-calorie low-fat food has been reduced by 50 percent.",['food'],wmd
how can i prevent salmonella in my kitchen  and my life?,eggs have been making the news lately with three major nationwide recalls due to potential contamination with the bacteria salmonella. the recalls involve eggs from wright county and hillandale farms in iowa. but whats the big cluck about it? well if you handle these eggs or eat them partially cooked (a. k. a. poached or soft boiled) you can potentially get pretty sick. salmonella (specifically salmonella enteriditis) is the most common form of bacterial food poisoning. within 12 hours to 3 days after an exposure people develop nasty diarrhea vomiting fever and stomach cramps. unlike the watery diarrhea one typically sees with a stomach virus salmonella usually causes diarrhea mixed with mucus and/or blood. and this lovely infection lasts up to a week. ugh. the good news is that most people fully recover without needing any special treatment or medication. some unlucky people can get dehydrated and end up being hospitalized. and a few very unlucky people can be seriously ill from this infection. that includes young infants people with weakened immune systems and the elderly. besides this iowa egg issue there are other ways to get this bug. so how do you avoid getting salmonella and other forms of food poisoning? 1. make sure to thoroughly wash countertops sinks and cutting boards with soap and water when preparing foods with eggs raw meat or poultry. 2. only prepare fully cooked eggs. 3. make sure hamburger/ground beef is cooked completely until it is brown. yes pink makes a juicier burger but it also makes a germ-filled one. 4. use pasteurized eggs in recipes that call for raw eggs (like caesar salad dressing). 5. keep eggs meat and poultry properly refrigerated. 6. keep all baby bottles pacifiers and breast pump supplies away from food preparation areas. 7. keep pet iguanas or turtles out of the kitchen counter area. (you think i am joking i had a patient get salmonella this way). make sure to wash hands thoroughly after handling. 8. buy only pasteurized apple cider and other juice products. 9. wash hands thoroughly after visiting a petting zoo. take home tip: if you or a family develops diarrhea that is bloody or mucousy its time to call your doctor.,[],wmd

what are the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia bph?,many men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) have no symptoms. when symptoms (known as lower urinary tract symptoms or luts) occur they may range from mild and barely noticeable to serious and disruptive. the amount of prostate enlargement is not always related to the severity of the symptoms. some men with only slight enlargement have serious symptoms and some men with a great deal of enlargement have few symptoms. your symptoms may become worse during cold weather or as a result of physical or emotional stress. some medicines can make your symptoms worse. these include over-the-counter cold medicines such as diphenhydramine hydrochloride ( benadryl for example) pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (such as sudafed ) oxymetazoline spray (such as afrin ) and prescription medicines such as antidepressants water pills (diuretics) testosterone (gels implants or injections) and pain medicines (narcotics). the symptoms of bph may involve problems emptying the bladder or problems with bladder storage. symptoms related to bladder emptying include: difficulty starting a urine stream (hesitancy and straining). decreased strength of the urine stream (weak flow). dribbling after urination. feeling that the bladder is not completely empty. an urge to urinate again soon after urinating. pain during urination (dysuria). symptoms related to bladder storage include: waking at night to urinate (nocturia). frequent urination. a sudden uncontrollable urge to urinate. these symptoms are not always related to prostate enlargement and can be caused by other conditions. bph symptoms are often balanced between the two types of symptoms. if symptoms come on rapidly or if you have more of one type of symptom than the other type you may have another condition. other conditions that may cause similar symptoms include urinary tract infections prostatitis prostate cancer diabetes heart failure and neurologic diseases. you can use the interactive tool: how bad are your urinary symptoms from bph? to evaluate how bad your symptoms are and later to judge how well your treatment is working. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

how can i deal with constipation during pregnancy?,constipation is a common problem that pregnant women have. and there are some things that they can do to help ease the constipation. the first thing is to probably change their diet. i am sure it's not something that a pregnant mom wants to hear because they want to have certain foods but by increasing your fibre intake having more fruit juices fresh fruit more water. water is a great substance that can actually help you ease your constipation. a lot of times pregnant moms are dehydrated because of the fact that they are not drinking enough during the day. so by making these little changes it will help. some minimal exercise. walking around a little bit more actually does a lot of great in helping constipation. there are stool softeners that are available. the common product is docusate sodium and that can be used by pregnant women but i would definitely recommend as a pharmacist that a pregnant woman check with their ob/gyn or healthcare provider first before starting that type of therapy.,"['constipation', 'pregnancy']",wmd
what does having a clear discharge during pregnancy mean?,hi yes. almost all women have more vaginal discharge in pregnancy. this is quite normal and happens for a few reasons. during pregnancy the cervix (neck of the womb) and vaginal walls get softer and discharge increases to help prevent any infections travelling up from the vagina to the womb. towards the end of pregnancy the amount of discharge increases and can be confused with urine. in the last week or so of pregnancy your discharge may contain streaks of thick mucus and some blood. this is called a 'show' and happens when the mucus that has been present in your cervix during pregnancy comes away. it's a sign that the body is starting to prepare for birth and you may have a few small 'shows' in the days before you go into labour. increased discharge is a normal part of pregnancy but it's important to keep an eye on it and tell your doctor or midwife if it changes in any way. do hope this helps you. good luck,['pregnancy'],wmd

what is the treatment for hives?,the goal of treating most cases of ordinary urticaria is to relieve symptoms while the condition goes away by itself. the most commonly used oral treatments are antihistamines which help oppose the effects of the histamine leaked by mast cells. the main side effect of antihistamines is drowsiness. many antihistamines are available without prescription such as diphenhydramine (benadryl) taken in doses of 25 milligrams and chlorpheniramine (chlor-trimeton) taken in a dose of 4 milligrams. these can be taken up to three times a day but because these medications can cause drowsiness they are often taken at bedtime. those who take them should be especially careful and be sure they are fully alert before driving or participating in other activities requiring mental concentration. loratadine (claritin 10 milligrams) is an antihistamine available over the counter that is less likely to cause drowsiness. also approved for over-the-counter use is hydroxyzine (atarax vistaril) which causes drowsiness and its breakdown product cetirizine (zyrtec 10 milligrams) which is mildly sedating. antihistamines that require a prescription include cyproheptadine (periactin) which tends to cause drowsiness. prescription antihistamines that cause little sedation are fexofenadine (allegra) and levocetirizine (xyzal). sometimes physicians combine these with other types of antihistamines called h2 blockers such as ranitidine (zantac) and cimetidine (tagamet). this antihistamine list is not exhaustive. physicians individualize treatment plans to suit specific patients and modify them depending on the clinical response. oral steroids (prednisone [medrol]) can help severe cases of hives in the short term but their usefulness is limited by the fact that many cases of hives last too long for steroid use to be continued safely. other treatments have been used for urticaria as well including montelukast (singulair) ultraviolet radiation antifungal antibiotics agents that suppress the immune system and tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline [elavil endep] nortriptyline [pamelor aventyl] doxepin [sinequan adapin]). evidence to support the benefit of such treatments is sparse. in ordinary cases they are rarely needed. topical therapies for hives are available but are generally ineffective. they include creams and lotions which help numb nerve endings and reduce itching. some ingredients which can accomplish this are camphor menthol diphenhydramine and pramoxine. many of these topical preparations require no prescription. cortisone-containing creams (steroids) even strong ones requiring a prescription are not very helpful in controlling the itch of hives.,['hives'],wmd
what causes hernia?,ultimately all hernias are caused by a combination of pressure and an opening or weakness of muscle or fascia: the pressure pushes an organ or tissue through the opening or weak spot. sometimes the muscle weakness is present at birth; more often it occurs later in life. poor nutrition smoking and overexertion all can weaken muscles and make hernias more likely. anything that causes an increase in pressure in the abdomen can then cause a hernia including obesity lifting heavy objects diarrhea or constipation or persistent coughing or sneezing.,['hernia'],wmd
can a person get tonsilitis if they nolonger have tonsils. my son had tonsilitis. tonsilitis is a viral infection and does not require an antibiotic. however tonsilitis can be caused by strep which is bacterial which requires an antibiotic. dr did't do a strep test but perscribed an antibiotic. a few days after he got better i developed an extremely sore throat runny nose caughing headache no fever. tonsilitis symptoms. can i get tonsilitis if i had my tonsils removed? if i have a strep infection will my immune system fight it off.,i will never understand that rationale of giving antibiotics to anyone that has a viral infection. this is not good medicine. most cases of tonillitis are viral and antibiotics are absolutely worthless and sometimes even harmful. with that said. first i assume you are a healthy adult. most adults have relatively good immune systems that fight off viral (and bacterial) exposures 24/7. while the organisms may be capable of causing disease the organism has to find a susceptible host. most of the time we just fight off those alien bugs. if you don't have tonsils you can't get tonsillitis but you can get a viral infection but it does not mean it will be identical to your son who has a different immune system. you may just get a stuffy nose or nothing at all. in your case you did get an upper respiratory infection but it didn't have to come from your son. it could have been someone else and an entired different bug. there are over 200 respiratory viruses capable of causing colds. i get exposed to strep a dozen times a week and have never got it thanks to my own immune system (and perhaps better handwashing and other precautions). trust your immune system. in most cases you will be just fine. the cold that you most likely have now will likely improve in a few days on its own.,"['immune system', 'tonsil', 'fever', 'cough', 'antibiotic']",wmd

what surgery options do i have for hyperthyroidism?,surgery for hyperthyroidism (thyroidectomy) removes part or all of the thyroid gland. doctors rarely use this surgery to treat hyperthyroidism. you may need surgery if: your thyroid gland is so big that it is hard for you to swallow or breathe. you have thyroid cancer or your doctor suspects you have thyroid cancer. for more information see the topic thyroid cancer. you had serious side effects from taking antithyroid medicines. and radioactive iodine is not an option for you. you have a large goiter that radioactive iodine treatment did not shrink. you have a single large thyroid nodule that is making too much thyroid hormone and radioactive iodine did not effectively treat the nodule. surgery choices the only surgery for hyperthyroidism is thyroidectomy. what to think about if you are having surgery your doctor will have you take antithyroid medicines before surgery to bring your thyroid hormone levels as close to normal as possible. after surgery your doctor will check your thyroid hormone levels regularly because you may develop hypothyroidism (too little thyroid hormone). hypothyroidism is treated with thyroid hormone medicine. for more information see the topic hypothyroidism. surgery is the fastest way to treat your hyperthyroidism. but it is not used very often and is more risky and expensive than other treatments. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

why has salmon grown so much in popularity?,salmon is on many a restaurant menu these days at least in california. from salmon sandwiches or burgers to various renditions of grilled salmon â€” you are more likely to find salmon on the menu at casual cafes or elegant restaurants than ever before. at many of the restaurants i visited recently in southern california there was at least one additional salmon option added to the menu â€” like the salmon fillet sandwich from the la food show restaurant in manhattan beach. this sandwich was simple yet delicious featuring grilled salmon with cilantro aioli and fresh tomato and lettuce on a brioche bun. there were several other salmon entrees offered at this restaurant as well. i also noticed salmon as one of the protein options for some of the entrÃ©e salads at various restaurants. thats when i realized salmon had arrived as an official food trend. i love the food trends that are actually good for you! most of us now know that when we eat fish particularly fish higher in fat we are getting the health-promoting fish omega-3s which may help decrease blood clotting decrease abnormal heart rhythms reduce triglycerides and promote normal blood pressure. omega-3s appear to have anti-inflammatory action within body tissues and some researchers suggest getting more omega-3s to reduce the risk of inflammatory diseases. a 4-ounce serving of steamed or broiled salmon contains approximately:  233 calories.  25 grams protein.  13 grams fat.  2. 8 grams saturated fat.  5 grams monounsaturated fat.  5 grams polyunsaturated fat.  2. 5 grams omega-3 fatty acids.,['salmon'],wmd

had my period oct 1st-11th woke up today with bleeding. i am trying to get pregnant. why would i be bleeding again? . the iud was removed the 29th of september,"ask your gynecologist what could be causing your cycle to go awry. maybe it is related to having your iud taken out. or it could be hormonal. as you are trying to become pregnant are you taking any hormones? either way keep a ""menstrual journal"": a written record of how many days you bleed and how heavily it flows (and how much pain or other related symptoms you feel) on each of the days. show this record to your gyno after about 2 months. in the meantime be sure your gynecologist he or she is aware that you are having this bleeding problem. if there is pain either while you are bleeding or in that region any other time including during intercourse be sure to tell her/him that too. write it down as well on the menstrual journal. the idea is to determine a pattern. if your system becomes more stable and your periods become more regularly spaced and less heavy and severe as time passes that will be good because it should indicate that your hormones simply needed to adjust and are becoming normalized. but if this does not happen; if you keep right on having either very long periods or very heavy periods or more than one period a month or any combination of those things you will need to have your gyno do a complete examination and look over your menstrual journal; this will be crucially important because you will need to rule out any serious health issues that might have either started showing up because they had been hidden by the iud or have just developed right now. you may have endometriosis which is a condition that can be disguised by iuds or by taking birth control medications. you'll need to rule out anything like uterine or ovarian cancer which are unlikely but can sometimes happen. and you need to be sure you do not have hpv or other health conditions which can be catching. and you need to be certain the iud did not accidentally cause inflammation or injury either while it was in or while it was being removed. hope you are well soon; and good luck in becoming pregnant! if all goes well before long you will have a healthy baby! first get yourself in good health. it is do-able. be certain to tell not only your gynecologist but your primary care physician as well. and be sure both doctors know all medications and over-the-counter remedies including herbal ones you may be taking. these will have an influence on things as well. better health to you!","['period', 'pregnancy']",wmd

is there a downside to oral erection drugs?,well the downside to these products is that there are side effects. for example men that have certain high blood pressure disorders are taking nitrate medications. if you mix these oral erection drugs with that you can drop your blood pressure and have a serious complication. this is why men who take viagra levitra and cialis if after having sex they have a heart attack they have to tell the paramedics and er doctors they have this product in their systems. because one of the first things the doctors will want to do is put nitrates into their blood to stabilize their heart and their blood pressure. the combination can be deadly. there can be some visual disorders. one of the big side effects is that the drug really isnt being used correctly for many men. theyre either not being given enough trials with it it sometimes takes several doses before its effective they try it once and they say its not going to work and theyll go try something else. the other thing is its become very recreational. a lot of guys who dont need it are taking it which raises some concerns. why? because its almost become the thing to do. you know you take the drug and youre guaranteed a good erection. well if you had good erections before it probably wont help but its just kind of a macho kind of a way of just kind of having fun. the other concern is that for most men that have true erectile dysfunction thats a symptom of something far more serious whether its diabetes hormone problems metabolic problems vascular disorders. thats an early warning sign. and by simply throwing viagra levitra cialis at them and not addressing the cause im really doing them a lot of disservice. if its truly the first warning sign of potential coronary artery disease i mean if its the first warning sign of coronary artery disease and you dont do the right workup the guy may get great erections but he may have a heart attack in a year or two that could have been prevented. its essential that you understand why it is you have erectile dysfunction. some men just get it and thats the way that you are. but you want to make sure that theres nothing serious that youre missing.,"['erection', 'drug']",wmd

what are good strength-training exercises for the glutes?,(please clear any kind of exercise program with your physician and fitness professional especially if you have any physical disability or restrictions. ) 1. squats: squats are your mainstay for building and strengthening your buns. stand with feet hip-width apart and hold weights at shoulder level or at your sides. bend the knees and lower into a squat keeping the knees behind the toes. imagine that youre sticking your butt out behind you but keep the torso upright and contracted. press into the heels to stand up. repeat for 2-3 sets of 8-16 reps. 2. wall sit: stand about 2 feet in front of a wall and lean against it. slide down until your knees are at about 90-degree angles and hold keeping the abs contracted for 20-60 seconds. come back to start and repeat holding the squat at different angles to work the lower body in different ways. to add intensity hold weights or squeeze a ball between the knees. 3. leg press: here youll be pushing a weight or resistance away from yourself using your legs. this can be done with gym equipment or bands. 4. lunges: these exercises come in a variety of forms. the traditional lunge goes forward with weights and a bent knee or there is the assisted lunge with no weight and you can hold onto a wall or chair. or you can try a lunge that requires a much smaller range of motion lowering your body only part way. 5. dead lift: this exercise is not meant for everyone. it targets the lower back glutes and hamstrings. if you have any problems with these muscles dont do a dead lift. this exercise simulates what we do all day long as we bend over and pick things up. 6. hip extension: this is one of my favorite exercises to strengthen the glutes. stand facing a wall placing both palms on the wall and with a straight back simply push one leg out behind you as high as you can go keeping the back and leg straight. do this 10 times switching legs each time. or you can get on the floor on all fours and take one leg and simply stretch it straight behind you. do this 10 times switching legs each time. if you use ankle weights you can add more intensity for a real glute challenge.,['exercise'],wmd

if i am feeling really hungry after exercising what is the best thing to eat after a workout? . and i am a guy not sure if that matters.,this depends on a few things. if you exercise first thing in the morning or late in the afternoon you could quickly follow up with a healthy breakfast or dinner. if your workout is during non-meal time it's best to have something to replenish your muscle carbohydrate stores (called glycogen) with a little bit of protein for muscle repair and synthesis. research shows that eating foods with a combination of carbohydrates and protein is best (4:1 ratio) for recovery. here are some examples: whole wheat toast with peanut butter fruit with nuts and seeds (trail mix) apple with nut butter fruit smoothie with added protein yogurt topped with nuts chocolate milk (research has shown this to be a great recovery drink) granola/protein bar with the right combination of carb and protein for more on what to eat before during and after exercise see this webmd article. i have a protein shake which relieves me of that felling of being hungry. protein! most protein shakes are specifically formulated for post workout fuel and also contain other useful ingredients for your muscles and recovery. if you want food cottage cheese tuna oatmeal peanut butter are good examples. you do need to eat before two hours. it is good unless it's liquid item then 1hr is sufficient. as for the hunger after exercising out you will always get hunger after even if you ate before. you burn a lot of calories when you workout and your body wants more. it's fine to eat after you workout. that's one of the few times that carbs are okay. after i workout i drink a carb drink that's 400 calories and 100 carbs. and then i drink my protein shake after that.,"['hunger', 'exercise', 'workout']",wmd

what steps must be taken to become fertile if you have more male hormones than female hormones?,usually your doctor would put you on a regimen of androgen blockers and hormone supplements. androgen blockers don't have to be extreme in fact there is a common blood pressure pill that works for that. but that's what they'd probably do. they might choose to supplement your estrogen progesterone and possibly other things. and they'd monitor your blood to make sure you were becoming fertile and had the right levels. they would probably also monitor you throughout pregnancy to make sure you carried the child to term. so the therapy wouldn't be hard to do but you'd need a good doctor's help - either an endocrinologist or an ob/gyn. also a lot would depend on why your hormone balance is off in the first place. if it's due to polycystic ovarian syndrome that would require treatment too.,"['fertility', 'hormone']",wmd

what are some ways to save money on prescriptions?,i would say talk to your pharmacist and also let your doctor or healthcare provider know if you are having a problem paying for your medicines. there are a variety of different things and options that aren't available. there are prescription assistance programs that are offered to pharmaceutical manufacturers. the doctor maybe able to provide you some free samples. there are also some coupon programs where you maybe able to get a 7 or 14-day trial of the pharmacy to try. generic opportunities if the product is available generically that could be another option. i think a lot of people don't realize too by talking to their doctor and letting them know upfront that they're struggling with paying their medications maybe that means when they start a new medication they don't write for hundred pills right away. they have you write out for 30 pills and maybe you try it first to see how you're doing. so many times i have patients who come into the pharmacy and they say well this didn't work and i spent $200. and i'm like yeah he should have just written four months to try not three months right off the bat. everyone thinks well if i buy more it's cheaper in the long run. that's great when you are on something consistent for a long period of time but if it's something new maybe that's something to actually save cost in the long run because if it doesn't work then you did waste the money on that particular product and got switched to something else. always talk to your pharmacist with the medication experts we're here to help you i love talking to patients it's the best part of my day.,[],wmd

is there a cure for congestive heart failure?,as far as i know there is no cure for chf (although some people swear that they have been cured). but there are many treatment options to control the disease progression. there are diuretics to control fluid overload and medications to regulate the heart and improve breathing quality. long term survival with a diagnosis of chf is encouraging today. only a decade ago about 20% - 30% of folks with this condition survived five years after it being first detected. as of the year 2013 60% to 70% of people with it survive at least five years. given that many people are not diagnosed with chf until reaching their 8th decade of life it is not unusual for many of them to die within 5 years of being diagnosed. i know a woman who was diagnosed with chf asthma and copd at the age of 45 years old. she is now 63 years and promises to see her youngest grandchildren finish college (the two youngest grandchildren are presently only 2 years old). thats the type of attitude that is needed to keep your chf from destroying the joy of your life. the younger that you are when first diagnosed and the more vigilant you are about maintaining treatment directives (taking medications exactly as prescribed maintaining an ideal weight watch your fluid intake (limit it to about 48 ounces daily with your doctor's approval sounds right to me) keep your blood pressure within a good range consume a diet that is low in sodium sleep well exercise as permitted by your doctor and maintain a positive outlook there is no reason to look at chf as a death sentence. in summary: talk with your family doctor and cardiologist about your present symptoms. take a notebook with on your visit and ask the doctor's their advice on what you need to do in order to beat this disease. in that same notebook for the next 2 weeks annotate all of your daily activities medications taken and foods/liquids consumed. show your notebook to the doctors for their feedback. live a long and happy life by following the bolded recommendations above. i hope that this information has been helpful.,['congestive heart failure'],wmd

what causes tuberculosis?,because the bacteria that cause tuberculosis are transmitted through the air the disease can be contagious. but it's nearly impossible to catch tb by a single social contact with an infected person. to be at risk of being infected you must be exposed to tb bacteria constantly by living or working in close quarters with someone who has the active disease. even then because the bacteria generally stay latent (inactive) after they invade the body only 10% of people infected with tb will ever have the active disease. the remaining 90% have what's called latent tb infection  they show no signs of infection and won't be able to spread the disease to others. these latent infections can eventually become active though so even people without symptoms should receive medical treatment. medication can help get rid of the inactive bacteria before they become active.,['tuberculosis'],wmd

how long do i need to take protonix before i see any relief? do any of the ppis work any faster?,what we are finding out is that therapy needs to be individualized for these patients. patients may start off on one product like protonix. they need to take it though for usually two weeks to 30 days to see if there is any benefit to it. over time there are many different products that are available prescription and people are all different. we are finding out that if you take a pill and i take a pill it's going to work differently in both of us. for some patients it works really well and for others they might need to be switched. this can be a common occurrence in patients who were formerly taking nexium or prevacid. sometimes some of them do work a little quicker but it does depend on the person. so therapy needs to be individualized. as a pharmacist i recommend my patients to definitely keep a diary to keep track of their symptoms see if it is actually helping them. after a month i may ask them how are they feeling. if they tell me they are not feeling well i am probably going to advice them that they need to call their physician or healthcare provider to have it reassessed.,['vision'],wmd
what could be the cause of child's consistent stinky farts? . father has chrons disease. father's family has history of other gastro problems.,thank you for asking. you don't give the age of the child but it's worth noting that most people's flatulence (farting) has an odor. sometimes it's worse than others and the odor of a person's farts can vary from hour to hour or day by day. usually the smell of farts doesn't mean anything bad. many foods produce gas in the intestines. different foods can cause smelly farts in some people but not in others. eggs frequently cause stinky farts in many people as does broccoli. i wouldn't jump to the conclusion that a child's smelly gas indicates a medical problem. if the child has a good appetite and is eating a balanced diet with no other digestive problems (chronic diarrhea cramps bloating) then there's probably nothing wrong. just because one parent has a family history of digestive problems doesn't mean a child will inherit these. it's worth mentioning this history to the child's pediatrician who can help you monitor for diseases. wishing you well!,['family'],wmd

why are neighborhood medical spas buyer beware?,medical spas buyer beware because a medical spa implies that theres some medical treatments. often theres a staff physician or a nurse as opposed to just a traditional day spa. and so yes there are procedures that are offered. the question is whether thats the best environment for that. why would it not be? well it depends on how much on site supervision there is by a physician and what is the physicians specialty because by routine typically there is a dermatologist or a cosmetic surgeon available and sometimes on site but for some spas the so called medical director could be a pediatrician it could be a heart surgeon participating in a business enterprise. you just need to know that you have to have a license to be a medical director but the question is what specialty is that licensed doctor carry? how can a pediatrician or a heart surgeon actually do cosmetic procedures? that doesnt even make sense well they are really not doing the procedures in some of the spas and im not saying that this is the rule but there are some that we know about. they dont do them. they are really done by often very experienced and sophisticated nurse practitioners who specialize in that type of work. but there are some medical issues that can come up particularly suitability. should one have such and such a procedure? a given skin peel or the injections because not everyone is a candidate for these things. its not like shopping at a supermarket where you just take something off the shelf. there has to be some consideration for the right substance the right treatment and for the right skin and the right type of person in respect to their health. so thats where the system breaks down if in fact the supervising doctor hasnt been raised in the world of cosmetic surgery. and are most of them raised in the world of cosmetic surgery? dr. kotler: most most are raised in the cosmetic surgery world but not all and we do hear stories about physicians kind of migrating in to the medical spa because its uhm its a business its an investment opportunity or often the spa may be owned by business men and theyve appointed dr. x to be the quote medical director. but its good to have a sense of whos at the controls. whos responsible and who will be there if theres a problem. 15 all medical treatments have some potential for you know delayed healing some minor complications. who is going to be the backup? now lets say that there are doctors on hand. are those necessarily well trained doctors? that can vary. typically you see in a spa the doctor wouldnt be there all the time because he has to spend most of his time in the office or in the operating room. so again it depends but i think its a great question for someone considering a medical treatment and im not talking about a non medical treatment were not talking pedicures here but if someones considering having a botox injection or restylane or any type of skin peel any type of rejuvenative procedure done by a physician or a nurse you need to know what is that doctors background. is he or she really an expert or has the doctor kind of migrated into this field for whatever reason.,[],wmd

how lumbar injury affects cervical spine. my husband had a laminectomy after a disc ruptured & pieces entered the spinal column. a second laminectomy performed to remove remaining pieces. two years ago he required an xlif. he has problems with his cervical spine with some bulging discs. years ago his neurosurgeon told us eventually the damage could cause cervical and thorasic spine problems. a va dr. never heard of a connection between injury to the lumbar spine & problems with the cervical or thorasic spine. could you elaborate?,i'm sorry to hear your husband's going through this. although i'm clearly not an orthopedic surgeon i may be able to shed some light on this. while there's no direct link between a lumbar laminectomy and bulging discs in the cervical spine it is possible that the patient could succumb to poor posture and body mechanics in order to relieve pain in the lumbar spine. this could in turn lead to upper-back pain (likely muscular not skeletal). in terms of how the laminectomy could ultimately cause problems farther up the spinal column here's what can happen. if you fuse two vertebrae together they cannot flex and bend naturally anymore. this puts a lot of stress on the vertebra directly above (in the case of lumber; below in the case of cervical) the fusion. after many years the battered vertebra or spinal disc can degenerate or collapse leading to the need for another laminectomy or fusion. this will again put stress on the next vertebra/disc up and so on. people who have vertebral fusions at a younger age run the risk of needing additional surgeries as the years go by due to the problems i described above. i have no idea if any of this is going on with your husband. it's highly unlikely his cervical spine problems are related to his lumbar laminectomy. nonetheless back problems stink and i hope he's able to find treatments that give him relief!,[],wmd

i lost my brother to breast cancer. since having children i still get some milk out of the nipple. is this normal?,"it is important for women to know that breast cancer can be a man's disease as well. this also means that a genetic link can come from a male relative. fortunately the symptom you describe is not likely to be linked to breast cancer risk. it is not uncommon for women to be able to get small amounts of nipple discharge after having breastfed. the usual triggers for this to occurs are: nipple stimulation a a part of sexual foreplay hot showers birth control pills or ""checking for discharge"" by repeated squeezing. sometimes women will notice discharge from one or both nipples. this prompts concern especially if she has not recently breast fed. generally we tell women that bilateral white or clear discharge which is only present with nipple stimulation is likely to be ""normal. "" as mentioned above being on birth control pills can sometimes enhance breast discharge. certain psychiatric medicationsâ€”especially the antipsychotics â€”can initiate nipple discharge. bilateral spontaneous secretions can be prompted by a pituitary problem or hypothyroidism. both low thyroid and elevated prolactin (from the pituitary gland) can be checked for using simple blood tests. the most concerning nipple discharges are those which are red/bloody unilateral and coming from just one or two ducts. if you were my patient i would check a sample of the discharges for undiscernable blood (using the fecal blood card). i would do a careful breast exam and might send you for a mammogram or ultrasoundâ€”depending upon your age. i prefer to be safe rather than sorryeven when the discharge sounds non-pathologic. so get it checked out even though it is likely that you will be told it is ok.","['nipple', 'milk', 'breast cancer']",wmd

what are the signs and symptoms of the poison ivy rash?,the poison ivy rash usually starts one or two days after exposure though the delay between contact and its onset can be longer up to several days. this may lead to confusion over where the exposure took place. the first signs of the rash are curved lines of red itchy bumps or blisters. these continue to appear for many days depending on how much resin touched the skin at a given point. this makes it seem as though the rash is spreading although the fluid in blisters is just part of the allergic reaction and contains no chemicals or bacteria. it also makes it appear that there may still be poison ivy in clothes and/or on pets. although this is theoretically possible repeated washing of these often produces no improvement. poison ivy is not contagious neither from one person to someone else nor from one part of the body to another. many references emphasize that animals can carry the poison ivy resin. there's no doubt this is true but its practical significance may be limited. the first sign of poison ivy after all is usually a curved line of rash on the skin. unless your dog is shaped like a curved line your poison ivy is more likely to have come from a stem or leaf which dragged against the skin not from your pet.,"['skin', 'rash', 'poison ivy']",wmd

since insurance companies can't charge differential pricing wouldn't all fees go up for everyone now?,that's a great question and one many people are concerned with. first there are a few reasons why insurers can still charge higher rates. they can charge an older person up to 3x that of a younger person they can charge up to 50% more if you smoke and they can take into account where you live because medical care costs vary across the country. however the condition of your health cannot influence your costs. the main concern now is whether enough young healthy people will sign up for health insurance through the marketplaces. if they do the expectation is that the market will even out and prices won't spike. if however only older sicker people sign up costs could rise. we won't know for a while how it all turns out.,[],wmd

if i have already given my 6 year old benadryl and tylenol and she now has fever can i now give her motrin?,what are you treating? fevers in children are not dangerous. as a matter of fact fevers are therapeutic by helping to fight infection. the only reason to give a child ibuprofen or acetaminophen would be for comfort and it is certainly okay to do that. many people  mostly those fearful of fever  use both alternating acetaminophen and ibuprofen but studies have not proven that this is really necessary. is it safe? probably; they are two different drugs. i tell my patient to just pick one and use it sparingly. if they want me to choose i go for the ibuprofen. it lasts longer is anti-inflammatory and is safer. benadryl use in children is iffy too. it can dry up a runny nose for 2-4 hours but then it wears off and has to be repeated again. in adults benadryl can make you sleepy but in children it can actually stimulate them (this is called a paradoxical effect). benadryl is safe if your child is not having any adverse effects.,"['acetaminophen', 'fever']",wmd

what are the risk factors for having nerve pain after shingles?,researchers have long known that older people are more likely to get phn (postherpetic neuralgia) the nerve pain after shingles but recent studies have found other factors that increase risks. in one study published in the journal neurology researchers  including robert h. dworkin phd a professor in the department of anesthesiology at the university of rochester medical center in rochester n. y  looked at data from 965 people with shingles. the researchers identified five risk factors for developing phn in people who had been recently diagnosed with shingles: older female presence of symptoms before the rash appeared like numbness tingling itching or pain severe pain during the illness' initial stages severe rash. importantly the researchers found the more risk factors you have the greater the risk of developing phn. for instance 17% of women with shingles went on to get phn. 26% of people with severe pain did too. but 50% of women who were over 60 and had symptoms before the rash severe rash and acute pain went on to get phn.,"['shingles', 'nerve', 'pain']",wmd
what are the treatment options for children with depression?,if you have questions or concerns discuss them with your health care provider. treatment options for children with depression are similar to those for adults including psychotherapy (counseling) and medication. the role that family and the child's environment play in the treatment process is different from that of adults. your child's doctor may suggest psychotherapy first and consider antidepressant medicine as an additional option if there is no significant improvement. the best studies to date indicate that a combination of psychotherapy and medication is most effective. however studies do show that the antidepressant prozac is effective in treating depression in children and teens. the drug is officially recognized by the fda for treatment of children 8-18 with depression. treating children with bipolar disorder children with bipolar disorder are usually treated with psychotherapy and a combination of medicines usually an antidepressant and a mood stabilizer. use of an antidepressant alone can trigger bouts of manic and hyperactive behavior. the fda has determined that antidepressant medications increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in children and adolescents with depression and other psychiatric disorders. if you have questions or concerns discuss them with your health care provider.,['depression'],wmd

should a cook with an eye stye work,styes (hordeolum) are not contagious or infectious like conjunctivitis (pink eye). they are really just inflamed oil-glands. yes these things can be very nasty-looking but they do not pose any risk to customers. as long as the cook maintains a high-level of personal hygiene (hand washing not trying to touch/squeeze these painful lesions) he is capable of working. if the cook is in full-view of customers as he is preparing their meals it could result in a few double-takes from people who may not understand the nature of styes. i work closely with children and babies every day. if i had a big stye i would probably just stay home apply some hot compresses and wait for it to resolve. i pose no risk to the babies but i would get tired of explaining my eye to parents. in general a stye is not contagious so it's not a problem for a cook to continue to work. as always you would want to still practice good hand hygiene. here's a previous answer by dr. hoffman on this same issue: ,"['eyes', 'cooking']",wmd

how is celiac disease diagnosed?,celiac disease is suspected when individuals have signs or symptoms of malabsorption or malnutrition. other diseases however can produce malabsorption and malnutrition for example pancreatic insufficiency (a pancreas that is not able to produce digestive enzymes) crohn's disease of the small intestine and small intestinal overgrowth of bacteria. it is important therefore to confirm suspected celiac disease with appropriate testing. small intestinal biopsy small intestinal biopsy is considered the most accurate test for celiac disease. small intestinal biopsies can be obtained by performing an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (egd). during an egd the doctor inserts a long flexible viewing endoscope through the mouth and into the duodenum. a long flexible biopsy instrument is then passed through a small channel in the endoscope to obtain samples of the intestinal lining of the duodenum. multiple samples usually are obtained to increase the accuracy of the diagnosis. a pathologist then can examine the biopsies (under a microscope) for loss of villi and other characteristics of celiac disease such as increased numbers of lymphocytes. small intestinal biopsy does however have some limitations. for example acute viral gastroenteritis and allergy to cow's milk or soy protein can cause abnormal small intestinal biopsies that are indistinguishable from celiac disease. however acute viral gastroenteritis is not easily confused with celiac disease because of the difference in the acuteness of symptoms. (acute viral gastroenteritis has a sudden onset of symptoms and last only a few days. ) it is however easier to confuse cow's milk and soy protein allergies with celiac disease but these allergic conditions are rare and primarily occur in young children. despite these limitations small intestinal biopsies are recommended even for individuals who have abnormal antibody tests for celiac disease specific antibody tests for celiac disease antibodies are proteins that are produced by the immune system to fight viruses bacteria and other organisms that infect the body. sometimes however the body produces antibodies against non-infectious substances in the environment (for example in hay fever) and even against its own tissues (autoimmunity). blood tests that are specific for celiac disease include endomysial antibodies anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies and anti-gliadin antibodies. in patients with celiac disease anti-gliadin antibody is an antibody produced against gliadin in the diet and endomysial and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies are antibodies produced against the body's own tissues. endomysial antibodies and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies are highly reliable in diagnosing celiac disease. an individual with abnormally elevated endomysial and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies has a greater than 95% chance of having celiac disease. anti-gliadin antibodies are less reliable and have a high false positive rate. thus a person with an abnormally elevated anti-gliadin antibody level does not necessarily have celiac disease. nevertheless anti-gliadin antibody levels are useful in monitoring the response to treatment because anti-gliadin antibody levels usually begin to fall within several months of successful treatment of celiac disease with a gluten free diet.,['celiac disease'],wmd
does trichomoniasis cause problems during pregnancy?,yes. trichomoniasis can cause babies to be born early or at a low birth weight (less than 5 pounds). the cdc recommends that women with trichomoniasis who have symptoms should be treated but women without symptoms do not need to be treated. during the first three months of pregnancy many experts feel that women shouldn't take metronidazole (flagyl) because it may hurt the baby. however most doctors feel that metronidazole can be given safely after the end of the first trimester.,"['pregnancy', 'trichomoniasis']",wmd

what are the symptoms of cataracts?,cataract development is often equated to looking through a dirty windshield of a car or smearing grease over the lens of a camera. cataracts may cause a variety of complaints and visual changes including blurred vision difficulty with glare (often with bright sun or automobile headlights while driving at night) dull color vision increased nearsightedness accompanied by frequent changes in eyeglass prescription and occasionally double vision in one eye. a change in glasses may help initially once vision begins to change from a cataract; however as the cataract continues to grow vision becomes cloudy and stronger glasses or contact lenses will no longer improve sight. cataracts typically develop gradually and are usually not painful or associated with any eye redness or other symptoms unless they become extremely advanced. rapid and/or painful changes in vision raise suspicion for other eye diseases and should be evaluated by an eye-care professional.,['cataract'],wmd

what is the relationship of sludge to gallstones?,sludge is a common term for an abnormality of bile seen with ultrasonography of the gallbladder. specifically the bile within the gallbladder is seen to be of two different densities with the denser bile on the bottom. the bile is denser because it contains microscopic particles usually cholesterol or pigment embedded in mucus. (the mucus is secreted by the gallbladder). over time sludge may remain in the gallbladder it may disappear and not return or it may come and go. these particles may be precursors of gallstones and they occur often in some situations in which gallstones frequently appear for example rapid weight loss pregnancy and with prolonged fasting. nevertheless it appears that sludge goes on to become gallstones in only a minority of people. it is not clear how often  if at all  sludge alone causes problems. sludge has been blamed for many of the same symptoms as gallstones  biliary colic cholecystitis and pancreatitis but often these symptoms and complications are caused by very small gallstones that are missed by ultrasonography. it is also possible that these gallstone-like symptoms and complications are actually caused by small gallstones that have passed through the ducts and into the intestine rather than the sludge itself. thus there is uncertainty about the meaning of sludge. but it is clear that sludge is not the equivalent of gallstones. the practical implication of this uncertainty is that unless someone's symptoms are typical of gallstones sludge should not be considered the cause of the symptoms.,['gallstone'],wmd

what are some exercise tips for people with type 2 diabetes?,to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia if you have diabetes follow a regular routine of exercising eating your meals and taking your medicines at the same time each day. prolonged or strenuous exercise can cause your body to produce adrenaline and other hormones that can counteract the effects of insulin and cause your blood sugar to rise. if you are participating in strenuous exercise (exercising at your maximum capacity) or prolonged exercise (lasting for several hours or more) your insulin and/or oral diabetic medicine may need to be changed. talk to your health care provider about how to adjust your medicine. be careful exercising when your medicine is reaching its peak effect. depending on the time of exercise reducing your dose of either long-acting insulin or short-acting insulin will be necessary. your doctor can recommend how to make this adjustment. exercise with someone who knows you have diabetes and knows what to do if you have a low blood-sugar reaction. wear a medical identification tag (for example medicalert) or carry an identification card that states you have diabetes. the american diabetes association offers these basic exercise guidelines for those with diabetes: discuss with your doctor what types of exercise might be appropriate for you. complications of diabetes such as severe eye disease and nerve damage may make some forms of exercise dangerous for you. your doctor may also schedule a test to see how your heart responds to exercise. do not exercise if your blood sugar is greater than 250 mg/dl (milligrams per deciliter) and your ketones are positive. this is an indication that you already may have a lack of insulin and exercise will only cause a greater rise in your blood sugar. hydrate yourself and adjust your insulin as necessary contact your health care provider. use caution when exercising if your blood sugar is greater than 300 mg/dl without evidence of ketones. exercise may help decrease your sugars but it's possible they will increase instead. hydrate well prior to and after exercise and keep track of your sugars and ketones. learn the effects of various types of exercise on your blood sugar. have carbohydrate-based foods available for exercise and for the period following exercise. add carbohydrates to your meals if you plan on doing exercise adjust your insulin dose appropriately in anticipation of exercise.,"['type 2 diabetes', 'exercise']",wmd
do i burn calories while im sleeping?,sometimes you can burn more calories when you are asleep than when you are just lying in bed. and it all has to do with our stages of sleep specifically rem sleep. during rem sleep your brain is more active than any other stage. in fact in some cases it is more active than when you are awake. this activity requires fuel for thought called glucose â€“ the basic building block of most foods. in order to sleep better and lose weight: lose the snooze and set your alarm to tell you when to go to bed. use your alarm to help you know when to go bed to get the right amount of quality sleep. dont use the snooze button to potentially interrupt those final minutes of rem sleep! take a quick nap if you are feeling drowsy in the middle of the day. drink one glass of water for every alcoholic beverage you drink and stop all alcohol 3 hours before your bed time alarm goes off. alcohol can help you fall asleep but will keep you out of the deep stages of sleep and rem sleep that you need to avoid sleep deprivation stop exercise four hours before bed. work out earlier in the evening and consider yoga deep breathing or stretching before bed. have your breakfast outside in the morning and get plenty of sunlight to help re-set your internal biological clock. sleep loss affects weight loss â€” from your ability to burn calories to the food choices you make. start with a commitment to sleeping better and you may find yourself a few pounds lighter without changing anything else.,[],wmd
how do patients prepare for an ultrasound?,preparation for ultrasound is minimal. generally if internal organs such as the gallbladder are to be examined patients are requested to avoid eating and drinking with the exception of water for six to eight hours prior to the examination. this is because food causes gallbladder contraction minimizing the size which would be visible during the ultrasound. in preparation for examination of the baby and womb during pregnancy it is recommended that mothers drink at least four to six glasses of water approximately one to two hours prior to the examination for the purpose of filling the bladder. the extra fluid in the bladder moves air-filled bowel loops away from the womb so that the baby and womb are more visible during the ultrasound test.,['ultrasound'],wmd

how do the main osteoporosis medications differ?,the various medicines used to treat osteoporosis work in different ways. the various medicines used to treat osteoporosis work in different ways. bisphosphonates including drugs like actonel boniva fosamax and reclast work by blocking the effects of certain bone-destroying cells. in this way bisphosphonates can slow down bone loss and lower your risk of fracture. evista is a different sort of medicine called a selective estrogen receptor modulator or serm. it works by mimicking some of the effects of the hormone estrogen which has a beneficial effect on bone mass. other treatments are available. bone is constantly remodeling  old bone is removed by cells called osteoclasts and new bone is laid down by cells called osteoblasts. calcitonin a hormone made within the thyroid gland inhibits bone removal by osteoclasts and promotes bone formation by osteoblasts. forteo a synthetic hormone may also help build bone mass by enhancing the actions of osteoblasts. prolia stops the bone-removing cells before they cause bone loss and is used to treat postmenopausal woman with osteoporosis.,"['osteoporosis', 'drug']",wmd
how can i prevent a urinary tract infection (uti)?,there are lots of things you can do every day to help your body fight these infections or stop them from getting started. basic hygiene works. washing hands before and after going to the bathroom will help as will washing your genital area with mild soap each day. women should always wipe from front to back after voiding and especially after a bowel movement to avoid spreading bacteria from the rectum to the vagina and urethra. drinking enough fluids (6 eight-once glasses each day) and drinking some cranberry juice every day can prevent bacteria from multiplying and causing problems. empty your bladder soon after you feel the urge to go and go at least 4 or 5 times a day. you can make sure your bladder is empty by using your hand to press lightly on the area over your bladder. avoid wearing tight pants and non-cotton underwear. don't use perfumed soaps bubble bath talcum powder or colored toilet paper. know the symptoms of a urinary tract infection and call your doctor or nurse if you start to have any of these symptoms: increased urinary urgency or frequency urinating small amounts sudden unwanted urine leakage feeling that your bladder is not completely empty after voiding any pain or unusual sensation when you void bad-smelling urine fever or chills see blood in your urine or the color of your urine is pink or red.,['urinary tract infection'],wmd

can you get chlamydia just from switching from anal sex to vaginal sex? . i have a friend who had been previously tested for any stds and was negative then after she had sex with one guy (during sex she had anal sex and then went back to vaginal sex) she had chlamydia. her doctor said that the switching from anal to vaginal could possibly give her the chlamydia. is that true? i have also been told that you can contract all sorts of things from switching and just wanted to do my own research.,and i'm glad you asked. i think maybe your friend misunderstood what the doctor told her. chlamydia is a very common sexually transmitted infection (sti). you can get chlamydia through vaginal anal or possibly even oral sex. switching from anal sex to vaginal sex in one session may not make you more likely to get chlamydia. however anyone who does have anal sex without a condom before vaginal sex should make sure her partner has thoroughly cleaned his penis. otherwise you could transfer intestinal bacteria (or other types of stis) into the vagina which might not be good. obviously your best bet is always to practice safe sex by having your partner use a condom. it's not perfect because it won't necessarily protect you (or him) from stds like human papillomavirus (hpv) or herpes but it's better than no protection at all. hope this helps!,[],wmd

are there long-term harmful effects to taking anacin or paracetamol for chronic migraine-tension headaches?,paracetamol is also known as acetaminophen in the united states and is marketed as tylenol along with other product names. anacin is a combination of aspirin and caffeine. both are effective medications and both have potentially harmful side effects. paracetamol can through its breakdown products cause damage to the liver and kidney. generally doses should be kept below four grams per day although some physicians believe that when used chronically the dose should be kept below two grams per day. aspirin's most common side effect is gastric upset and ulceration. it also interferes with blood clotting which is why it is used to help prevent heart disease. with large toxic doses it can cause life-threatening problems with acidosis (excessive acid in the fluids and tissues of the body). a standard maximum daily dosage is six 325 mg pills per day. these drugs can also in large doses cause difficulty with hearing including tinnitus and deafness. you should let your family physician know what you are taking so that he or she can monitor you for side effects and possible drug interactions. in addition you need to be aware of what is in other over-the-counter medications that you take to make sure that they do not have either paracetamol or aspirin in them making your daily intake of these medications higher than you think.,"['migraine', 'tension headache', 'acetaminophen']",wmd

how do i calculate my target heart rate during aerobic exercise?,"heart rate reserve your heart beat rises during aerobic exercise. it can rise from 70 beats per minutes (bpm) at rest to as high as 170 bpm or even higher during exercise depending on the intensity of the exercise your fitness level your age and other factors. whether you train aerobically or anaerobically is determined by the intensity of your workout and monitoring the intensity is the key to know if you are working out aerobically. for many individuals simply monitoring how the body feels while exercising is enough to determine the proper aerobic intensity. warm and slightly out of breath"" is a good measure for aerobic activity; that is ask yourself if you feel warm and slightly out of breath while you're exercising and if the answer is ""yes "" then that's good enough. on the other hand some people like to know with more precision how their body is doing during exercise. if that's the case for you then taking your heart rate during exercise and using a target heart rate training zone might be just the ticket. target heart rate zones range anywhere from 50% to 100% of your maximum heart rate (your maximum heart rate is based on your age). aerobic exercise is anything less than 85% and anaerobic exercise is anything above that. a nice starting point for a sedentary individual is somewhere in the range from 50% to 65% (you can always increase as you get more fit) and 65% to 85% for more conditioned individuals. try the heart rate reserve method for calculating a target heart rate. here's the formula and an example of the method for someone 27 years old assuming a resting heart rate of 70 bpm and a training range of 70%. if you plug in other values you can get other ranges. 1. 220-age = max hr. 2. subtract resting heart rate from max hr = heart rate reserve (hrr). 3. multiply hrr times percent you want to train at. 4. add back resting heart rate. assuming a resting heart rate of 70 bpm 27 years old and 70% training range: 220 - 27 = 193 193 - 70 = 123 123 x. 70% = 86 86 + 70 = 156","['exercise', 'target heart rate']",wmd

is there a link between continually hives and sythetic thyroid medications? . i just started to get hives on my body one day. the dermatologists did the removal of possible triggers and nothing helped. it has been about 3 and 1/2 yrs and i have to take antihistamine medications to keep them at bay. i also have hypothyroidism (for 15 yrs. ) and i heard synthetic medications may cause thyroid antibodies to react against the body causing the hives. has anyone seen this connection?,any medication including thyroid medications can cause an allergic reaction such as hives. the incidence of hives with thyroid medication though is very low. however there is a known association between hives and thyroid antibodies. about a quarter of patients with long term hives (chronic urticaria) have antibodies to thyroid tissue and many of these patients are found to have low thyroid levels. the patients who had the worst hives were also the ones more likely to have antibodies to thyroid tissue. hives patients can also have antibodies to other immune mediated diseases such as lupus. unfortunately treating the thyroid condition does not eliminate the hives. hello i have hypothyrodism for about 14 yrs now. i am fine taking 150 synthroid. anyways the problem is my son. he is now 36yrs old and was diagnosed with graves about 2yrs ago. he was given the radio active iodine treatment to shut or slow it down. a year later now they started him on synthroid levo armour including others that have been made specially for him but they all cause him to break out in hives and swelling around the face after one or two days. he has seen two allergist since. the first one diluted each and everyone of the meds and injected them in liquid form and sure enough the hives started. he is now off all thyroid meds but very frustrated and feeling all the symthoms of hypo. none of the doctors know what to say or have an answer. and i am frustrated too because i want to help him as i am hypo and don't have any problems like that. please help. if anyone knows about this conditions i have come across many forums about this allergies to meds but again no real answers and they seem to be old 2003 04?,"['hives', 'hypothyroidism', 'thyroid']",wmd

i started eggs & wheat to my 9 months old infant 3 months ago he had no allergy should i withhold them until he is12? . i wonder if repeated exposures may develop allergy later on.,it is a little early for most american pediatrician recommendation for whole eggs but since you have already started it and he is doing fine there is really no reason to stop at this point. wheat if tolerated is just fine at age 9 months. at age 12 months he can have just about anything you eat. the rationale in laying different types of foods as children age is to limit the chance of a food intolerance or allergy. wheat and eggs tend to be common allergies. in other parts of the world children are feel traditional diets that defy some of the u. s. recommendations. children in china may be getting tiny amounts of fish (pre-chewed by the mother). in mexico children are often given bean juice (the water from cooked beans). goodness knows what kids in remote areas of africa are eating at this age. nature allows for many variations in diet so don't feel guilty that you jumped the nutritional gun a bit sooner than most. in 12 more weeks nothing really magic is going to happen but then your child can eat nearly all foods.,[],wmd

how long are you contagious to other people when you have sinusitis and tonsilitis?,sinusitis and tonsillitis are not technically contagious. exposing someone else will not necessarily give them you exact same disease. it is the germs (bacteria viruses) that can be contagious but exposure to those germs will not necessarily result in the same or any disease since everyone's immune system is different. viruses are the most common pathogens and most respiratory viruses that cause sinusitis or tonsillitis are thought to be transmittable by close contact for a day before you know you are ill and for 2-3 days later. mono is a virus that can cause tonsillitis and mono is contagious for a longer period of time. again exposure does not imply that someone would get anything else by a simple cold. strep can cause both tonsillitis and sinusitis and this bacteria is contagious as long as you are contagious or until the end of your antibiotic course. strep will not just jump out of your throat or nose onto someone else but sharing drinks kissing sneezing in someone's face can certain expose others. if their immune system is susceptible to strep they can certainly get it. sinusitis and tonsilitis are not contagious diseases. so you may not worry of affecting anybody in your close vicinity.,['sinus infection'],wmd
"when is a ""muffin top "" extra belly fat dangerous?","any woman can get a muffin top. but women are more likely to gain excess belly weight  especially deep inside the belly  as they go through perimenopause and into menopause when their menstrual cycle ends. that's because as estrogen levels drop body fat is redistributed from the hips thighs and buttocks (where it used to be stored as a fuel reserve for breastfeeding) to the abdomen. developing a pooch of subcutaneous (below the skin) fat  what i call the ""menopot""  is perfectly normal. but if you gain more than 2 to 5 pounds it's likely to go deeper into the abdomen creating too much visceral fat. you need some fat in your belly but when it becomes excessive i call it ""toxic fat.

my 9 month old baby is coughing really hard while sleeping,your baby either has a cold (viral infection) or is teething. or both. babies often have a difficult time dealing with drainage either saliva or mucous when they are lying flat so a cough is important to clear their airway. coughing can certainly be a sign of something more serious (bronchiolitis rsv pneumonia etc. ) because your baby is immunocompromised due to age so it would be best to have a medical provider listen to those little lungs. there is very little you can do at this age to control a cough but you can make it easier for them to swallow excess mucous by using a cool mist humidifier in the room and sucking out nasal mucous using a special bulb syringe. a drop of saline in each nostril just prior to aspirating it will help loosen any thick mucous.,"['cough', 'baby']",wmd
what are the risk factors for pelvic organ prolapse?,"the most consistently cited risk factors are: increasing age being overweight and increased number of vaginal deliveries. number of deliveries by c-section does not increase prolapse risk. other associated factors can include irritable bowel syndrome constipation and overall poor health. african-american women are less likely to have symptomatic pelvic prolapse. one small study even found that having a history of stretch marks doubled one's risk for prolapse. ""stretch marks "" you might be thinking ""why would that be? "" the bones of the female pelvis do a great job protecting lower abdominal contents but they do not provide support. the pelvic organs are supported by the muscles in the pelvic floor and the ligaments which can attach from the organs to the bones. it has been theorized that pelvic muscle and ligament strength may be linked to strength of collagen. collagen along with fibrillin is decreased in women with stretch marks.","['organ', 'pelvis']",wmd
can anti-depressants cause sexual dysfunction?,many antidepressants if not most of them can cause poor libido inability to have an orgasm erectile dysfunction in men etc. when antidepressants increase serotonin in the brain to help depression and anxiety they also increase serotonin in the spinal cord which may disrupt sexual functioning at the same time. this serotonin over-activity may cause sexual problems. unfortunately it is very clear that stopping an antidepressant too quickly will often result in the major depression symptoms coming right back. below are some ideas about how to avoid sexual side effects or treat them if they happen to you. 1) use psychotherapy to treat your depression or anxiety. psychotherapy has no sexual side effects and in many studies is shown to be as effective as medications in helping depression or anxiety. consider a bona fide course of psychotherapy such as cognitive behavioral psychotherapy interpersonal psychotherapy or psychodynamic psychotherapy as these specific types of psychotherapy have well documented outcomes in the treatment of depression and anxiety 2) ask your doctor to choose an antidepressant with less sexual side effect risk. bupropion (wellbutrin) antidepressant products do not manipulate serotonin at all and are considered to be sexual side effect free by many doctors. trazodone (desyrel oleptro) products manipulate serotonin mildly and through a different mechanism and appear to have less sexual side effect problems as well. in treating certain forms of anxiety buspirone (buspar) also is known for producing fewer sexual side effects. 3) if you have to be on a serotonergic antidepressant and develop sexual problems consider asking your doctor for an antidote. almost none of these medications are fda approved for improving sexual functioning however many psychiatrists use them in order to lower sexual side effects while keeping their patient on an effective serotonin antidepressant. patients will have to take two medications at the same time but often two medications may improve depression more substantially and also lower sexual side effects at the same time. erectile dysfunction medications (sildenafil â€” viagra â€” etc. ) may specifically help men and they can be used as well. 4) just bite the bullet. sometimes patients cannot avoid being on serotonin-based antidepressants. these antidotes may not be safe for the individual patient or may not work for the patient. in this case patients will have to decide to have continued good antidepressant effect but suffer sexual side effects or risk discontinuing the antidepressant and a possible relapse into major depression. often times depression is treated from six months to a year with good antidepressant treatment. giving up sexual functioning for a year might be worth keeping the depression away. can you suggest further what the medication antidotes are? i have very resistant depression and must be on ssri (and wellbutrin and trazodone and seroquel) and i wonder what would be a medication for women that would address these side effects? thanks.,"['antidepressant', 'sexual dysfunction']",wmd

should i give ipecac to induce vomiting?,times past it was recommended that families with children keep a bottle of ipecac on the shelf in case junior ingested something poisonous. ipecac will reliably cause vomiting about 20-30 minutes after its given so the idea was that you could at least get your child to vomit back the poison. we know now that advice to keep ipecac handy and use it after poisonous ingestions was wrong. though it does cause vomiting that 20-30 minute lag in effectiveness means that in many cases the poison has already been absorbed or has at least traveled beyond the stomach so it cant be brought back up. some ingested things cause as much damage on the way out as when they were eaten and vomiting them will only make things worse. most importantly drinking ipecac will prevent emergency physicians from being able to use truly effective treatments for ingestion such as activated charcoal or medical antidotes. there are current no situations where national poison control centers advice the use of ipecac and the american academy of pediatrics does not recommend parents keep ipecac in their house. if you think someone has ingested something poisonous your best next step is to call the nationwide poison control center at 1-800-222-1222 in the us. try to have the most important information available to discuss: what was ingested when was it ingested who took it and how much was ingested. theyll tell you what steps to take whether you need to go to the er or what to monitor at home.,['vomit'],wmd

can aburterol help my cough. my wife has been coughing for three days now and her throat is itching and it keeoing her up at night what can i give her to make her feel better.,albuterol is a bronchodilator used typically for asthma and a reactive airway. if the cause of your wife's cough is due to asthma or an allergic disorder then yes it may help. albuterol is not a cough suppressant however. knowing the cause of the cough is always important when determining how to treat it. a cough due to a cold (very common) is from post-nasal drainage so the cough is beneficial since it helps clear the airway. a cough due to allergies can be very irritation so an antihistamine may help. suppressing a cough is considered controversial but often helpful if the cough interferes with sleep. a teaspoon or two of honey can help or if you are looking for an over-the-counter suppressant one containing dextromethorophan (dm) is often helpful. a cough can also be a sign of a lung infection so if any cough persists especially one that is accompanied by chest pain fever or productive of thick mucous should be carefully evaluated by a medical provider. have her drink lots of water and humidify the air she breathes (a cool mist humidifier). all of these things will help quiet a cough.,"['throat', 'cough']",wmd

what is colorectal cancer?,"inside your abdominal cavity is the long tubular digestive tract. the second part of this tube  the large intestine  is composed of the colon which stretches four to six feet and the rectum which is only four to six inches long. the inner lining of this ""colorectal tube"" can be a fertile breeding ground for small tumors called polyps (figure 1). about a quarter of all adults in the u. s. over the age of 50 will have at least one colorectal polyp. most colorectal cancers develop from polyps in glandular tissue of the intestinal lining. most polyps are benign but at least one type is known to be precancerous. these are called adenomatous polyps. the size of the polyp correlates with the development of cancer. polyps less than 1 cm in size have a slightly greater than a 1% chance of becoming cancer but those 2 cm or greater have a 40% chance of transforming into cancer. overall the incidence is about 5%. most colorectal cancers develop from polyps in glandular tissue of the intestinal lining. if colorectal cancer is diagnosed and treated early while the tumor is still localized the disease is highly curable with five-year survival rates of about 90%. if the tumor continues to grow cancer can spread directly through the bowel wall to surrounding lymph nodes tissues and organs as well as into the bloodstream. once the cancer spreads to lymph nodes or other organs successful treatment becomes more difficult. depending on how advanced the disease is five-year survival rates range from 9% to 93%. cancers of the colon and rectum are the third most common cancer in the u. s. with approximately 150 000 cases diagnosed each year. like many cancers colorectal cancer is of particular concern for people older than age 50. although diagnosis is often possible at an early stage many people delay seeking medical care because they are embarrassed or fearful of symptoms related to their bowels. risk increases significantly after age 50 and continues to increase with age.",['colon cancer'],wmd

hi i just turned 12 and my penis is 4. 6 inches long is this normal and why does it grow so quick,"it's probably time to say ""welcome to puberty! "" it sounds like everything is normal to me. when you enter puberty a cascade of hormones begins flooding through your body. these hormones cause you to develop body hair and they also will cause your penis to become larger. the testicles also increase in size. and yes sometimes these things happen with startling quickness. that seems to be the case with you. please don't get into a habit of measuring your penis. every guy on the planet gets worried about his penis size: is it too small? let me tell you there is a wide range of ""normal"" penis sizes. yours sounds within the normal range and it's probably not done developing yet. another thing: eventually years from now you'll be ready to use that penis to have sex. please remember to always practice safe sex. use a condom even if the girl you're with tells you she's on birth control. condoms protect you (and your partner) from a wide variety of sexually transmitted diseases. at 12 years old you're nowhere near ready for sex. but a little information now may help you later right? if you can't talk to your parents about puberty sex and all the physical and emotional changes you're going through try to find a trusted adult (maybe a friend's dad athletic coach pastor or school counselor) to confide in. it's good to talk to someone who can tell you ""everything's going to be ok.

what is inr?,inr stands for international normalized ratio. the inr provides some information about a persons bloods tendency to clot (which is often described as how thin or thick their blood is). the inr comes from the conversion of another value the prothrombin time (pt). prothrombin time is the time it takes for blood to clot in a test tube. a high or low pt can suggest bleeding or clotting tendencies. most often the pt is checked to monitor a persons response to blood thinners such as warfarin (coumadin). the problem with prothrombin time testing is that several manufacturers produce and sell slightly different pt tests to laboratories. the same persons blood might have different results if tested on two different companies pt tests. to solve this problem the international normalized ratio (inr) was created. by entering a pt result into a math formula it yields the inr. the international normalized ratio means one labs test results can be compared to anothers with high accuracy. a normal inr is approximately 1. 0. people taking the blood thinner warfarin typically have a target inr of 2. 0 to 3. 0. people with an inr higher than the normal range who arent taking warfarin may have a medical condition that needs further evaluation. a low inr is rarely significant.,[],wmd

what could cause my urine to be cloudy or have a strong odor?,if your urine is cloudy and then clears up later in the day and you have no other symptoms you probably have nothing to worry about. eating a large meal or drinking lots of milk can cause urine to be cloudy temporarily. women may also have a small amount of vaginal discharge mixing with urine that makes it look a little cloudyâ€”this is also usually not a problem so do not worry. if cloudiness persists and you have other symptomsâ€”pain and burning during urination a feeling of urgency or even fever for exampleâ€”you need to talk to your primary care provider about it as you may have a urinary tract infection or other condition requiring treatment. if your urine is dark amber in color and has a strong odor too it may indicate that it's extremely concentrated. this can happen after heavy exercise and sweating and means that you need to drink more water to avoid dehydration. if the extra water intake doesn't lighten the color and odor of your urine you may have other conditions that require medical attention such as a urinary tract infection or even early diabetes. sometimes foods cause urine to have an odor (asparagus for example) but the odor should go away after a few hours or overnight. if a strong odor persists it's time to contact your health care provider and have a urine test to determine the cause.,['urination'],wmd

who gets parkinson's disease?,"nearly 50 000 americans are diagnosed with parkinson's disease each year but getting an accurate count of the number of cases may be impossible because many people in the early stages of the disease assume their symptoms are the result of normal aging and do not seek help from a physician. also diagnosis is sometimes difficult and uncertain because other conditions may produce symptoms of parkinson's disease and there is no definitive test for the disease. people with parkinson's disease may sometimes be told by their doctors that they have other disorders and people with parkinson's disease-like diseases may be incorrectly diagnosed as having parkinson's disease. parkinson's disease strikes about 50% more men than women but the reasons for this discrepancy are unclear. while it occurs in people throughout the world a number of studies have found a higher incidence in developed countries possibly because of increased exposure to pesticides or other toxins in those countries. other studies have found an increased risk in people who live in rural areas and in those who work in certain professions although the studies to date are not conclusive and the reasons for the apparent risks are not clear. one clear risk factor for parkinson's disease is age. the average age of onset is 60 years and the incidence rises significantly with increasing age. however about 5% to 10% of people with parkinson's disease have ""early onset"" disease that begins before the age of 50. early onset forms of the disease are often inherited though not always and some have been linked to specific gene mutations. people with one or more close relatives who have parkinson's disease have an increased risk of developing the disease themselves but the total risk is still just 2%-5% unless the family has a known gene mutation for the disease. an estimated 15%-25% of people with parkinson's disease have a known relative with the disease. in very rare cases parkinsonian symptoms may appear in people before the age of 20. this condition is called juvenile parkinsonism. it is most commonly seen in japan but has been found in other countries as well. it usually begins with dystonia and bradykinesia and the symptoms often improve with levodopa medication. juvenile parkinsonism often runs in families and is sometimes linked to a mutated parkin gene.","[""parkinson's disease""]",wmd

can shrimp and french fries cooked in the same greese cause allergic reaction. hi at the age of 40 i developed an allergie to peanuts and shellfish at the same time. i had the test run they came back negative. so i went to red lobster and two hours later was rushed to the hospital with a shellfish allergie. two weeks later bought a snickers out of a vending machine back to the er.,yes different foods cooked in the same oil could result in cross-contamination as traces of the allergenic proteins may be left behind in the oil. cross-contamination can also occur on cutting boards grills and cooking vessels and utensils that are re-used without cleaning. when eating out at restaurants its important that you be vocal and communicate your allergies with your waiter/waitress so that the cook/chef can make the appropriate accommodations when preparing your food. even if you dont think that the food that youre ordering contains any of your allergens its better to have them check before you consume it to avoid further incidents. it will be important to mention that you have an allergy regardless so that you can be assured that proper food handling techniques are used and that there will be no cross-contamination. i would also suggest keeping a food journal so that you can better identify your triggers and gain a better understanding of your reaction to certain foods. in the case of severe anaphylaxis your doctor may equip you with an epipen so that youre able to stop allergic reactions fast any contact with a food you are allergic to can cause an allergic reaction. best advice: if you're allergic to shellfish never eat somewhere that serves it. lobster is a shellfish and peanuts are in snickers. stay far away from things you're allergic to and talk to your doctor about an epi-pen.,"['lobster', 'peanut', 'shellfish', 'shrimp', 'running']",wmd

(smile) i don't have a lot to offer but i can tell you that regular old cornstarch (available at the grocery store near the flour) can help dry out the rash and it's safe even for baby girls (with all those delicate skin folds). in fact since it doesn't contain perfume it's a good choice for diaper rash in little girls. if it's possible to dry out your baby's bottom by leaving the diaper off altogether for periods of time that's helpful too. whatever you do please do not use any over-the-counter (otc) yeast infection medications on your baby. she may be uncomfortable but she'll survive until you get a diagnosis from a health care professional. i hope this helps a little bit!","['diaper rash', 'yeast infection', 'baby']",wmd

what happens to someone when they get parkinsons disease?,"the symptoms and the course of parkinson's disease can vary a great deal from person to person. there is no known cure for parkinson's disease. however drugs surgery exercise and lifestyle changes can relieve some symptoms of the disease. emotions may also affect symptoms. anxiety tension and unhappiness may make symptoms worse. relaxing usually reduces symptoms. sometimes during stress a person with parkinson's disease has a ""paradoxical outburst. "" this results in a short symptom-free period when the person may be able to move normally. treatment may help control symptoms during the early stages of parkinson's disease and is usually started as soon as symptoms begin to affect a person's ability to work or do daily activities. for instance a right-handed person with tremor only on the left side may not feel limited by the symptoms and may not feel the need to take drugs until symptoms get worse. a person who cannot do his or her job because of symptoms may want to begin treatment sooner than someone who does not work or whose symptoms do not affect his or her ability to work. symptoms of parkinson's disease typically begin appearing between the ages 50 and 60. they develop slowly and often go unnoticed by family friends and even the person who has them. a small number of people have symptoms on only one side of the body that never progress to the other side. drugs can control symptoms to some extent but as the disease progresses drugs may become less effective. parkinson's disease also can cause a variety of complications as it advances. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

what steps can i take to a heart-healthy diet?,"""the stomach carries the heart and not the heart the stomach. ""  miguel de cervantes i think that cervantes had it about half right. it's true that what we eat directly impacts our heart health. but we also rely on a healthy heart to enjoy life's pleasures which should definitely include eating good foods. how we shop and prepare our food makes a huge impact on our health. so what can you do to make sure you're on the right track? here are three tips to get you started. 1. clean out your pantry. do it today and try it at least once a month. go through your fridge and even that old freezer in the garage too. take stock of what you've got and what you don't need. focus on purging processed foods foods with trans fats and food products that contain high fructose corn syrup. while throwing away food of any type is less than ideal it's important to recognize that most of these products aren't real food anyway. get rid of them and start fresh next time you go shopping. 2. read food labels. think of reading food labels as having a free dietitian at your disposal. first determine what the actual serving size of your food item is supposed to be. you might be amazed to learn that you have been drinking two servings of your favorite soda in one bottle or that the bowl of cereal you usually pour for yourself was meant for three. second look at the trans fats listing. it should read zero. next look for fancy lingo on your label. a good example is ""partially hydrogenated "" which is a term that companies use sometimes to sneak small amounts of trans fats into their products. finally look for foods low in sodium. it turns out that processed foods provide about 80% of the sodium in our diets. you can make a great improvement in your diet by choosing low-sodium or sodium-free options. 3. outsmart the supermarket. when grocery shopping have you ever wondered why you could never find a decent tomato? but it's so easy to find candy bars frozen pizzas and even tabloid magazines. it's called ""market research. "" supermarkets understand all too well how their customers walk through stores and how this can impact their buying habits. we tend to start our shopping on the right side of the store swing around the back and then head toward the checkout line through the middle. this is why so many cheap (""cheap"" from the supermarket's perspective) convenience foods are in the center aisle and the candy is prominently displayed as you swipe your credit card. it can be harder to find some of the healthier foods that have a lower profit margin. the solution is to attentively shop from a list and to avoid any impulse purchases. people don't tend to buy quinoa and steel-cut oats when they're in a hurry. eat fruits and vegatables and you should try to get good nutriants","['heart', 'diet']",wmd

can cigarette residue on fingers or mouth cause vaginal bacterial or yeast infection through oral or digital sex?,hi done some very quick research on an idea just google these. does nicotine cause bv does nicotine cause yeast infections now under this last one found you this but most of the info is from smoking.  tobacco use when caused by the use of tobacco yeast infections can occur in anyone. the reason that tobacco use increases the risk of oral thrush is that it alters the chemistry of your mouth allowing the candida bacteria to move into a position of power. your mouth is already a prime area as far as candida is concerned because in is generally both warm and moist. the skin in some parts of your mouth is also very thin allowing candida better access to the supplies of nutrients hidden just below the surface. generally your helper bacteria and immune system can stave off candida infection but if you do something like chew tobacco smoke or just generally practice poor dental hygiene you could be helping to swing the balance in the direction of the bacteria. if you have dentures you are at a particularly high risk of developing oral thrush particularly if the dentures dont fit well and if you also use tobacco yeast infections are very likely to develop. perhaps this will help better. good luck,"['finger', 'mouth', 'vagina', 'bacterium', 'yeast infection']",wmd

what are bacterial and viral infections?,bacterial and viral infections have many similarities. both types of infections are caused by microbes  bacteria and viruses respectively  and spread by routes such as: coughing and sneezing. contact with contaminated people especially through activities such as kissing and sexual intercourse. contact with contaminated surfaces food and water. contact with contaminated creatures including household pets livestock and insects such as fleas and ticks. microbes can also cause: acute infections which are short-lived. chronic infections which can last for weeks months or a lifetime. latent infections which may not initially cause symptoms but which can reactivate over a period of months and years. most importantly bacterial and viral infections  which are defined as an invasion of microbes able to reproduce in the body  can cause mild moderate and severe disease. throughout history millions of people have succumbed to diseases such as bubonic plague or the black death which is caused by the yersinia pestis bacterium and smallpox which is caused by the variola virus. in recent times viral infections have been responsible for two major pandemics: the 1918-1919 spanish flu epidemic that killed 20-40 million people and the ongoing hiv/aids epidemic that killed an estimated 2 million people worldwide in 2008 alone. bacterial and viral infections can cause similar symptoms such as coughing and sneezing fever inflammation vomiting diarrhea fatigue and cramping  all of which are ways the immune system tries to rid the body of infectious organisms. but bacterial and viral infections are dissimilar in many other important respects most of them due to the organisms' structural differences and the way they respond to currently available antimicrobial medications.,"['bacterium', 'virus', 'infection']",wmd

how common is travelers' diarrhea?,twenty percent to 50% of travelers may develop diarrhea depending on the region of the world they visit. diarrhea is the most common illness of travelers. in general travelers at risk for diarrhea commonly come from industrialized nations and travel to high-risk areas that are primarily within developing or less industrialized nations of the world including latin america africa the middle east and asia. areas of lesser risk include china and some caribbean nations. travel to areas of the u. s. canada northern europe and australia pose the lowest risk to travelers. men and women are at equal risk for developing travelers' diarrhea. younger individuals are more commonly afflicted perhaps because of more adventurous eating habits. people with disorders that compromise their immune system (such as hiv cancer chemotherapy steroid use) diabetes patients and people with underlying abdominal disorders (irritable bowel syndrome colitis) are more susceptible to travelers' diarrhea. interestingly people on acid blockers for their stomachs  such as famotidine (pepcid) cimetidine (tagamet) omeprazole (prilosec) and esomeprazole (nexium)  also have a higher susceptibility to travelers' diarrhea because they have less stomach acid to protect them from the bacteria that cause the condition.,"['diarrhea', ""traveler's diarrhea""]",wmd

how should i take omeprazole and levothyroxine which are to be taken in the morning four hours apart?,currently there are no drug interactions found between levothyroxine and omeprazole. however this does not mean that interactions cannot exist. it is important to work with your pharmacist to see if there is any new information regarding these two products. omeprazole should be taken 30 minutes prior to a meal. levothyroxine should be taken 30 minutes to one hour prior to a meal. they can be taken together with water on an empty stomach if needed. the previous answer is not only false but can lead to very serious health implications. co-administration of omeprazole/other ppis/acid reducers/etc. along with thyroid meds (whether for tsh t4 or others) can cause a drastic decrease in absorption of the thyroid medication. there are many peer reviewed studies that prove this all one needs to do is a proper google search or a subscription to any of the popular medical journals. your stomach needs an acidic environment to properly convert your thyroid medication into a usable medication to get into your bloodstream and if you take an acid reducer with your thyroid med this can cause problems. if you must take both (as i personally do because of my tsh levels reaching 24. 6 plus ulcers and cancerous polyps due to gerd) make sure you take your acid reducing medication at least 4 hours before your thyroid medication (no matter what kind it is) and make sure not to take another acid reducing medication at least 4 hours after your thyroid med. if you do not separate the acid reducers 4 hours before and 4 hours after your thyroid medication your thyroid levels will become unstable and you will need to adjust your dosage. but in order to prevent your levels from getting out of whack and potentially causing more harm just separate your meds as posted above and you should have no issue. the above answer telling you that it is okay to take at the same time is incredibly harmful. don't take my word for it (someone who has been dealing with both issues for a decade) trust the scientists that have figured this out through multiple peer reviewed studies. just a few sources proving the point of my previous answer after 2 minutes of google searches (wow was that previous post really posted by a doctor? i feel bad for their patients):    ,[],wmd
when should a woman receive evaluation for underlying causes of pregnancy loss?,currently most practitioners will not initiate an extensive medical evaluation for a single pregnancy loss since the chance of having a normal pregnancy subsequent to even two consecutive miscarriages is 80% to 90%. for women with recurrent pregnancy loss an evaluation will focus on the pattern and history of the prior miscarriages. three consecutive miscarriages would suggest a woman should receive further evaluation. thus the following tests are considered for women with three consecutive miscarriages. blood testing can be ordered to identify chromosomal abnormalities in the couple that could be transmitted to the fetus. the couple can each appear completely normal but still carry chromosomal defects which when combined can be lethal to the embryo. this type of testing is called karyotyping and it is performed on both members of the couple. a hysterosalpingogram (hsg) can identify anatomical abnormalities within the uterus. antinuclear antibody anticardiolipin antibody vdrl rpr and lupus anticoagulant are some of the blood tests used to diagnose autoimmune diseases that can cause recurrent miscarriage. as described above some of these illnesses will already by apparent to the woman and her doctor but not all cases. other antibody tests may be performed as well.,['pregnancy'],wmd

i am getting dizzy when i eat sugar and my legs also feel numb. . i am just under 5'7 and weigh 130 lbs. i am 18 and just came to college and i have had really bad allergies. i go to washington state university in pullman wa. i have also been sick the majority of the time i've been here. i have had multiple colds and had the flu once. i have been here since august and my eating habits have gotten worse but i haven't gained weight. i am starting to feel dizzy when i eat sugary foods and my legs sometimes feel numb. i also have to urinate frequently.,i am not a doctor but wanted to respond to the nutritional aspects. some of the symptoms you list such as frequent urination are symtpoms of type 1 diabetes. i'm not saying you have it but it is worth being checked out. as for the dizzy feelings after sugar it's hard to say. i would aim to eat balanced meals with a protein healthy fat whole grains and fruits and vegetables. if you eat sugar do so after a balanced meal or snack. eating sugary foods on an empty stomach may contribute to the dizzy feelings. the best possible thing to do is get a physical that includes lab work to make sure everything is okay. in the meantime focus on taking care of yourself by eating well and getting sleep.,"['urination', 'leg', 'dizziness', 'food', 'weight gain']",wmd
how do fat absorption inhibitors work? will i really have anal leakage?,this is the product alli or orlistat that's available over-the-counter and is still available as prescription known as xenical. what they do is it actually binds to fat that's in fatty foods and it absorbs it and makes it bind together so when you actually have a bowel movement it's passed through that way. so it's never really absorbed in the body the fat triazole 9:38 it's like a sponge it soaks it up. it's very safe. it is effective. the over-the-counter version is actually half of the dose of the prescription so therefore there are less treatment effects such as abdominal pain. a lot of people say that they see oil or fatty stools that's absolutely fine that's actually the medication working. what it does is it tries to train you to eat better. the alli website has a lot of great examples of menus. they even have a book that will tell you when you go to places like mcdonald's or burger king what you can and cannot eat. if you happened to have a really fatty meal you're going to know because you probably will be in the bathroom for a little bit longer than what you expected but once again it's training you to eat healthier. so they are really good product and once again all their literature is great because they advise you that you should be doing things like exercising and drinking more water using things like a pedometer tracking your progress and then also having realistic expectations. you're not going to lose 20 pounds in one month that's not really a good goal to have. gradual weight loss is the way to go and if you end up losing two or three pounds per month that's great and plus too you're changing your lifestyle. a lot of pharmacists have gotten a lot of questions about this product since it was launched in 2007 and it really has been a great way for pharmacists to get to know their patients better. come and ask us for the medication experts we're happy to help you.,['anus'],wmd

what medications and treatments are available to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder ocd?,after you are diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) your doctor will likely prescribe antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) such as fluoxetine (for example prozac ). antidepressants are thought to help balance neurotransmitters (such as serotonin) in your brain. in some cases it takes time to adjust the dosage or find the right medicine that will work for you. you may start to feel better within 1 to 3 weeks of taking an ssri. but it can take as many as 12 weeks to see more improvement. if you have questions or concerns about your medicines or if you do not notice any improvement by 3 weeks talk to your doctor. your doctor may increase the dosage of your medicine change to another ssri or use another medicine known as clomipramine if the medicine first prescribed does not help. clomipramine a tricyclic antidepressant has been used for years to treat ocd but it may have more side effects than ssris. your doctor may prescribe other medicines if you have other conditions along with ocd. medication choices antidepressants (ssris) such as fluoxetine (for example prozac) fluvoxamine ( luvox ) and sertraline ( zoloft ) are commonly prescribed to treat ocd. these medicines are taken as tablets or capsules. the medicine venlafaxine can also help symptoms of ocd. the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine ( anafranil ) is sometimes used as well. antidepressants are used to relieve the obsessive thoughts and subsequent compulsive behaviors in those who have ocd. by increasing the level of serotonin in the brain antidepressants help to regulate the communication between different parts of the brain. other medicines (such as antipsychotics) are sometimes used to treat ocd. what to think about a person with ocd may also have other anxiety disorders that complicate treatment and require using other medicines. for children and adolescents with ocd treatment combining cognitive-behavioral therapy with antidepressants (ssris) such as sertraline works better than only taking medicine. cognitive-behavioral therapy alone also works well but it works better if it is combined with medicine. 7 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

what is osteoarthritis?,osteoarthritis is a joint disease that mostly affects cartilage. cartilage is the slippery tissue that covers the ends of bones in a joint. healthy cartilage allows bones to glide over each other. it also helps absorb shock of movement. in osteoarthritis the top layer of cartilage breaks down and wears away. this allows bones under the cartilage to rub together. the rubbing causes pain swelling and loss of motion of the joint. over time the joint may lose its normal shape. also bone spurs may grow on the edges of the joint. bits of bone or cartilage can break off and float inside the joint space which causes more pain and damage. people with osteoarthritis often have joint pain and reduced motion. unlike some other forms of arthritis osteoarthritis affects only joints and not internal organs. rheumatoid arthritis  the second most common form of arthritis  affects other parts of the body besides the joints. osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis.,['osteoarthritis'],wmd

will exercising the vaginal muscles make my vagina tighter?,two ultrasound studies of women who exercised their vaginal muscles did find that their muscles were thicker and stronger after pelvic floor muscle training. among women with urine leakage their thinner muscles became the thickness of healthy women's pelvic floor muscles. additionally they had less urine leakage  whether the problem was from stress or urge types of incontinence. the use of vaginal cones and/or kegel exercises to increase muscle strength were both found to improve tone and decrease urine loss. while some of these studies did not measure vaginal tightness per se when muscle bulk is increased a woman can voluntarily contract those muscles to make the vaginal opening tighter. yes it will tighten that area. i guarentee you! contract and relax those muscles repeatedly 7 to 10 times then hold tightly/contract for as long as you can while sitting at a stop light in your car at the office watching tv or when ever you think about it and you will notice results quickly and so will your partner. if you can't always do it for that long of a time or that many reps don't worry. any added amount will make a difference. yes it will make them tighter. that's the exercise my gynecologist told me to do after i had a baby. it really worked for me my husband could tell the difference. if you don't know how to do them you hold in the muscles that you use if you had to pee for a few seconds then release then hold again. you can do them all day at your desk home or driving in your car. the more you use these muscles the quicker you'll see results. i think so yes. in addition i have found that if your legs are in good shape because you exercise regulary then it tends to tighten up your pelvic floor muscles to. just my own personal experience of course. yes it will make them tighter. that's the exercise my gynecologist told me to do after i had a baby. it really worked for me my husband could tell the difference. if you don't know how to do them you hold in the muscles that you use if you had to pee for a few seconds then release then hold again. you can do them all day at your desk home or driving in your car. the more you use those muscles the quicker your results.,"['muscle', 'vagina', 'exercise']",wmd

how are hemorrhagic fever viruses transmitted?,viruses causing hemorrhagic fever are initially transmitted to humans when the activities of infected reservoir hosts or vectors and humans overlap. the viruses carried in rodent reservoirs are transmitted when humans have contact with urine fecal matter saliva or other body excretions from infected rodents. the viruses associated with arthropod vectors are spread most often when the vector mosquito or tick bites a human or when a human crushes a tick. however some of these vectors may spread the virus to animals  livestock for example. humans then become infected when they care for or slaughter the animals. some viruses that cause hemorrhagic fever can spread from one person to another once an initial person has become infected. ebola marburg lassa and crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever viruses are examples. this type of secondary transmission of the virus can occur directly through close contact with infected people or their body fluids. it can also occur indirectly through contact with objects contaminated with infected body fluids. for example contaminated syringes and needles have played an important role in spreading infection in outbreaks of ebola hemorrhagic fever and lassa fever.,"['hemorrhagic fever', 'virus']",wmd

i am 45 and had my right fallopian tube removed due to multiple ectopic pregnancies is it possible to get pregnant. how often will i ovulate with only one fallopian tube,most helpful answer hi found you this on barycentre. com it could help or not? you ovulate from both sides if you have both ovaries. usually one side one month the other side the next but sometimes an ovary is the dominate ovary and does more then 50-50 (so you can't judge which side you'll ovulate on which is what i thought). one ovary could ovulate 8 times a year while the other only does 4 times a year. so if your good tube has the non-dominant ovary you could only get pregnant 4 times a year (or however many times it ovulates a year- from one to 12 times). the opposite tube can catch the egg but it's not likely. i only have one tube and conceived my son the first month we were trying. and from what i can read also seems that the right one is the more dominant one of the two which would not help you. you would just have to track your ovulation dates and make sure you have unprotected sex 4 days before reason its takes male sperm 3 days to get into the right place to receive your egg so 4 days means there sitting there waiting and sperm can live for up to 5 7 or 10 days depending where you read. hope this helps you. good luck,"['fallopian tube', 'ectopic pregnancy', 'pregnancy', 'ovulation']",wmd

what causes bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy?,about 20% of women have some bleeding during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. possible causes of first trimester bleeding include: implantation bleeding. you may experience some normal spotting within the first six to 12 days after you conceive as the fertilized egg implants itself in the lining of the uterus. some women don't realize they are pregnant because they mistake this bleeding for a light period. usually the bleeding is very light and lasts from a few hours to a few days. miscarriage. because miscarriage is most common during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy it tends to be one of the biggest concerns with first trimester bleeding. about half of women who bleed in pregnancy eventually miscarry but that doesn't necessarily mean that if you're bleeding you've lost the baby especially if you don't have any other symptoms. other symptoms of miscarriage are strong cramps in the lower abdomen and tissue passing through the vagina. ectopic pregnancy. in an ectopic pregnancy the fertilized embryo implants outside of the uterus usually in the fallopian tube. if the embryo keeps growing it can cause the fallopian tube to burst which can be life-threatening to the mother. although ectopic pregnancy is potentially dangerous it only occurs in about 2% of pregnancies. other symptoms of ectopic pregnancy are strong cramps or pain in the lower abdomen and lightheadedness. molar pregnancy (also called gestational trophoblastic disease). this is a very rare condition in which abnormal tissue grows inside the uterus instead of a baby. in rare cases the tissue is cancerous and can spread to other parts of the body. other symptoms of molar pregnancy are severe nausea and vomiting and rapid enlargement of the uterus. additional causes of bleeding in early pregnancy include: cervical changes. during pregnancy extra blood flows to the cervix. intercourse or a pap test which cause contact with the cervix can trigger bleeding. this type of bleeding isn't cause for concern. infection. any infection of the cervix vagina or a sexually transmitted infection (such as chlamydia gonorrhea or herpes) can cause bleeding in the first trimester.,"['pregnancy', 'first trimester']",wmd

is continuing to smoke cigarettes throughout pregnancy safer than simply quitting? . my freind's girlfriend told him that her doctor informed her that it was safer for their unborn child to continue smoking through the remaining 8 months of pregnancy rather than having her simply quit now due to the baby going through nicotine withdrawals. . no one was there with her when this happened. it sounds like bs to me but can anyone back this up. . trying to look out for my friend's unborn child so thanks everyone in advance.,most helpful answer hi her quitting and going cold turkey will benefit her and her baby straight away. throwing out her cigarettes and vowing never to smoke again may be difficult for her for a few weeks but each day she will fill better for it. but there's no evidence that the stress of suddenly quitting smoking has any effect on your baby so that would be the way for her to go. this would also benefit the baby if she carries on it could be under weight. do hope this helps. good luck,"['smoking', 'pregnancy', 'baby', 'nicotine']",wmd
i have stick my penis in a guy for 1 second what is my chances to get infected with hiv?,let's talk for a minute about how hiv is transmitted. the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) spreads from person to person by direct contact with infected bodily fluids such as semen blood or vaginal fluids. any exposure to hiv results in a risk of getting the virus yourself. however the exact risk of acquiring hiv from a single exposure isn't known. in short it's impossible to answer your question because there are too many unknown factors. if you performed an unprotected (no condom used) penile insertion with an hiv positive individual (even for just one second) then you have some risk of getting hiv yourself. if your partner does not have hiv then you have no risk of getting hiv because the virus can only be acquired from direct exposure to infected bodily fluids. that said it's never a good idea to have unprotected sex whether anally or vaginally because many other sexually transmitted diseases (stds) exist and can be spread in this way. especially if you're having sex with multiple partners you're always well-advised to use a condom  for your own protection and your partner's.,"['hiv', 'penis']",wmd

my toenails are discolored and my doctor says i have toenail fungus. will over-the-counter products fix my toenails? . i don't want to spend the money for the prescription medication lamisil if i don't have to.,fungus of the toenail always comes from fungus of the foot unless you get it from a pedicure. so if you have a true toenail fungus and you haven't had a pedicure ever and you don't have fungus of the foot then i would definitely be hesitant about that as a diagnosis. in order to take an oral antifungal like lamisil you really should have a culture of the toenail done to make sure that the fungus does grow out in culture in a nail clipping in order to make sure you have one before you treat it because not every change in the toenail even a yellow discoloration is fungus. sometimes it can be a type of eczema or psoriasis of the nail or some other type of infection. also sometimes nail polish removers can leave a yellow discoloration of the toenail. and if you add a drop of bleach to your nail polish remover that will take that yellow discoloration away. in runners i often see toenail changes especially in that first toe or the last toe and switching shoes can help as well. so not all nail changes are fungus. you need to have a known diagnosis and then you can use either an oral or a topical. i have found that neither one alone works very well to get rid of that fungus of the nail. you really need to use both together and then use a powder in the shoe or something that's going to absorb the moisture in order to prevent it from coming back. because people who are prone to it even after you cure it or you treat it appropriately it can recur. so there is really no true cure for this it's something you have to deal with over time.,['nail fungus'],wmd

im diabetic in the hospital and was given a non-diabetic meal the first morning. how can i eat right while im here?,i've generally been unhappy with the hospital food served to patients. my main complaint is too much refined starch. food is generally bland or unhealthy or both. this is a sad state of affairs because good nutrition is expecially important when ill. however a patient who is proactive can often get decent food in the hospital. the first choice is to find out the dietary restrictions required by the acute circumstances and then to have a family member or friend bring appropriate food if possible (you need permission from the doctors and nurses to do this but can often get such permission). some patients order as much food as they can get such as extra pieces of fruit or double vegetables and then pick and choose the best from what appears on the tray. in my hospital they actually offer a la carte meal service so if someone wants just protein fruit and vegetables they can do pretty well. still better to eat homemade food if possible though even if it is homemade chicken soup.,"['diabetes', 'meal']",wmd

what are the symptoms of migraine headaches?,"migraine headache symptoms vary and may occur with or without a warning sign called an aura. people who get an aura which usually begins within 30 minutes before the headache starts may see spots wavy lines or flashing lights. some people have numbness or a ""pins-and-needles"" sensation in their hands arms or face during the aura. but most people do not have an aura before they get a migraine headache. common symptoms of migraine include: throbbing or pulsating headache on one side of your head. moderate to severe headache intensity. headache that gets worse with routine physical activity. nausea vomiting or both. sensitivity to light and noise and sometimes smells. there are several types of migraine headaches each with unique features. for example some women get migraines before during or shortly after their menstrual periods. it can be difficult to tell the difference between a migraine headache and another kind of headache (such as a tension or sinus headache ). you may think your headaches are sinus headaches but it is more likely they are migraine headaches if they happen often and interfere with your daily life. unlike other headaches migraines usually occur on one side of your head although the side that is affected can shift with each new attack. migraines are also often accompanied by sensitivity to light and noise. migraines may occur along with many other conditions such as asthma or depression. more serious conditions such as tumors or infections can also cause migraine-like symptoms. headaches that are caused by more serious health problems are rare. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

how to prevent the spread of herpes?,its difficult to prevent the spread of genital herpes. many people infected with the herpes virus do not know they have it and the virus can be shed through the skin to infect other people even when no sores are present. condoms reduce the likelihood of transmission of the herpes virus but the virus can be transmitted from or to skin not covered by condoms. people who know they carry the genital herpes virus should avoid having sex when any symptoms of herpes are present. people with genital herpes can take daily suppressive antiviral medication like acyclovir or valacyclovir (valtrex); this reduces (but doesnt eliminate) the chances of infecting their partner. these are emotion-laden issues and if you have (or think you might have) genital herpes its important to get tested and discuss the issues with your partner before starting a sexual relationship.,[],wmd

having allergy problems for many years. i always have running nose or sore throat or excessive sneezing and coughing and cannot breathe normally. please help.,i totally understand your concern regarding cure of allergies. unfortunately allergy of the nose cannot be totally cured but definitely can be prevented. i would recommend the following:1. get an allergy skin test done; so as to identify the allergen. avoiding the allergen is half the solution to the problem. the allergen source could be dust sources like carpets/bedding/mattresses. avoid indoor plants/pollens. pet fur/hair is also a common cause. 2. get a ct scan of your sinuses. you could be having polyps in your sinuses; which may be contributing to your nose block. if so; your ent doctor may advise you to undergo a surgery to open up your sinuses; to enable you to breathe better. 3. taking a steroid spray regularly will give relief of your symptoms. you do need to take it for 2-3 months during the season. taking an antihistamine like allegra with steroid sprays is beneficial in moderate allergic rhinitis. 4. the latest treatment is immunotherapy; offered in some allergy centres. you can contact your local specialist for the same. it is a permanent cure; but it takes a long time for the immunity to develop. hope the above helps. if you do have a scan do share it with me and i can guide you further. keep your allergies under control; as a neglected sneeze can lead to aggravation of your wheeze. consult an ent otolaryngologist online for further help  ,['allergy'],ic

i forgot to take my birth control on saturday & sunday. on friday i had sex and the condom fell off. what should i do?,one possible course of action if you live in the us is to visit your pharmacy as quickly as possible and pick up plan b. plan b is the name of an emergency contraceptive medication that is available without a prescription to women over age 15. you must ask a pharmacist for it and show proof of age. plan b works by either preventing ovulation (the release of an egg) or by interfering with fertilization of an egg. do not confuse plan b with other types of prescription emergency contraceptives that induce a miscarriage. that is not what plan b does at all. if you have any questions consult your pharmacist. he or she also can tell you if it's safe to resume taking your birth control pills. you may also wish to consult your health care provider as soon as possible to go over what happened what you did and get back on track with your birth control pills. if you frequently forget to take your pills keep in mind there are other methods of contraception available to you including depo-provera injections and intrauterine devices (iuds). you may wish to explore one of these options with your health care provider. best of luck to you!,[],wmd

isa an iv always given for a colonoscopy? . i refuse to have an iv inserted. can the doctors still do a colonoscopy without it?,"the answer to your question is ""yes and no. "" each individual physician sets his or her own criteria under which he or she will perform a procedure. for example a dermatologist might be willing to surgically remove a mole from your face right in the exam room while a plastic surgeon may require you to have it done in an operating room. it's possible you will find a doctor who is willing to perform a colonoscopy without iv sedation. however iv sedation is the standard today and you will tolerate the discomfort of the colonoscopy better with a little sedation on board. i'm not sure why you're unwilling to get an iv. when i was an operating room nurse many of my patients expressed severe needle anxiety that made starting an iv difficult for them. if this is the case for you please know you can receive oral sedation before the iv start. this usually makes the process tolerable for even the most needle-phobic person. wishing you well!",['colonoscopy'],wmd

i only have health insurance through my husband's employer as i don't work and am 4 years younger. so if my husband quits working at age 65 he can go on medicare but i'll be 61. is there any provision for non-working spouses? (i did work for 10 years when i was younger. ),you will not qualify for medicare until you are 65 as well. you may need to get insurance through the health care marketplace (obamacare) or through a private insurance company. for about 18 months you will qualify of cobra coverage through your husband's insurance but cobra tends to be very pricy. actually all health policies often come with a sticker shock. i am currently paying a bit of $800 for just me for cobra coverage since i will not turn 65 until may. my wife is older and covered under medicare so if there were more cost-effective options i would have jumped on it. sadly we are at the mercy of an overpriced health care and insurance system.,['health insurance'],wmd
my current health policy does not cover my carpal tunnel. what happend in january 2014 if i stay with this plan?,new health plans must cover outpatient and inpatient care and other services likely used to treat carpal tunnel. i would need to know more details about your plan but i'm guessing it doesn't meet with the law's basic requirements. if that's the case you may be required to change plans. however if your plan isn't providing coverage for the care you need you may be better off shopping for a new one through your state's health insurance marketplace. you can find information about how to do that at healthcare. gov.,['carpal tunnel syndrome'],wmd
having light/mild chest pains near left brest/armpit? heart problems at 20? . hi i'm a 20 year old with a very strange pulse and sometimes very light chest pain near my armpit/breast area. my bmi is 38 (currently working on lowering) i exercise at least 4 times a week; about an 1 hour of 4-5 miles. note that i've been doing this type of regular exercise since i was 11. i've been working on eating correctly as well. i've recently quit caffeine and diet sodas replacing them with 4 cups of water. my blood pressure is 134/81. usually my resting rate ranges from 74-96 bpm.,here's a longer preview of my question with details: hi i'm a 20 year old with a very strange pulse and sometimes very very light chest pain near my armpit/breast area. my bmi is 38 (currently working on lowering) i exercise at least 4 times a week; about an 1 hour of 4-5 miles. note that i've been doing this type of regular exercise since i was 11 and some days would exercise with my partner for nearly 2 hours almost 2 times a month. i've been working on eating correctly as well (oats fruit no processed foods/sugars). i've recently quit caffeine and diet sodas replacing them with 4 or more glasses of water. my blood pressure is 134/81. usually my resting heart rate ranges from 74-80 bpm. my problem is during 2 weeks i've been experiencing high pulse rates from (94-104) and on some days a single heart flutter. sometimes during sleeping i wake with strange high pulses. a few days ago i've awaken from a deep dreaming sleep having two heart flutters and freaked out. near the end of the day i get these weird stingy/squeezy chest pains that occur near my left breast very close to the armpit. sometimes i get the same pain at the same spot in my right chest but it's much lighter than the left. my leg elbows of my arms and stomach would also have very mild/light pains that pulsate but disappear after a while. this happens when i'm resting but not when i exercise. they last from 2-20 seconds and disappear or reoccur slightly when in bed. the day before this past halloween i visited a doctor at a clinic and she basically laughed at me saying i was too paranoid and having anxiety. she checked my heart beat and breathing through a stethoscope but no more after that. she said i was too young to be having heart problems. i'm afraid of going back due to spending way too much money just to hear the same reply. this is starting to scare me and i'm very hesitant to return to my regular exercise and weight training since this has been happening. i don't think i have diabetes since i don't get the symptoms (and i'm like a hawk keeping an eye on any similar rising symptoms if i get them). should i continue with my daily activities? how about suggested foods to eat in a single day for healthy heart function? again i don't eat a lot of sugars. thank you.,"['breast', 'chest', 'heart', 'exercise', 'diet']",wmd

what happens to someone when they get athletes foot?,how athlete's foot (tinea pedis) develops and how well it responds to treatment depends on the type of athlete's foot you have. toe web infection (interdigital) toe web infections (interdigital) often begin with skin that seems moist and pale white. you may notice itching burning and a slight odor. as the infection gets worse the skin between the toes becomes scaly peels and cracks. if the fungal infection becomes severe a bacterial infection also may develop. this can cause further skin breakdown. the bacterial infection may also infect the lower leg ( cellulitis of the lower leg). toe web infections often result in a sudden vesicular (blister) infection. toe web infections respond well to treatment. moccasin-type infection moccasin-type infections may begin with minor irritation dryness itching burning or scaly skin and progress to thickened cracked skin on the sole or heel. in severe cases the toenails become infected and can thicken crumble and even fall out. if you do not take preventive measures this infection often returns. you may also develop an infection on the palm of the hand (symptoms commonly affect one hand and both feet). moccasin-type infections may be long-lasting (chronic) and are very difficult to treat. vesicular infection vesicular infections ( blisters ) usually begin with a sudden outbreak of blisters that become red and inflamed. blisters occasionally erupt again after the initial infection. a bacterial infection may also be present. a vesicular infection often develops from a long-lasting toe web infection. blisters may also appear on palms the side of the fingers and other areas (dermatophytid or id reaction). vesicular infections usually respond well to treatment. complications if untreated skin blisters and cracks caused by athlete's foot can lead to severe bacterial infections. in some types of athlete's foot the toenails may be infected. for more information see the topic fungal nail infections. all types of athlete's foot can be treated but symptoms often return after treatment. athlete's foot is most likely to return if: you don't take preventive measures and are again exposed to fungi that cause athlete's foot. you don't use antifungal medicine for the prescribed length of time and the fungi are not completely killed. the fungi are not completely killed even after the full course of medicine. severe infections that appear suddenly and keep returning can lead to long-lasting infection. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

"how to get rid of bruises on the forearms and hands. i am 62. 5 female. over the past 6 months i am getting more & more round purplish-brown spots on my hands forearms and (in one instance) on my face. i understand it is because my aging skin is thinner now and any slight bump will cause the blood vessels to break under my skin resulting in the purplish-brown ""bruises. "". is there any product proven to be effective in thickening of the skin? . could changing my diet help? . thanks.",you ask a great question and i wish i had a great answer. there is no product that can thicken up your skin so that you don't bruise as easily. sorry. of course you can use makeup to cover up some bruises but realistically speaking it's not that feasible to wear makeup on your hands and arms. obviously the regular use of blood-thinning agents like aspirin or ibuprofen can increase bruising but don't stop taking aspirin if your doctor told you to take it for heart health. some products can cause the skin to become thinner like topical corticosteroids. avoid using these products unless absolutely necessary. in the privacy of your home you may wish to start wearing gloves more frequently. gloves can act like an extra layer of skin and protect you from getting bruised due to a minor bump or scrape. you may want to consult a dermatologist to learn if there are any new products or treatments to address the issue of paper-thin skin and easy bruising. wishing you well!,[],wmd

what are the complications of having biploar disorder and being pregnant?,there is no crystal clear roadmap for women who are bipolar and pregnant. that's because few studies have been done on bipolar disorder and pregnancy. not enough is known about the risks of untreated bipolar disorder or the risks and benefits of medications. and the factors that lead to relapse during pregnancy are not entirely clear. the symptoms of bipolar disorder however can worsen during pregnancy. pregnant women or new mothers with bipolar disorder have seven times the risk of hospital admissions compared with pregnant women who do not have bipolar disorder. a 2007 study on bipolar and pregnancy has shed further light. and it has called into question a common belief that pregnancy may have a protective effect for women with bipolar disorder. the study followed 89 women through pregnancy and one year after delivery. when stopping bipolar medications six months before conception to 12 weeks after women had: twice the risk of relapse. a 50% risk of recurrence within just two weeks if they stopped suddenly. (women who had unplanned pregnancies were more likely to stop at once. ) bipolar symptoms throughout 40% of the pregnancy  or more than four times that experienced by women who continued their bipolar medications.,"['bipolar disorder', 'pregnancy']",wmd
i am 26 years old. i had met an motor-bike accident 1 year ago where i fracture my right leg. it was a kind of simple open compound fracture. surgery was done & nail/ rod were placed there. i have followed the doctor & do every things he said but bone healing doesn't occur. instead the nail start breaking after i start walking without crutches. the doctor added extra calcium supplements & waited further. but no changes. then i move to next hospital. after 8 month a prp injection was given saying it was a non-union & waited to see the reaction. no good changes. then after 11 month again surgery was done replacing the broken nail with another long & wider nail/rod. some changes were observed within 4 months. then dynamization of nailing along with prp inject was made recently. will it solve the problem? what are the chances? how long it will take to heal? can i walk without support as it has been 4 month already(except recent dynamization)?,the healing of a fractured bone depends on many factors. 1. type of fracture - compound fractures - take much longer to heal. 2. displaced bone fragments - if the bone edges and parts have been displaced then the risk of delayed union and nonunion increase. 3. infection - increases the healing time. 4. disruption of the blood flow to the fracture site - also hampers healing 5. malnutrition bone disorders also prolong the healing time. 6. early mobilization of the joint - before complete healing. in your case you have 2 or more factors which have caused the delay in your recovery. without first hand knowledge of your current condition examination of your xrays and a physical examination it would not be possible to give exact possibility of your prognosis. i am sorry about that. but platelet rich plasma (prp) does contain important cytokines and growth factors which when injected into a injured area helps to improve the rate of healing (bone formation in your case) and hence your recovery. as mentioned in your history you may already might have had some progress. hence if the fractured bone site heals completely (which will eventually happen in due time) - there is no doubt that you will be able to walk normally on the affected foot. i hope this helps.,"['recovery', 'broken bones']",eh
