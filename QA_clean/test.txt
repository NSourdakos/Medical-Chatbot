nausea vomiting and diarrhea that comes on suddenly becomes severe then begins to get better within a few days is usually due to a viral gastroenteritis (an infection of the stomach and intestine by a virus). although the influenza virus can cause these symptoms stomach flu is almost always caused by other non-influenza viruses. sometimes bacteria such as salmonella may be responsible. people with viral gastroenteritis may continue to shed virus in their stool for weeks well after the time they feel better. its likely that they can easily pass the virus on to others during this time. its best to pay extra close attention to hand hygiene for a full month after a gastroenteritis. that means thorough hand washing on every bathroom trip and keeping alcohol-based hand sanitizer around for easy use by all household members.,how long is stomach flu contagious?,['gastroenteritis'],wmd

"people with bipolar disorder experience unusually intense emotional states that occur in distinct periods called ""mood episodes.

dietary changes the most obvious means of treating lactose intolerance is by reducing the amount of lactose in the diet. fortunately most people who are lactose intolerant can tolerate small or even moderate amounts of lactose. it often takes only elimination of the major milk-containing products to obtain sufficient relief from their symptoms. thus it may be necessary to eliminate only milk yogurt cottage cheese and ice cream. though yogurt contains large amounts of lactose it often is well-tolerated by lactose intolerant people. this may be so because the bacteria used to make yogurt contain lactase and the lactase is able to split some of the lactose during storage of the yogurt as well as after the yogurt is eaten (in the stomach and intestine). yogurt also has been shown to empty more slowly from the stomach than an equivalent amount of milk. this allows more time for intestinal lactase to split the lactose in yogurt and at least theoretically would result in less lactose reaching the colon. most supermarkets carry milk that has had the lactose already split by the addition of lactase. substitutes for milk also are available including soy and rice milk. acidophilus-containing milk is not beneficial since it contains as much lactose as regular milk and acidophilus bacteria do not split lactose. for individuals who are intolerant to even small amounts of lactose the dietary restrictions become more severe. any purchased product containing milk must be avoided. it is especially important to eliminate prepared foods containing milk purchased from the supermarket and dishes from restaurants that have sauces. another means to reduce symptoms of lactose intolerance is to ingest any milk-containing foods during meals. meals (particularly meals containing fat) reduce the rate at which the stomach empties into the small intestine. this reduces the rate at which lactose enters the small intestine and allows more time for the limited amount of lactase to split the lactose without being overwhelmed by the full load of lactose at once. studies have shown that the absorption of lactose from whole milk which contains fat is greater than from non-fat milk perhaps for this very reason. nevertheless the substitution of whole milk or yogurt for non-fat milk or yogurt does not seem to reduce the symptoms of lactose intolerance. lactase enzyme caplets or tablets of lactase are available to take with milk-containing foods. adaptation some people find that by slowly increasing the amount of milk or milk-containing products in their diets they are able to tolerate larger amounts of lactose without developing symptoms. this adaptation to increasing amounts of milk is not due to increases in lactase in the intestine. adaptation probably results from alterations in the bacteria in the colon. increasing amounts of lactose entering the colon change the colonic environment for example by increasing the acidity of the colon. these changes may alter the way in which the colonic bacteria handle lactose. for example the bacteria may produce less gas. there also may be a reduction in the secretion of water and therefore less diarrhea. calcium and vitamin d supplements milk and milk-containing products are the best sources of dietary calcium so it is no wonder that calcium deficiency is common among lactose intolerant persons. this increases the risk and severity of osteoporosis and the resulting bone fractures. it is important therefore for lactose intolerant persons to supplement their diets with calcium. a deficiency of vitamin d also causes disease of the bones and fractures. milk is fortified with vitamin d and is a major source of vitamin d for many people. although other sources of vitamin d can substitute for milk it is a good idea for lactose-intolerant persons to take supplemental vitamin d to prevent vitamin d deficiency.,how is lactose intolerance treated?,['lactose intolerance'],wmd

"well it's a good question. motivation is the challenge of every person who wants to achieve a goal be it weight loss becoming an oil painter or anything else. it sounds like you may have invested too much time and effort into research. everything feels overwhelming to you right now doesn't it? don't let that stop you. at a certain point you have to take the plunge and do it. stop thinking about it and just do it. i read an interesting article in which a fitness coach said there is no such thing as ""motivation;"" there are only choices. you can choose to eat an apple or you can choose to eat a candy bar. you can choose to take a walk for  minutes or you can choose to watch tv instead. do you see the difference here? i strongly suggest you and your friend check out webmd's diet community where you can share your fears struggles goals and successes with others who will cheer you on! you are not the first person to fear getting started on the path to a healthy life and you won't be the last. meanwhile choose goals you know you can easily accomplish. for example: today i will eat one apple instead of a candy bar today i will throw away all the junk food in my house today i will walk for  minutes this week i will walk for  minutes every day i mean come on! anyone can do  minutes of exercise right? of course you can! lastly don't forget to reward yourself for meeting your goals no matter how small they may be. don't use food as a reward. even if you accomplish just one thing today download a new song to your smartphone take a bubble bath or do something else to celebrate the fact that today at least you won. you don't need ""motivation. "" you just need to take the plunge. i say go for it! wishing you well! there are no magic solutions to motivation but i am pleased that you are doing this with a friend. how about a bet? put some money on the line ($? ) or house-cleaning (if someone fails to meet their goal they have to clean the other person's house). keep in fun and make sure your goals are reasonable and achievable. start with control. cut out the things you know you are not supposed to eat and stop buying them. write down everything you eat for about a week or so (be honest! ) and try to determine the number of calories you are ingesting. make sure you are under  calories per pound of ideal body weight (your goal). any one can lose weight. there is only mismatched strategies. something tells me that you are on your way to success. i suggest that you discuss your diet objectives with a physician and also your significant other. your doctor has had positive experience in knowing what diets work and which diets usually do not work. they also will know what is the best diet for you as an individual. your medical professional is in partnership with you to ensure dietary efficacy and safety. your significant other in life is also probably your best friend will be a cheerleader in your corner and most likely will offer you the motivating support system that is routinely missing with most diets. the diet that boasts the greatest statistical success is probably ""weight watchers"". counting points is relatively easy the food is easy to obtain and online supports are built into the dietary system. do not skip meals drink plenty of water and negotiate rewards for yourself (such as new clothing) upon reaching pivotal goals. if you have a dietary setback don't let it be your reason to throw in the towel. as the old chinese proverb suggests.

a visual diagnosis of strep is wrong about % of the time so the medical provider should have done a strep test first. little white dots are not a sign of strep. strep usually has bright red petechiae (red dots). viral sore throats can have white material so that is not diagnostic of strep. even trapped food particles can appear as this white material. most sore throats are viral (especially in someone who is also coughing) and do not respond to antibiotics. one virus in particular causes mono (mononucleosis) so this should be considered as a possible cause of your sore throat if it is still painful or worse. mono usually does not need treatment but again this requires a blood test to properly diagnose. sorry about your lack of insurance but you may have to just go and pay. again or wait it out a bit longer to see if you improve. this is a decision that only you can make.,"urgent care doctor diagnosed me with strep. i took antibiotics  days as prescribed yet my throat looks the same? . y advice? there was no strep test taken she looked and knew right away it was strep. took amoxicillin for  days as prescribed and my throat looks the same. still so many little growths with white on my tonsils. and my right lymph node is still hard and swollen. i really can't afford to go back for another visit at urgent care because my insurance doesn't kick in till february. lymph node isn't tender. throat doesn't really ""hurt"" i just have a dry cough a few times a day. it just looks bad","['antibiotic', 'throat', 'amoxicillin', 'tonsil', 'lymph node']",wmd

most helpful answer janumet a medication used in type  diabetes causes weight loss. janumet is a combination medication of metformin and sitagliptin. metformin (glucophage) and sitagliptin (januvia) can each be used alone for the treatment of diabetes. janumet is indicated when diet and exercise fail to adequately control diabetes and both metformin and sitagliptin are appropriate. metformin definitely causes weight loss and sitagliptin usually results in weight loss or is weight neutral. a -week study that looked at weight loss with janumet found that the amount of weight lost was about the same for patients on metformin alone. during this -week study patients lost between .  to .  lbs. since weight loss is an important part of the treatment plan for most type  diabetics it is very helpful to use a medication that helps you go in the right direction. dont forget that diet and exercise are still the key ingredients to weight loss. talk with your provider about how you can achieve your weight loss goals and if a medication like janumet is right for you.,does janumet cause weight loss or the opposite?,['weight loss'],wmd

"remember that any fever in a newborn infant (under  months of age) needs prompt medical attention because at that age its hard to tell when a serious infection might be present. a fever is the bodys natural response to infection or other illness and will subside when the underlying process gets better. other than treating the infection (or other condition) causing it no home treatments can shorten the duration of a fever. also remember that fever doesnt always need to be treated. if a toddler is acting normally and unbothered by her fever and her temperature is less than  degrees ( degrees celsius) theres no need to treat the fever. for a fever thats high or is bothering your toddler either acetaminophen (mapap tylenol) or ibuprofen (advil motrin) are good treatments. youll need to know your toddlers weight (dont guess) and use the dosing guidelines on the package. its best to stick with one medicine if you can. if you feel you need to use multiple drugs call your pediatricians office. dont ever use aspirin to treat a childs fever as it increases the risk for reyes syndrome. if sponging with water helps your child with a fever feel better use a warm bath (not cool) with water around  degrees. i know it sounds weird but my great granny used to cut an onion in half and put one half on the bottom of each foot then cover with socks and leave them on me all night. (in addition to tylenol or advil) when i would wake up in the morning my fever would be gone (or at least drasticly reduced) and the onions in my socks would be black. she said the onions drew the fever away from the brain and other vital organs. i don't unserstand how it works but i used this on my children and now on my grands and it works every time. it helps to understand what a fever is. some of the answers on here are very misleading and aren't factual at all. a fever occurs when the body increases in temperature. most common cause of this is an infection of some kind. the white blood cells that eat the infection release chemicals that go to the brain and tell it to raise the temperature of the body. the brain has a set point for our temperature . . it is like a central heating/cooling system with a thermostat in a house. if the temp gets hot the a/c turns on. if it gets to cold the heater kicks on. and the temperature stays at . . what these chemicals from the white blood cells do is they increase the thermostat. so the brain now has a set point of  f. but the body is still .  f. so the heater kicks on. you get shivers moving of muscles fast makes heat. you feel cold and you get under covers to get warm. this is why people say they are so cold when their temp is  because the thermostat is set to  or higher. the body does this because some of the bodies defenses are activated at higher temperatures and some bacteria don't function well at higher temperatures. so they die or we kill them better with a higher temperature. so what is it when a fever ""breaks""? well eventually your white blood cells kill everything and they stop releasing those chemicals that changes the thermostat. so the thermostat changes back to . . now you have a temperature of  and your body is set to . . it is too hot. turn on the a/c. so you start sweating to cool yourself off. this is a fever ""breaking"". so when the person with the fever is sweating like there is no tomorrow it is a good thing and you can probably expect the fever to start going back down. fever is a natural defense mechanism against foreign invaders of your body. it is very normal. as long as my fever isn't over  it makes sense to me to not interfere with the natural process. even help it. if i'm running a little fever i'll get in the hot tub or a nice hot bath. fevers can be very dangerous and you should ask your doctor when those dangerous temperatures are. they are different for kids and adults. to answer the question the fastest easiest way to break a fever is with anti-inflammatory medications like tylenol and motrin. but that doesn't mean everything is all better. and by the way: water is zero calories! (in case you read the other post) don't believe any of that stuff. what i do is rub my baby down with green rubbing alcohol. it works every time. a fever is not your body fighting an infection. anything that heats up your body including heat and induces sweating causes a fever. fevers cause heat exhaustion and heat stroke as heat heats up the body inducing sweating wich causes water to be ejected from the body. you may induce a fever and prove this by simply visiting a steam room and when your sweating check your temp youll have a fever. you may also go out jogging and see when your hot and sweating you have a fever with a fever thermometer. if you do either for long periods youll eventualy drop from exhaustion enjoying before that mild to severe dehydration symptoms heat exhaustion and heat stroke and possible mild heart attacks. cardio excersize and steam rooms have been around for centuries inducing fever and not cured any disease other than treat obesity. your heartrate can generate heat and cause a fever by pumping friction wich happens during jogging just like shaking a pop can or rubbing your hands generates warmth. make sure you maintain bodyweight during a fever. if food poisioning is suspect having a person stomach pumped and an enema given may be needed if fatigue sets in. fluid calories are better during a fever its important to maintain heartrate as lowering your heartrate also induces fatigue. if a fever is starting with no fatigue water may be ok. its important to keep dry and keep cool (keeping dry to avoid chills). humans thrive in cool temp climates of - degrees thier is little life in deserts do to heat heat starves an area of water. for children its important that children playing maintain thier bodyweight during excersize/play and eat and drink and take rest breaks and normalize thier heartrate reducing sweating. if people have to loose weight then i recommend simply getting out and walking bringing food fluids before or during thier walk to avoid dehydration with rest breaks. obesity causes fever and dehydration by carrying around - lb weights. you may simulate obesity by carrying a backpack of -+ lb barebell weights and grow it daily and see what affects that has on your health. weather and activie levels can affect weight loss. people eat drink and rest to maintain thier heartrate and energy levels. in a virus or poision a fever is a response to excess blood volume wich causes your heart to pump harder and faster generating heat. you may simulate this by giving an unnecessary blood transfusion wich will likely cause a fever and may cause a mild heart attack so i wouldnt advise it. water causes weight gain at / lb a cup its a myth its zero caloric. overdrinking from dehydrationcan cause excessive urination in addition to lowering your heartrate further so cold water if a fever has started with no fatigue otherwise fluid calories.",how do you break a fever in a toddler?,"['fracture', 'fever', 'toddler']",wmd

scientists have long known that schizophrenia runs in families. it occurs in  percent of the general population but is seen in  percent of people with a first-degree relative (a parent brother or sister) with the disorder. people who have second-degree relatives (aunts uncles grandparents or cousins) with the disease also develop schizophrenia more often than the general population. the identical twin of a person with schizophrenia is most at risk with a  to  percent chance of developing the disorder. our genes are located on  pairs of chromosomes that are found in each cell. we inherit two copies of each gene one from each parent. several of these genes are thought to be associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia but scientists believe that each gene has a very small effect and is not responsible for causing the disease by itself. it is still not possible to predict who will develop the disease by looking at genetic material. although there is a genetic risk for schizophrenia it is not likely that genes alone are sufficient to cause the disorder. interactions between genes and the environment are thought to be necessary for schizophrenia to develop. many environmental factors have been suggested as risk factors such as exposure to viruses or malnutrition in the womb problems during birth and psychosocial factors like stressful environmental conditions.,can schizophrenia be inherited?,['schizophrenia'],wmd
hi this is from the canadian gov is there a temperature at which work becomes dangerous and should be stopped? the short answer is yes. both very cold and very hot temperatures could be dangerous to your health. excessive exposure to heat is referred to as heat stress and excessive exposure to cold is referred to as cold stress. in a very hot environment the most serious concern is heat stroke. in absence of immediate medical attention heat stroke could be fatal. heat stroke fatalities do occur every summer. heat exhaustion and fainting (syncope) are less serious types illnesses which are not fatal but interfere with a person's ability to work. at very cold temperatures the most serious concern is the risk of hypothermia or dangerous overcooling of the body. another serious effect of cold exposure is frostbite or freezing of the exposed extremities such as fingers toes nose and ear lobes. hypothermia could be fatal in absence of immediate medical attention. ok found you this link its from your government <link> just copy into google to the www. to open and read. good luck,can cold cause joint pain? i have been working in an office that is not protected from the elements for  months. . can cold cause joint pain? i have been working in an office with no heat for the past  month my knees and other joints hurt so bad i can hardly walk i was about - yesterday and this morning i can't even walk. is this a medical or environmental issue? . one other thing the bathroom is about a  minute walk so i dont drink as much as i should since i have a weak bladder frequently urination. i have notice and increase in smell and dark color of urine. i need relief help.,"['coldness', 'pain', 'knee', 'walking', 'drinking']",wmd

i feel sorry for your loss. your problems are stress unable to sleep at night and body pain. so basically it is your stress that is leading to other problems. stress can be managed both by medication as well as by lifestyle modifications (behavior therapy). first try lifestyle modifications which include: drink plenty of water. whenever you sit idle make it a practice to take deep breaths. include one tomato in your diet daily. add omega  fatty acid supplements. exercise outdoor regularly. exercise will help to release endorphins which will lift the mood and activity levels. breathing for relaxation - inhaling and exhaling exercise or yoga. take diets rich in protein carbohydrates and low in fats. increase the intake of walnuts hazelnut flax seeds in diet. these diets are known to be a rich source of omega fatty acids. also proper sleep hygiene needs to be practiced daily so as to help you to maintain good sleep in the long run. sleep hygiene entails following important points. adhering to a fixed sleep in and wake up time. wearing loose cotton clothes at night for sleeping. keeping the room dimly lit and well ventilated. changing room or bed temporarily. avoiding stimulant substances in the late evening or night such as coffee tea etc. and also avoid watching television or listening to music late at night. avoid eating heavy oil rich fried meals late in the evening and at night. take small frequent meals at regular intervals and dinner at  pm with good time interval between dinner and sleeping. a warm cup of hot  minutes before going to bed can help in good sleep. these lifestyle modifications will help in improvement of symptoms and you will feel better. if symptoms persist even after lifestyle changes then visit a psychiatrist. drugs like modafinil or armodafinil will help to maintain daytime alertness and will reduce fatigue. visit a psychiatrist for proper prescription of this drug. for further information consult an internal medicine physician online --> <link>,i am unable to sleep at night because of stress. please help.,['omega fatty acids'],ic
good communication can prevent affairs by keeping relationships strong. it is especially important that couples share their thoughts and feelings about each other. when couples express their appreciation of each other they highlight all that feels good. by praising your partner for accomplishments or for particular characteristics (e. g. hard working benevolent) they will feel positively about themselves and you. by thanking your partner for doing something nice for you you let them know that you value them. another important part of good communication is talking about conflicts and painful feelings. people who are emotionally close are bound to step on each others toes sometimes. when this happens its important that they talk about it. this helps the offended party by giving them an opportunity to share their experience; and hopefully feel validated and cared about by their partners response. it also helps the offending party know the effect of their action; and provides an opportunity for them to offer a sincere apology sharing their deep feelings of caring. partners can also prevent affairs by proactively staying away from situations that threaten their fidelity. while conducting couple therapy over the years ive seen how both men and women have formed innocent friendships that eventually developed into affairs. so to prevent an affair from developing it is important that people are aware of this possibility and disconnect from (or put distance in) such relationships early on. they would also do well to think about whether there is something missing from their main relationship that leaves them vulnerable to looking elsewhere — and then to work on remedying that situation. unfortunately there is no absolutely sure way to prevent affairs or to ensure that someone you love wont hurt you. but maintaining good communication and proactively protecting your relationship are two very good ways to nurture a happy monogamous relationship.,how can i prevent my partner from having an affair?,[],wmd

if tuberculosis have not done irreversible damage to the tube and endometrium (inner lining of the uterus) then pregnancy can happen either naturally or with treatment. a simplest way to check these two things is one mid-cycle ultrasound (around day  or  of menses) to see the uterine lining (anything more than  mm to  mm should be reassuring) and one tubal patency test like hsg (hysterosalpingogram). in case of damaged or blocked tubes ivf would be a better option (in vitro fertilization) as it will also reduce the chance of ectopic pregnancy. for further information consult an infertility specialist online --> <link>,how to avoid ectopic pregnancy?,['ectopic pregnancy'],ic

yes. go back to your doctor to have your foot checked. he or she will have to look at the foot to decide what is wrong. your foot has  bones. there are  long straight bones called metatarsals beneath the top of the foot. each of these ends in bones called phalanges which are the toes. tendons that move the toes are attached to these bones. any bruising or swelling in the foot can affect the ability to move the toes by pressing on these tendons. bruising or bleeding can also spread throughout the foot and up into the toes. possibilities include a bad bruise sprain or a small fracture that did not show up on the first x-ray. this is not unusual. your doctor will decide whether further x-rays or other testing is needed.,should i have a follow up on my foot? . i walked into my childs toy last friday. i hit it on the left middle of my foot. it instantly swelled up. i went to the er later that night. they took x-rays said there was not anything wrong. well now  days later all of my toes are bruised and above my toes. if i hit the side of my foot it hurts and if i walk on it too much it hurts. its still hard to bend my toes and i really don't understand what my toes have to do with that part of my foot. should i go back to the doctor?,"['bruise', 'foot', 'toe', 'x-ray', 'walking']",wmd

the cause of atopic dermatitis is poorly understood and is the subject of active research. research shows that it develops as a result of interaction between the environment your immune system and genetics (heredity). people with this condition seem to have very sensitive immune systems that are more prone to react to numerous irritants and allergens. most people who have atopic dermatitis have a personal or family history of allergic conditions such as hay fever ( allergic rhinitis ). the skin inflammation that causes the atopic dermatitis rash is considered a type of allergic response. research has shown that even the unaffected skin of people with atopic dermatitis does not hold water as well as it should.   itching and rash can be triggered by a variety of factors including: exposure to allergens such as pollen animal dander or molds. dust mites may be an allergen although experts don't know whether they affect atopic dermatitis. exposure to irritants such as using soaps rubbing the skin and wearing wool. exposure to workplace irritants such as fumes and chemicals. climate factors especially winter weather and low humidity. cold air does not contain much moisture which can result in drier skin and increased itchiness. temperature changes. sudden changes in temperature can result in increased itchiness. a suddenly higher temperature may bring on sweating which can cause itching. lying under blankets entering a warm room or going from a warm shower into colder air can all promote itching. emotional stress. emotions such as frustration or embarrassment may lead to increased itchiness and scratching. exposure to certain foods typically eggs peanuts milk soy or wheat products. up to % of children with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis also have some type of food allergy.  but experts do not agree on whether foods can cause atopic dermatitis. excessive washing. repeated washing dries out the top layer of skin leading to drier skin and increased itchiness especially in the winter months when humidity is low. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,what causes atopic dermatitis?,['atopic dermatitis'],wmd

"well my friend it sounds like you are constipated. and on top of that probably have a hemorrhoid yes. that would account for any visible red blood on the stool or in the toilet water after you have a bowel movement. while i applaud your devotion to greek yogurt i agree it's probably wise to cut back from - containers per day. eating excessive amounts of dairy products can indeed cause constipation. if you manage your constipation you can avoid further trouble from hemorrhoids. first you need to make sure you're drinking plenty of water each day. second eat a fiber-rich diet that includes a sizable portion of minimally cooked plant foods. in the short term you can take an over-the-counter stool softener (not laxative) such as docusate sodium. please do not do anything radical like a bowel cleanse. it's not necessary and can disrupt the natural flora of your gut which are important for your immune system. just read up on constipation using the link above and you should find your problems resolving within a week or two. wishing you well! let me first start by saying i am not a doctor just your fellow webmd follower and i have had crohns disease for  years and know a little something about bowel movements. two important questions: my first question is: is the blood red or black? red blood means there is irritation either from a hemorrhoid or rectal bleeding which generally is not concerning. it either means you need to start drinking more water and/or taking stool softeners. you usually can tell if you need more water by bleeding and large hard stools. my next question would be: if the blood is black or the stool is tarry this is where you need to see a doctor. this means there is bleeding up high in the colon or intestine a colposcopy is highly recommended. i suspect what you are feeling is a large hemorrhoid when you feel inside. again i hate to say it but see a doctor and/or stick to extra water stool softeners and continue with you yogurt as this will ""balance"" you. i had this problem and it turned out to be a hemorrhoid. my doctor recommended benefiber which is taste free and it actually worked. <link>",my bowel movement my stool is so hard it hurts at a  pain level. there is blood right after not much but a little. this happens every bowel movement i have had i stopped eating a lot of greek yogurt thinking that may help because it started when i started eating almost  to  containers a day. i feel like it is on the right side inside my anal cavity i have put my finger up there to check. it feels like something is there. what could this be i was thinking its bleeding because my bowel movents are so huge and hard and sometimes look like big like rocks what could this be other then a hemorrhoid?,"['bowel movement', 'pain', 'yogurt', 'anus', 'cavity']",wmd

peyronie's disease is a condition in which a plaque or hard lump forms on the penis. the plaque may develop on the upper (more common) or lower side of the penis in the layers that contain erectile tissue. the plaque often begins as a localized area of irritation and swelling (inflammation) and can develop into a hardened scar. the scarring reduces the elasticity of the penis in the area affected. peyronie's disease can occur in a mild form that heals without treatment in six to  months. in these cases the problem does not progress past the inflammation phase. in severe cases the disease can be permanent. the hardened plaque reduces flexibility causing pain and forcing the penis to bend or arc during erection. in addition to the bending of the penis peyronie's disease can cause general pain as well as painful erections. it also can cause emotional distress and affect a man's desire and ability to function during sex.,what is peyronie's disease?,[],wmd

normal urine can range in color from pale yellow (almost colorless) to deep amber. dark amber urine is usually very concentrated and means that you should be drinking more water. foods medications and even vitamins can change the color of urine temporarily but eliminating the cause brings the color back to normal. most changes in urine color are harmless and the color will go back to normal within a day or two. some colors require more attention: a reddish tinge can mean that blood is present in the urine—or it can mean that you just ate beets or blackberries (urine color tends to turn purplish red afterwards. ) if the reddish tinge continues over several days after you've eliminated foods that may be causing the color you should mention it to your primary care provider. greenish urine can mean that you have a urinary tract infection but if it's bright green it can mean that you have too much of b vitamins. certain drugs and some health conditions can cause urine to turn green too so mention this to your health care professional. urine with a bluish tint can mean some type of bacterial infection or may just mean that you have a high level of calcium. if this persists give your health care professional a call. brown urine can indicate a potentially serious condition and you should contact your doctor's office for help. sometimes laxatives can temporarily turn urine brown but if this dark color stays get it checked out.,what do the different urine colors mean?,['urination'],wmd
if you are a teenager who is pregnant here is how to ensure a healthy teen pregnancy: get early prenatal care. call your doctor for your first prenatal visit as soon as you think you might be pregnant. if you can't afford to see a doctor ask your school nurse or counselor to help you find a low-cost clinic and other resources. for example they can help you find state medicaid or wic (women infants and children) programs. stay away from alcohol drugs and cigarettes. these harm a growing fetus even more than they harm a growing teenager. if you're not able to quit by yourself ask for help from someone you trust. take a prenatal vitamin with at least .  mg of folic acid every day to help prevent birth defects. ideally this should start before you get pregnant. ask for emotional support. being a mother brings untold emotional and practical challenges -- especially for teens still in school. reach out to others -- your friends family the baby's father -- for emotional and practical support. for teenagers who are healthy and strong chances are good of delivering a healthy strong baby -- especially with early prenatal care and a healthy lifestyle during pregnancy.,how can the health risks of teen pregnancy be lowered?,['pregnancy'],wmd
brain surgery may be considered when drugs fails to control symptoms of parkinson's disease or cause severe or disabling side effects. deep brain stimulation ( dbs ) is a technique for treating parkinson's disease. it affects movement by using electrical impulses to stimulate a target area in the brain. the electrical impulses are generated by wire electrodes surgically placed in the brain. deep brain stimulation may be used in addition to therapy with levodopa or other drugs when drugs alone do not control symptoms adequately. this technique is the preferred surgical method of treating most cases of advanced parkinson's disease. it does not destroy brain tissue and has fewer risks than older more destructive surgical methods such as pallidotomy and thalamotomy.  deep brain stimulation (dbs) neither cures parkinson's disease nor eliminates the need for medicine. dbs of the thalamus is done to treat disabling tremor caused by parkinson's disease. procedures that stimulate the subthalamic nucleus and the globus pallidus control a wider range of symptoms (in addition to tremor) and are used more often than stimulation of the thalamus. pallidotomy and thalamotomy are rarely done anymore. they involve the precise destruction of very small areas in the deep part of the brain that cause symptoms. neurotransplantation surgery is an experimental procedure being studied for the treatment of parkinson's disease. it involves implanting cells that produce dopamine into the brain. information about the effectiveness of neurotransplantation is limited and it is not a proven treatment or a realistic option for most people at this time. surgery choices deep brain stimulation pallidotomy thalamotomy neurotransplantation what to think about a neurologist with special training in parkinson's disease is most often the best kind of doctor to make a decision about surgery. if you might benefit from surgery or deep brain stimulation your neurologist can refer you to a brain surgeon with experience doing these operations. surgery most often becomes a treatment option for people when parkinson's disease progresses to the point that drugs can no longer control symptoms adequately. with advanced disease existing symptoms may get worse or a person may develop new symptoms that drugs cannot control. (however when a person has severe one-sided tremor deep brain stimulation  may be considered much sooner because this symptom often responds better to dbs than to medicine. ) people who have extremely advanced parkinson's or who have other serious conditions (such as heart or lung disease cancer or kidney failure ) are not usually good candidates for surgery. surgery is usually not considered for people who have dementia or psychiatric disorders. surgery is not a cure for parkinson's disease. drugs are usually still necessary after surgery but surgery can reduce the number and amount of drugs needed to control symptoms. this reduces the side effects caused by drugs while at the same time controlling symptoms. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,what surgery options do i have for parkinsons disease?,"[""parkinson's disease"", 'surgery']",wmd

hi found this lovely piece of info on warm milk that should really help answer your question. milk contains tryptophan an amino acid that is a precursor to the sleep inducing compounds serotonin and melatonin for tryptophan to have a sedative effect it needs to enter the brain by crossing the blood-brain barrier an effective way for this to happen is to consume warm milk together with a carbohydrate (sugar). carbohydrates (sugar)and proteins in milk and heat together makes tryptophan more available to the brain this promotes the clearance of other amino acids from the bloodstream and facilitates the entry of tryptophan into the brain where it can act to produce a sedating effect. so warm over cold is still best cold is best if you have small upset stomach or some acid going round it. hope this still helps you. good luck,in the past you have advised that a glass of warm milk will help one to fall asleep. will a glass of cold milk also help. will a glass of cold milk be as effective as warm milk?,"['milk', 'coldness']",wmd

diaper rash is a common problem and i can tell you that there are a few things that parents can do to help prevent it and then there is also ways to treat it. preventing it what you want to do is make sure you change the baby frequently. you don't want them to sit in a white wet diaper all the day long and by actually cleaning the area very well and letting it air dry little bit before you put on the next diaper. you want to carry things in your house as far as wipes to make sure you clean the area throughly and use things something like desitin ointment which is a zinc oxide base. it actually will create a water-tight barrier that will help prevent moisture from staying on the skin. there is also boudreaux's butt paste which is another popular product just as good as desitin has the same active ingredient in it. if you notice though that the rash is becoming a little bit more inflamed and red seems to be spreading baby is running a fever then you want to have it checked out by your pediatrician. because they may actually need prescription medication because it could have became a little more fungal. speaking of fungal the one thing that i think a lot of parents do is put cornstarch on a baby when they are doing the diaper change and that is actually not something that you want to do. it actually help trap in fungus. so don't use any powder at all.,what are some of the best over-the-counter solutions for diaper rash?,"['diaper rash', 'over the counter']",wmd

no contraceptive method is % effective so it is always advisable to take a pregnancy test if you think that you might be pregnant regardless of the type of contraception you are currently using or have used in the past. a pregnancy test only reacts to the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg). however if you are pregnant this hormone will not be present in your urine or blood until  to  days after ovulation (the release of an egg) which is around the time that you would normally get your period. until this time has passed it will not be possible to see a positive result in a pregnancy test. urine tests require a certain level of hcg to be present in order to indicate a positive pregnancy result. blood tests are more sensitive because they can detect a smaller amount of hcg which means that pregnancies can be picked up earlier usually between six to eight days after ovulation. you can have a blood test at your gp surgery but it is recommended that you take a home urine test before booking an appointment. source :- pharmacysell,i am on the pill. i missed my last period am now on day  and just had a little bit of spotting. could i be pregnant? . i did not miss any pills last cycle nor have i in this cycle.,"['period', 'spotting', 'pregnancy']",wmd

yes i am a facial cosmetic surgeon and still make patients happy with eyelid and facelifts neck lifts and chemical wrinkle removal. but for those on a tighter budget cosmetic surgeons and dermatologists can now give you some real bang for your non-surgical bucks. here is my shortlist of the three best things you can do for that healthy younger and youthful look: . retin-a. retin-a a derivative of vitamin a should be thought of as a vitamin too. the skins own potent and unique vitamin if you will. take one a day if you will. a nighttime application of just a pea-sized amount of retin-a (available also as the generic retinoic acid) followed by application of a moisturizer (another favorite and winner; see below) will go a long way to make your skin smoother and free of minor blemishes including some of those nasty brown spots age spots. an important long-term benefit of retin-a is that it thickens the outer layer of the skin and thats important; thicker skin resists wrinkling. retin-a is available only by prescription. it comes in various strengths. consult your dermatologist or cosmetic plastic surgeon for more information and advice on use. and remember for the optimal results use it every day; dont quit! . moisturizer + sunscreen. summers here -- we need to get serious about sun protection. particularly if you live in southern ca south texas or south florida. in those hot spots the sun is strong and therefore not your skins best friend. there are many excellent moisturizer-sunscreen combinations on the market. and dont equate cost with excellence. the pricier ones have the big ticket to pay for all the marketing and advertising. what spf (sun protection factor) number should you use? the number scale was developed to indicate potency relative to elapsed time of use. divide the spf number by four to get the number of hours the product is expected to be effective. the only problem with such a general formula is that it does not take into account how heavy the application and what factors might cause the protection to be dissipated such as by sweating or water sports. best advice: pick a mid-strength product say spf ; reapply every - hours and you cannot go wrong. remember a little sun is ok; nature intended us to get some sun to produce the essential vitamin d. but benefits diminish and negatives begin to appear after even just  minutes during the summer so be conservative with your sunbathing. . botox cosmetic or dysport.  has heard about or has used botox. dysport is its new competition; practitioners vary in their preference but dont worry you cannot go wrong with either. botox has long-proven its safety and value. for the vertical frown lines between the eyebrows those horizontal forehead lines and the squint or crows feet just aside the eyes the injections are terrific. they can also be used to gently lift droopy eyebrows. yes they are not permanent but i see that as a plus. if you dont like the results or dont feel the injections –- several times a year –- are worth the cost you can drop out of the program with no negatives. if you like the results and think the cost is worth it you can continue. stay tuned. i suspect medical science which never sleeps will soon be delivering longer-lasting successors to botox and dysport.,what are some cheaper alternatives to plastic surgery for youthful skin?,"['skin', 'plastic surgery']",wmd

"many of us with fm have to work and we may be faced with a major dilemma: our fibro interferes with our jobs. this creates stress often extreme financial stress if the job cannot be performed properly. whether the fm was caused by a work injury or whether work is aggravating the pre-existing fm changes may have to be made in how work is approached to minimize pain and functional impairment. job considerations: different factors influence our job abilities. we have a difficult time reaching using our arms overhead bending lifting and being in one position for a long time. we have no business even being in some of the jobs we do since the job duties are so unrealistic for us. even jobs that involve little or no lifting may not be tolerated if it involves a lot of reaching or repetitions. some examples of ""high risk"" jobs for us include assembly-line jobs hairstyling bus driving computer work and cashier jobs. even sedentary less physically demanding jobs can be stressful because it's hard to focus concentrate and be productive if we hurt all over have headaches and brain fog etc. we can come up with a list of work things to do that's best for our fm. i mean things that we can modify at work to keep us productive and with minimal pain despite our fibro. here are some examples of things that you your doctor and your therapist can try to do. --hours: stay on day shift avoid overtime can you have a flexible schedule? decrease commute time? is part-time more feasible? can you make up missed time? --building: can you park close? use elevator instead of stairs? --work environment: can you control the thermostat? avoid drafts bright lights noise. minimize interruptions/disruptions. is your furniture and work station ergonomically efficient? --physical: can you alternate positions? sit more? lie down during breaks? pace your work? --work load: can you rotate tasks? can you prioritize deadlines? delegate to others? can you ease pressure on work quotas? are others depending on your work before they can finish theirs? --insurance: is it adequate? paid medical leave? pharmacy plan? reasonable accomodations: the employee the employer and the doctor can work together to create a safe workplace with minimal pain hopefully. the americans with disabilities act requires employers to provide equal employment opportunities for people who are able to do the job but who are limited by physical disabilities. the employee has a right to reasonable accomodations provided by the employer to help overcome any physical limitations. examples of reasonable accommodations for fm workers might include: --allowing frequent breaks during the workday --rearranging work stations and providing ergonomic tools or furniture to optimize proper body mechanics and use fibronomics. --providing phones with headsets --using a drop keyboard wrist bars and arm rests on your computer --no direct air conditioning drafts --restrictions on repetitive activities. family medical leave act: the fmla was passed to allow workers to take time off work when they (or family members) are incapacitated and require medical treatment for a serious or chronic health condition. i complete these forms often when necessary and will state that fm is a chronic condition that may unpredictably flare up from time to time resulting in impairment of work ability and may require time off work on a temporary basis. we try to prioritize returning to work and staying at work as much as possible.",how can i deal with my fibromyalgia at work?,['fibromyalgia'],wmd

trainers have developed thousands of plyometric exercises. a simple routine for children and adolescents can start with one to three sets of six to  repetitions of one upper-body exercise such as a medicine ball chest pass and one lower body exercise such as a double-leg hop on two nonconsecutive days per week. as muscle strength increases the routine can be expanded to include multiple medicine ball throws jumps and single leg-hops. plyometrics routines for qualified adults range from low-intensity double-leg hops to high-intensity drills such as depth jumps which involve jumping up to and down from boxes or benches as high as  inches. high-intensity drills can subject a participant to forces up to seven times his or her body weight. for sports that require explosive lower-body power a plyometric routine may start with ground-level jumping on soft surfaces such as padded mats or grass progress to jumping over cones or foam barriers and then advance to bounding exercises performed in straight lines and patterns.,what are examples of plyometric exercises?,['exercise'],wmd

i am very sorry to hear that you are sick but your specific question is not one that can be answered in this type of information forum. if you have had diarrhea for  days and are having severe pain you really do need to see a doctor now. symptoms such as this can have many causes ranging from a virus food poisoning or diverticulitis all the way to a surgical emergency. there is no way to tell what is going on without a physical exam and more information. any treatment will depend on what is causing your symptoms. start by calling your family doctor now. explain your symptoms. tell the doctor that you are unemployed and are having money problems. most doctors that i know will try to help you by reducing the fee or working out some type of payment plan. he or she will also know what resources are available in the area and can give you further advice. if you do not have a family doctor your city or county may have a free clinic. but this will only help you if you can be seen right away. some areas have urgent care centers that may be able to see you right away for a fee. if there is no way that you can see a doctor right now then you can go to the emergency room of your local hospital. once this health crisis has passed look into whether you can get help from the government. you are eligible for medicare if you are over . if you are younger and meet certain financial criteria you may be able to get medical assistance. i hope you get the help you need now.,do you know what i could have or best thing to fix this diarrhea that i have had for days now? . i have had diarrhea now for  days i have tryed pepto bismol and its not working. i also have severe pains and nausea with it. now im very sore and raw down there when i go it burns and hurts. what could this be or what is best to use? . any help would be appreciated because im not working and cant afford to go to doctor and get meds both.,"['burn', 'diarrhea', 'nausea', 'pain']",wmd

you're experiencing the doms effect (delayed onset of muscle soreness) which is normal. this occurs within  to  hours after a strength session and can last for a couple of days depending on how many exercises you performed. back off on the initial workload until your body can adapt to the new stress. when you work out lactic acid is produced and released within your muscles. this can last for several days. the best thing to do is to remain active (at a very low to moderate rate until you feel capable of increasing your activity level) keeping your muscles warm and stretched ultimately working out the lactic acid. also keep yourself hydrated. you can use heating pads & ice packs routinely to help increase blood flow to the area to expedite recovery/healing as well as to keep the swelling down. always stretch slowly never exceeding your comfort zone or straining yourself. if pain worsens or symptoms continue seek medical attention. that soley depends on if you're out of shape. if you don't usually work out as much as you have been these past three days then your muscles are probably just sore and getting used to the work out. i don't think so you may have over worked them by trying to excersise too much at one time but if the pain continues then you should go see your doctor about it,my muscles are still sore after lifting weights three days ago did i pull something?,[],wmd
no that is not a sign of high blood pressure. one can certainly have high blood pressure and not know it but blue lips are not a sign. most people with high blood pressure do not have any symptoms or signs so get your blood pressure checked regularly anyway. hi found you this i think this matchs up with your symptoms. medical author: melissa conrad stoppler md related symptoms & signs skin discoloration depigmentation of skin shortness of breath cyanosis is the medical term for a bluish color of the skin and the mucous membranes due to an insufficient level of oxygen in the blood. for example the lips and fingernails may show cyanosis. cyanosis can be evident at birth due to the presence of a heart malformation that permits blood that is not fully oxygenated to enter the arterial circulation. cyanosis can also appear at any time later in life and often accompanies conditions in which lung function is compromised (resulting in an inability to fully oxygenate the blood) or conditions in which the heart's pumping function is compromised. the presence of abnormal forms of hemoglobin or other abnormalities of the blood cells can also sometimes cause cyanosis. the medical term for lowered oxygen levels is hypoxia; the term anoxia refers to the absence of oxygen. pseudocyanosis is the appearance of cyanosis that is not associated with reduced oxygen delivery to tissues. most causes are related to the ingestion of metals (such as silver or lead) or drugs/toxins. do hope this helps you. good luck,when your lips turn blue and around your mouth turns blue is that high blood pressure?,"['lip', 'mouth', 'high blood pressure']",wmd

many years ago i volunteered to perform sports physicals at four local middle schools. i spent a lot of time in that nurses office and apparently so did many of the students. all day long it was a dance of complaints. since the nurses professional hands are often tied when it comes to treatment the most common disposition for a sick child is a trip home. next to tummy aches headaches were at the top of the whine list. when i think back to my own middle school days there were plenty of things that can lead to headaches. just being at school all day is a headache to some kids. fortunately for all of us most headaches are not brain tumors or aneurysms. in healthy active kids the most common type of headache that is seen is the classic muscle-tension headache. the brain itself does not feel pain but all of the sensitive nerves muscles and blood vessels of our head can certainly generate a doozie of a headache. dont get me wrong; headaches can be hallmarks of something more serious but most of the time a random self-limiting headache is just that a headache. headaches are in the body of the beholder. a medical provider cannot see a headache which makes this an ideal get-out-of-school reason. teenagers tend to be great actors and are able to give a command performance at will. some performances are so good they end up in my office. by the time i see them parents are worried about brain tumors meningitis and all types of horrible diagnoses. on a one to  scale with  being the worst headache what number do you give your headache?  if a comfortable-looking person tells me nine  and their mannerism looks more like a one or two i am suspicious. i will then inquire as to the frequency of headaches their location on the head factors that may bring on the headache and things the person does to make the headache better. the number of missed days from school is another important bit of information. i think its a migraine.  most people dont have a clue what migraine really means but will frequently self-diagnose. most feel that the word migraine just indicates a bad headache. when i explain to them that a migraine is a certain type of vascular (blood vessel) headache that usually occurs on just one side of the head usually severe accompanied by nausea/vomiting and proceeded by an aura (a feeling that a headache is imminent such as blurry/wavy vision) they will usually admit they do not have these things. migraines tend to run in families and in women may be cyclic related to menstruation. among many other triggers hormonal contraceptives can also trigger migraines in some people. younger children do a lot behavioral modeling. they see a parent constantly complaining of headaches and they may get one too. headaches located at the back of the neck or upper shoulders radiating to the scalp and feeling like your head is in a vise are usually muscle tension headaches. these can be due to sleeping on several thick pillows (flexing the neck) or sitting like a slug in those uncomfortable school desks. nervous tension like algebra tests or the day they need to run a mile in physical education all can create tension headaches. on examination i can usually find a very sore area (trigger point) around the nape of the neck and of course no clinical findings suggestive of brain tumors. parents are relieved; students not so much. sorting out real headaches from just headache complaints used to avoid something requires a lot of skill and experience. kids will get headaches when they are worried. tension at home like parents arguing or families going through a divorce will trigger headaches in kids. a physically or emotionally abusive parent will trigger headaches. bullying at school is another factor. when children are being teased or intimidated by other classmates they may use headaches as an excuse to go home. teachers can be bullies too. when i recall my elementary and middle school days there were some very unfriendly teachers in my life. teachers should always be respected but never feared. in dissecting factors that may be triggering a headache overly demanding (mean) teachers are often high on that list. rather than just prescribe tylenol or motrin it behooves the clinician and the parent to get more information. real headaches exist. serious headaches exist. even those pseudo-headaches deserve our utmost attention.,when is a headache a real problem?,['headache'],wmd

many patients with psoriatic arthritis have feelings of anxiety and isolation. these feelings of anxiety can lead to poor sleep which can result in more pain and fatigue the next day. dwelling on the anxiety and fears can lead to feelings of sadness and make you want to be alone as you stay isolated from family and friends. depending on where it is on your body psoriasis alone can be an embarrassing disease and a source of anxiety. you may feel like your psoriasis skin condition interferes with your relationships. perhaps people treat you differently because of the skin condition. new acquaintances may not understand psoriasis and feel frightened by it. even your good friends or family members may refuse your offers to help them out in the kitchen. in addition you may avoid relationships or feel like some people avoid you. when you combine the emotional toll of psoriatic arthritis with the pain and other discomfort you feel this illness can be difficult to manage on your own. coping with psoriatic arthritis can increase stress -- and then the increased stress response only worsens the skin condition. there's even some scientific evidence that worrying about your psoriasis may make treatment less effective. this can become a vicious cycle that creates even more problems including: difficulty sleeping leading to constant fatigue. inability to exercise leading to poor aerobic and physical fitness. difficulty concentrating from the side effects of medications leading to poor performance. increased irritability from lack of sleep or medication side effects. withdrawal from favorite activities because of low energy. changes in appetite due to medications. depression.,does psoriatic arthritis lead to anxiety and isolation?,"['anxiety', 'psoriatic arthritis']",wmd

some of the most common reasons anemia develops other than lack of iron are: vitamin  deficiency may cause pernicious anemia. this type of anemia could happen in people who are unable to absorb vitamin  from their intestines due to a number of reasons: strict vegetarians who may not be taking adequate vitamin supplements. long-term alcoholics. this typically causes macrocytic (large cell volume) anemia. vitamin  along with folate is a involved in making the heme molecule that is an integral part of hemoglobin. folate deficiency can be the culprit. this may also be caused by inadequate absorption under-consumption of green leafy vegetables and also long-term heavy alcohol use. there can be rupture of red blood cells (hemolytic anemia) due to antibodies clinging to the surface of the red cells (for example hemolytic disease of the newborn and in many other conditions). a wide assortment of bone marrow diseases can cause anemia. for example cancers that spread (metastasize) to the bone marrow or cancers of the bone marrow (such as leukemia or multiple myeloma) can cause the bone marrow to inadequately produce red blood cells resulting in anemia. certain chemotherapy for cancers can also cause damage to the bone marrow and decrease red blood cell production resulting in anemia. certain infections may involve the bone marrow and result in bone marrow impairment and anemia. finally patients with kidney failure may lack the hormone necessary to stimulate normal red blood cell production by the bone marrow. another common cause of anemia is called anemia of chronic disease. this could typically occur in individuals with long-standing chronic diseases. some medications can cause anemia in a variety of ways. human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (aids) can cause anemia.,what are causes of anemia other than lack of iron?,"['anemia', 'iron']",wmd

this is a great question. botox is one of my favorite treatments because it's the safest treatment that is minimally or noninvasive that has such reliable and dramatic results that look really natural. but there is a finesse to it. what's so great about botox for the face is that facial expressions happen because the muscles of your face are attached to your skin. on your hands and your elbows they are attached to tendons or bone but in your face in order to create expression the muscles are actually within the skin. so when you move the muscles move and that creates the expression. by specifically placing botox where we want where we need in order to soften that expression you can have a very natural movement. it's not a frozen look at all it's a very natural softer movement that can create balance and symmetry in the face that looks incredibly natural. so you look so much better and everyone will notice that but nobody will know why.,my eyelids sag and i have heard that botox can lift my eyelids. how does this work? won't it look strange?,['eyelid'],wmd

"what is considered normal on lab tests may not necessarily be normal for you. let me give you some background information. the test they usually perform to initially diagnose hypothyroidism is tsh or thyroid stimulating hormone. it has an inverse relationship with your actual thyroid hormone. think of it as a bill collector. if you don't respond when the bill collector knocks on your door they will start to knock on your door or call you with increasing frequency until you do respond. the tsh is the bill collector and if your thyroid ""isn't paying the bills"" aka isn't producing enough thyroid hormone (); tsh levels will continue to increase until the thyroid responds or your pituitary (master) gland decides its a hopeless cause and tsh production decreases or stops. the reason for this diatribe is because people get confused when they are told they have hypothyroidism and their tsh is too high. they don't realize the tsh is not actually the thyroid hormone (which is the hormone that will be low in this case). i just want to ensure there is no confusion when your provider gives you lab results. some providers don't realize that if your tsh is in the upper range of normal people and especially women may still have symptoms. thus you may want to work with your doctor on getting your tsh down to the lower ranges of normal (.  - approximately). . the range used to be .  to  for tsh. the national board of endocrinology now suggests the normal range be changed to .  to  because people are still having symptoms despite being within ""normal range"". i prefer to keep my tsh around  because that's when i feel normal.

as a breast cancer survivor i can share what i've learned from my experiences. i am not a medical professional i can only give my opinions. mammograms do not always detect everything but they have a very important role to play in diagnostics. dense breast tissue most often will obscure many things during mammography therefore many doctors will order an ultrasound or mri. each of these diagnostic tools have unique strengths that play vital roles in proper diagnoses. it seems you are in great hands and that your doctor is doing everything possible to rule everything out without causing delay which would only increase your anxiety. i believe in prevention in all things. i believe in early detection saves lives. most lesions turn out to be cysts. however should a different type of lesion be found the sooner the better. if it should turn out to be cancerous the earlier it is found diagnosed and treated then better the outcome. also the earlier a tumor is diagnosed the easier the treatment. mammograms do save lives! i found my tumor myself through self-exam. i have a very aggressive form of breast cancer which grows very quickly so the lump formed and grew large quickly between my annual mammograms. my diagnosis triggered my sister getting her first mammogram through which two tumors were found. mammography saved her life! mammography also brings relief and joy! two days ago i underwent my latest mammogram and two years post diagnosis i am cancer free!,i am  years old my doctor has confirmed breast nodules. should i worry that my dr. ordered both a mamm and ultrasound? . i have been told the ultrasound is usually ordered based on the mammogram results. i wondered if it was cause for concern that he was shotgunning them both at once same day one after the other.,"['breast', 'nodule', 'ultrasound', 'mammogram']",wmd

most helpful answer the key for diabetes is keeping carbohydrate intake consistent throughout the day. oatmeal is a healthy carbohydrate-rich food that is beneficial for heart health and can fit in a healthy diet. you want to work with your healthcare provider on how many carbohydrates you need in a day. the american diabetes association recommends - grams of carbohydrate at a meal (- carbohydrate servings). one half cup of oatmeal without added sugars contains about one carbohydrate serving ( grams). if you add to tablespoons raisins that is another carbohydrate serving. the benefit of carbohydrate counting is you have flexibility about what you eat as long as you stay within your recommended carbohydrate intake. but choosing carbohydrates that are nutritous like oatmeal (and other whole grains) fruits and dairy is important for a healthy diet. if you need help see a diabetes educator for more assistance. for more information on carb counting see this article <link> i am a type  and eat oats every morning. one of the first things i was taught was to add a good fat or protein to a carb breakfast. i eat / cup of steel cut organic oats cooked in water  oz. of almond milk  cinnimon and  tbs. of almond butter. i also eat one cup of fruit but eat the fruit  prior to the oats. this wait time allows the fruit to digest before the oats start to digest. i have been taught also to not eat a startch or grain carb together with a fruit as the stomach treats this combination by frementation during digestion. my blood sugars are norml eating this way. total carbs for this meal is around  which is high but eating this way negates the high blood sugars!,"i love oatmeal and i am a diabetic. is it good to eat in a regular basis? . the issue is that i read that some doctors say that oatmeal is alright but you must be careful with it as a major part of your diet but others say it is fine as long as it is not loaded up with all the ""nice"" things that make oatmeal so good like brown sugar and raisans which makes sense because of the high carbo content.","['diabetes', 'oatmeal', 'diet']",wmd

our society generally believes two is better than one. the problem is that the way condoms are designed using two condoms at the same time could actually do more harm than good. it could cause some friction between the condoms that could actually cause more breakage and leakage. so we like to let everyone know especially teens to keep it simple. just use one condom each and every time you have sex. viruses can get through some of the natural skin condoms so they don't protect against all sexually transmitted infections. we recommend the latex--or polyurethane which tend to be more expensive but need to be used by people who have latex allergies. it's important that teens recognize that the condom needs to be put on as soon as theres an erection. not waiting until there's been a little foreplay because there's ejaculate that can be released that can cause both stds and unplanned pregnancies. even though it's so important to use a condom consistently and correctly many teens don't know how. health care providers teen clinics and educational materials can provide information on how to use a condom properly.,is it true that using two condoms are better than one?,['condom'],wmd

ive just gotten through reading a new survey detailing how women feel about the o word — obesity — as it relates to themselves their children family and friends. the good news is that most women agree that obesity is a major issue. this survey was unique because its woman-centric updating us about how women currently view the impact of obesity on their daily lives. the online survey was conducted within the united states by harris interactive on behalf of the national non-profit association healthywomen. from august -    women ages  and older participated. after reviewing the survey results a number of disconnects began to emerge. here are some highlights from the survey: . although  percent of women believe that there is a parental role in the cycle of obesity only  percent assign any responsibility to themselves. fifty-seven percent believed that a mother and father have equal influence on their childs potential for obesity. reality: research shows that a mothers obesity has a much great impact than a fathers on their child at all ages. moms are still primarily in charge of grocery shopping and meal preparation. kids tend to emulate their moms eating patterns. . one in  women surveyed recognized that if she were obese in her first trimester her obesity more than doubles her childs risk of becoming obese. forty-six percent of women didnt know if there was a mother-child obesity connection in pregnancy and  percent felt there was no connection at all. reality: research from harvard medical school shows that the more weight a woman gains while pregnant the greater the childs chances are of being overweight by the age of three. currently one in five women is obese at the time of her babys conception which translates into .  million annually. . eighty percent of women believe that outside relationships can influence their becoming obese. seventy-two percent believe an obese family member can affect their obesity risk. sixty percent think that a spouse or partner will significantly impact on their becoming obese or not. less than one in three believes an obese friend can influence their weight. reality: research shows that a woman has a greater chance of becoming obese if her friend does. there is a less effect for sibling or spouse. . while  percent of women knew that obesity is associated with an increased risk of heart disease and diabetes only: a) thirty percent knew that it was also associated with gallstones and infertility; b) twenty-five percent knew it could increase the risk of colon and breast cancer; c) and only  percent knew about the obesity-uterine cancer connection. the bottom line from this survey is that all women need to embrace and integrate these new facts into a new normal attitude about healthy lifestyles.,are women realistic about obesity?,['obesity'],wmd
"shingles (herpes zoster) are an outbreak of rash or blisters on the skin that is caused by the same virus that causes chicken pox - the varicella-zoster virus. the first sign of shingles is often burning or tingling pain or sometimes numbness in or under the skin. you may also feel ill with fever chills headache or upset stomach. after several days a rash of small fluid-filled blisters reminiscent of chickenpox appears on reddened skin. the pain associated with shingles can be intense and is often described as ""unrelenting. "" anyone who has had chickenpox is at risk for shingles. scientists think that in the original battle with varicella-zoster some of the virus particles leave the skin blisters and move into the nervous system. when the varicella-zoster virus reactivates the virus moves back down the long nerve fibers that extend from the sensory cell bodies to the skin and cause the characteristic blisters of shingles.",what is shingles?,['shingles'],wmd

most helpful answer yes you can. in fact anyone who has had chicken pox can get shingles in the future. that's because shingles is caused by the same virus that causes chicken pox. like chicken pox shingles is caused by the varicella zoster virus. once the virus has gotten into your body it gives you chicken pox. after you've recovered from chicken pox the varicella zoster virus lies dormant (inactive) in your system. if it ever re-activates it causes shingles. shingles can occur any people of any age but the rate of shingles increases as you get older. according to the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) about half of all shingles cases occur in people over age . there is a vaccine available to protect people age  and over from getting shingles. if you do get shingles your doctor also can treat the symptoms of the outbreak with various medications. if you're over age  i suggest you talk with your health care provider about whether or not the shingles vaccine is right for you. hope this helps! yes anyone who has had the chicken box can get shingles. yes! you don't want shingles believe me it is horrible. get the shot.,i got chicken pox at  old can i still get shingles?,['shingles'],wmd

having low potassium is not always due to diet but fluid balance. that's because potassium along with sodium helps regulate body fluids (they are called electrolytes) so when fluid changes occur with certain disease states or medications like diuretics it can go too low or high. diet cannot always correct changes in potassium so working with your doctor on the appropriate medical management will be key. if you are getting worse call your doctor to see if you need to go in earlier. it is important to know which foods have potassium and how to balance your intake which this webmd article discusses in detail. also eating well moderate exercise and good sleep will only help you feel better. hope you feel better soon! finding the cause for your low potassium needs to be the first objective. here is a list of some possible reasons for low potassium: . ) sometimes low potassium is a symptom of some other problem. for example having low magnesium l evels can be a contributing cause for low potassium. it may be difficult in these cases to stabilize potassium levels until magnesium levels are increased. routine serum blood studies do not always uncover low magnesium. . ) consuming foods that are insufficient or lacking in nutrients necessary to maintain potassium at an optimal level can be a real challenge. yes consuming foods that are rich in required nutrients is a worthy objective. but due to hectic life styles and the frequent fast eating of fast foods your diet may come-up lacking in potassium. . ) some medications can cause low potassium levels. be especially careful in taking laxatives and diuretics which can deplete potassium levels. . ) electrolyte imbalances as seen with vomiting and diarrhea can also cause potassium levels to plummet. . ) some digestive irregularities as seen in conditions like crohns disease gluten sensitivity issues and irritable bowel syndrome can cause fluid loss and ultimately to cause low potassium levels. . ) drinking alcoholic beverages to excess drinking large amounts of tea coffee and soda can cause excessive urination and result in potassium depletion. here are my recommendations as a lay person who has had family members suffering the negative effects of having low potassium levels : - start a food diary listing as best you can (with only a few days until your follow-up appointment) all foods and beverages that are being ingested. also annotate any physical or emotional symptoms like excessive sweating feeling anxious muscle cramps lightheadedness thirst and overall body weakness. - for the immediate time follow your doctor's plan of action. keep that appointment with your doctor to follow -up with the results achieved. - show your diary to the doctor along with an updated list of all prescription medications and over the counterdrugs. that person has been highly trained in nutrition pharmacology and medical conditions. digestive problems absorption defects low magnesium levels and many other problems may be uncovered by your physician who is also a diagnostic detective. - once the cause of your low potassium level is determined then an effective treatment plan may be started. hi this first bit is from the uk paper the daily mail. this is an interesting question because although potassium is rarely in the limelight we actually need it in higher amounts than any other mineral - around   a day by adult men and women. potassium plays a fundamental role in maintaining the fluid and acid/alkaline balance of the body. it is vital for the transmission of nerve impulses and helps the heart to beat regularly. it also counterbalances sodium in the body and is known to help lower blood pressure. to get enough you need to eat plenty of fruit and vegetables which are especially good sources because they also provide a low level of sodium. (health-wise it's a high potassium to sodium ratio that really counts). however several other foods also provide potassium including whole bread and pasta brown rice milk fish and meat. the dietary and nutritional survey of british adults (hmso ) showed that the average intake of potassium is   in males and   in females. compared with the daily recommendation of  intakes they are therefore low. to make up the difference eat an extra banana or two daily - each banana contains around . people most at risk of marginal potassium include the elderly athletes and manual workers who sweat out a lot of potassium and people taking certain diuretic drugs. heavy coffee and alcohol drinkers may lack the mineral and should try to increase their dietary intake i think from this and other stuff around with your supplements you should be getting there but keep of any fast foods junk foods and sodas just keep eating healthy. do hope this helps good luck ps the extra urination is from all the fruit your eating same as the soft stools.,what can i do to increase my potassium? . i already take a potassium supplement. so i am taking two a day now. i also was already eating several bananas a week. i am eating at least one a day now. i already eat pretty much all of the foods that contain potassium so i don't know what to do. i am doing this by doctors orders but am now more tired than ever and having soft stools and frequent urination too. i go back for more tests in a few days but don't feel better at all (worse actually). what else can i do? !,"['potassium', 'supplement', 'food', 'urination']",wmd

with obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) you develop disturbing obsessive thoughts that cause fear or anxiety. in order to rid yourself of these thoughts and relieve the fear you perform rituals such as repeated hand-washing or checking that something has been done. unfortunately the relief is only temporary. the thoughts return and you repeat the rituals. the rituals or behaviors become time-consuming and have a significant impact on your daily life. if your particular fear involves unfamiliar situations it is possible for you to become so obsessed by the fears that you stop going outside of your home. quality of life can be substantially lowered by ocd since it can greatly affect your ability to work and have relationships. many people are too embarrassed by their symptoms to seek treatment and they go for years before seeing a doctor. symptoms of ocd can be reduced with treatment. ocd can have a negative effect on those who care about you. family members can become angry and frustrated at the strain the rituals or behaviors put on them. talk to your doctor about ways your family members can help with ocd. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,what happens to someone when they get obsessive-compulsive disorder ocd?,['obsessive-compulsive disorder'],wmd
red. orange. yellow. green. blue. purple. look around and pay attention to the color you see. is it bright and vivid? better or worse than yesterday? now think about how well you slept last night. or the night before. could it be that your ability to see colors depends on a good nights sleep? now this is fascinating stuff: research just emerging and presented at the  annual meeting of the associated professional sleep societies (apss) earlier this month suggests that sleep literally colors your view of the world. put simply sleep restores your ability to see and process colors correctly. the technicality of how this all works (and how the researchers went about figuring this out) is pretty complex but suffice it to say that color perception — whether or not you see gray or green for instance shifts while youre awake thus distorting what color youre really seeing. and overnight sleep brings your color recognition back in line with whats really there. so when you see gray you can be sure its in fact gray and not green. according to the authors scientists had not previously investigated how sleep might affect the way we see the world around us. but ill point out that other recent research has discovered that our ability to recognize and remember faces is indeed influenced by the amount of sleep we get. these two abilities (distinguishing color and faces) are not so different when you consider the science behind sleep and our memory banks. sleep has a profound effect on our memories. its well-documented for example that sleep plays a big role in helping us to: * remember things. * learn new information. * process data efficiently. * consolidate memories. (in fact its believed that dreams may play a special role in that consolidation though we dont know exactly how that all works yet. ) and of course we need to have sharp memories in order to recall colors and different faces — relationships that we learn. just as you learn to know that red is red and green is green you also learn which faces belong to your best friend first grade teacher and mother. what i love about this latest study is that it examines an aspect of life so prized by humans: being able to see a spectrum of color. this skill has enhanced human interactions for millennia helpful to not just social interactions but in some cases survival. granted some people who are truly color-blind dont have trouble getting through life. but if given the opportunity i think most people would prefer to see all the colors of the rainbow clearly. even if seeing color doesnt always equate with survival it sure makes life more exciting and in a word vivid. so the next time you cant distinguish blue from green so well (and youre bickering with a significant other over whether or not that tie is blue-gray or green-gray) ask yourself: did you get a good nights sleep? keep that memory sharp. enjoy the beauty of the world around you. keep up the good nights.,can sleep affect how well i see and remember things?,['vision'],wmd

"" in other words almost as soon as your immune system attacks them they die off. other pathogens are stronger (more virulent) and are better able to fend off immune system attacks. in general pathogens can be spread through direct contact through the air through water and through other organisms (such as when you get malaria from a mosquito bite). the method of transmission is unique to each type of pathogen. in the scenario you describe let's say someone deposits a pathogen on a vending machine button. let's say it's a hardy pathogen that can reside on the vending machine button for several days before it dies off. each time a person touches the sample containing cells with the pathogen some of those cells stick to the person's finger. eventually all of the pathogenic cells either will have stuck to someone's finger or will have died naturally due to exposure on the metal. if you are the  person to contact a live pathogen and pick up even one cell theoretically you could contract an illness from the pathogen. but it depends a lot on how virulent the pathogen is how healthy the person is and so on. your example illustrates why hand-washing is so important. your best defense against transferring a pathogen from a vending machine button to your nose for instance is by washing your hands frequently with good old soap and water. wishing you well!",how exactly do infections/pathogens spread? i am curious as to how far that spread goes. i've know you can spread germs by touching food which people eat. but that's one contact. random example:. if something has worm eggs on it and someone touches it then touches someone's hand; that  person touches a vending machine button; a  person touches the button grabs food and eats the food; will that last person be at a significant risk of infection (not a fraction of a percent risk)? or do worm eggs not go  degrees of separation (and if not how many degrees do they go? )?,['worm'],wmd
this is a great question and it's really easy for me to answer because of the fact that percocet is a what we call schedule ii. its actually a stronger pain medicine than the other one and in some states there are specific laws and that's why it requires that special type of prescription. now they are used to treat pain but it depends on what that person's pain level is. so i always make sure that my patients are going to a pain specialist and that their pain is being reassessed on an annual. possibly quarterly basis because what we have learned in pain patients is that how i judge pain and how you judge pain are completely different. we are also learning through some dna technology that some people who have pain may take these medications and they may not work at all because their dna has certain triggers in it that it makes their medications just not work. so therefore we have to figure out what are other options to treat their pain more effectively. so a great question. once again though with pain we want to make sure it's individualized. make sure that you are using the one pharmacy get to know your pharmacist and make sure that all of your medications are on a medication list. so if you happen to get a prescription for another pharmacy and come back to my pharmacy i can make sure that there is no duplications things are not taken at the same time and ask you how you are doing and see if this is really helping your pain.,what's the difference between oxycodone with apap  mg/ mg and hydrocodone with apap  mg/ mg?,"['oxycodone', 'acetaminophen', 'hydrocodone']",wmd

risk factors for getting gallstones include: obesity. this is one of the biggest risk factors. obesity can cause a rise in cholesterol and can also keep the gallbladder from emptying completely. estrogen. women who are pregnant or who take birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy have higher levels of estrogen. this can cause a rise in cholesterol as well as a reduction in gallbladder motility. ethnic background. certain ethnic groups including native americans and mexican-americans are more likely to develop gallstones. gender and age. gallstones are more common among women and among older people. cholesterol drugs. some cholesterol-lowering drugs increase the amount of cholesterol in bile which may increase the chances of developing cholesterol stones. diabetes. people with diabetes tend to have higher levels of triglycerides (a type of blood fat) which is a risk factor for gallstones. rapid weight loss. if a person loses weight too quickly his or her liver secretes extra cholesterol which may lead to gallstones. also fasting may cause the gallbladder to contract less.,what are the risk factors for gallstones?,['gallstone'],wmd

probably what happened is whats called a penile fracture. it really isnt a break like the break of a bone. but theres two chambers within the penis that hold the blood the corpora cavernosa. and its a very thin-walled structure that becomes very distended very tense and thats where the rigidity of the erection occurs. in certain rare circumstances the torqueing the stretch on that is enough to pop and crack one of those chambers. classically the man will experience severe excruciating pain sudden disappearance of the erection horrible pain with blood the penis will become purple cracking sound and close but almost excruciating pain and thats a surgical emergency. they have to stop what theyre doing and go immediately to the emergency room. it may require surgical intervention. the risk of that is because of the risk of the scar from the healing of the tear men can end up with curvature and even permanent impotence. the good news is its fairly rare almost always occurs in very aggressive wild sex usually women on top what happens is the penis comes out vaginal vault but goes back in and misses hits the pubic bone in the woman and thats enough for the organ to pop.,i heard a crack while having sex and now ive lost my erection.,"['sexual intercourse', 'erection']",wmd

most helpful answer i addressed your question on the ear nose and throat community. unfortunately i have no way to confirm if your roommate has a mole or an abscess inside her ear but a mole does not suddenly occur within hours of a scratch; a skin abscess can form. the fact that this skin lesion is constantly draining is the real concern. it needs to be properly diagnosed and treated. since i can't examine your roommate i cannot determine the true nature of this draining lesion. sorry. her sinuses do not drain in her ears but they can drain down the back of her throat. there is an opening of the eustachian tubes in her throat but this fluid will not drain up into the ear. the ear has the potential of creating its own fluid that can become stagnant.,growth inside ear with fluid draining from same ear occured hours after a scratch inside ear it's been  year since. my roommate has a growth that the doctor claims is just a mole but she claims it happened within hours after sticking something in her ear and accidentally scratching it. it's been a year since it happened and she claims that she has had fluid draining from ear since. she also complains of a burning pain and swelling in her facial sinus cavities which she swears is related. she says she can feel it draining from the sinuses to her ear. is that even possible? what could growth be other than a mole?,"['cavity', 'ears', 'sinus', 'swelling', 'mole']",wmd

there are many ways that people with epilepsy and their families can help with research on this disorder. pregnant women with epilepsy who are taking antiepileptic drugs can help researchers learn how these drugs affect unborn children by participating in the antiepileptic drug pregnancy registry which is maintained by the genetics and teratology unit of massachusetts general hospital (see section on pregnancy and motherhood). people with epilepsy that may be hereditary can aid research by participating in the epilepsy gene discovery project which is supported by the epilepsy foundation. this project helps to educate people with epilepsy about new genetic research on the disorder and enlists families with hereditary epilepsy for participation in gene research. people who enroll in this project are asked to create a family tree showing which people in their family have or have had epilepsy. researchers then examine this information to determine if the epilepsy is in fact hereditary and they may invite participants to enroll in genetic research studies. in many cases identifying the gene defect responsible for epilepsy in an individual family leads researchers to new clues about how epilepsy develops. it also can provide opportunities for early diagnosis and genetic screening of individuals in the family. people with epilepsy can help researchers test new medications surgical techniques and other treatments by enrolling in clinical trials. information on clinical trials can be obtained from the ninds as well as many private pharmaceutical and biotech companies universities and other organizations. a person who wishes to participate in a clinical trial must ask his or her regular physician to refer him or her to the doctor in charge of that trial and to forward all necessary medical records. while experimental therapies may benefit those who participate in clinical trials patients and their families should remember that all clinical trials also involve some risks. therapies being tested in clinical trials may not work and in some cases doctors may not yet be sure that the therapies are safe. patients should be certain they understand the risks before agreeing to participate in a clinical trial. patients and their families also can help epilepsy research by donating their brain to a brain bank after death. brain banks supply researchers with tissue they can use to study epilepsy and other disorders.,how can i help research on epilepsy?,['epilepsy'],wmd

it doesnt seem like anyone really knows exactly why some people yawn during or after exercise but there are some theories. one thought is that you may be trying to get more oxygen. think about what a yawn actually is; a long deep breath of air. this deep breath may serve as a means to get more oxygen into your body which makes sense because exercise can make your body oxygen-deprived. yawning can also increase heart rate and blood pressure helping to increase the cardiac output that your heart might need during exercise. some research suggests that yawning could actually provide a cooling effect as a way to regulate your core body temperature after exercise as well. of course you may just be yawning because youre fatigued or sleep deprived or it could be a side effect of some medications too. there really isnt one single answer as to why we yawn during or after exercise. excessive yawning may be the sign of an underlying health condition however so please consult your doctor for further guidance. iron deficiency,why do i yawn after - minutes of exercising?,['exercise'],wmd

kudos to you for recognizing it is not safe to take pravastatin (or any cholesterol-lowering medication) while pregnant! obviously you should discuss your pravastatin use and your desire to conceive with your health care provider. in general pravastatin has a short half-life of about two hours which means about two hours after you take it only half the dose is still circulating in your blood. if you completely discontinue pravastatin it will gradually leave your bloodstream altogether. there's no way to tell when the drug has completely left your system and every individual's body eliminates drugs at a different rate so your best bet is to have a discussion with your health care provider to see how long you should wait before trying to conceive. best wishes on this exciting time in your life!,how long does pravastatin stay in your system after you stop taking the medication? . i am interested in becoming pregnant again. i have stopped taking my pravastatin and want to know when it is safe to try and conceive.,['pregnancy'],wmd

pimple is somewhat hormonal and due to oily skin. remember the following measures to control pimples. do not use hair oil and avoid oily foods chocolates and milk products. do not use any steroid creams. face wash and soaps are not the treatment and they do not help. do not touch the acne and avoid pressing it. regarding treatment of pimple i suggest clindamycin (clintop faceclin or clear gel). this is more of preventive and curative so i tell patients to use it all over face in the morning and use adapalene gel (adapalene or differin) over acne in the night. i also suggest you to take tablet doxy (doxycycline)  mg once in a day. consult your doctor discuss with him/her and take the medicine with consent. if you have acne marks avoid direct sunlight exposure as much as you can. wear sunglass cap and cover exposed part of your body all the time use sunscreen thrice in a day such as  am  pm and  pm. it has to be applied all over the face. sunscreen spf (sun protection factor) should be around . use anti-pigmentation cream over pigmented parts like kojic acid hydroquinone depiwhite cream etc. in the night. ideal treatment is glycolic acid peels. sittings of six to eight peels must be required. post acne scars are three types. box scar ice-pick (pinpoint scars) and rolling scars. pinpoint scars are difficult to treat while box scars are easy. no cream or tablet can help you out in scars. best technique is  fractional laser and subscision. it takes five to six sitting but results are better than any other procedure. dermaroller and subscision are also other methods but less effective than the above. fillers do have hiding effect. it fills the pits and gives impression of fullness and it is not permanent. if scars are not much prominent then peels also could be effective. these are technique you can go through. all procedures take four to five sitting and five to six months for better results. for further information consult a dermatologist online --> <link>,how to remove pimples and the scars on my face?,['acne scars'],ic

use a condom for goodness sake! stop playing sexual roulette with your girlfriend. you may be fine this time. i don't know. but it is only a matter of time before she will become pregnant. maybe next time. viable sperm can be present in seminal fluid and that sperm can remain alive for a week or so. while a woman can only become pregnant a few days a month sperm do not understand that. many will just wait around hoping that an egg (ovum) will appear. you will sleep better if you keep all of your penile emissions. the seminal fluid and your ejaculations well-contained in a condom. and since you and your girlfriend are clearly having regular sex she could benefit from using an effective form of contraception as well. the short answer is yes and no. yes she can get pregnant from pre-cum and no she cannot get pregnant the day or two after her period ends. the long answer is as follows: using a condom and/or birth control will help keep your minds at ease and are likely your best method for not having an unwanted baby. most health departments will offer both at little to no cost. if it is true that her period ended on friday then it is highly unlikely that she will become pregnant day after pill or not. sperm can live for - hours in the female body. most will die off en-route searching for an egg however it only takes one egg and one sperm. a woman's cycle works like this. period starts and triggers a turn of events. the lh phase is the phase when her body is not fertile typically - days from the day the period starts depending on her specific cycle. then the fertile days come in to play. for about - days her body will be in a fertile state but typically it is the last two days of this particular cycle when she is most ready to get pregnant. once this phase is over her body prepares to have another period to shed the lining that has built up to accept the pregnancy. i would suggest getting an app on her phone that tracks her cycle and her most fertile times of the month. mostly because i don't see you two using a condom or birth control no matter how many people tell you that you should. at least this way you two will have a better understanding of where her body is at and when its at that point to try and keep from getting pregnant. it can take about three months to get the app lined up with her cycle to track the days with the most accuracy. please keep in mind that this is for a woman with a 'normal' cycle however even with an abnormal cycle it is highly unlikely to get pregnant within a few days of ending a period. this information comes from personal experience with tracking my own cycle to achieve pregnancy which i have done successfully. best of luck to you both! i would say you can be . % certain that she will not get pregnant. you guys may want to consider a better form of birth control however!,can a girl get pregnant from precum the day after her period then taking the morning after pill. i had sex with my gf twice this weekend. once on sat night and once sun morning. i did not use a condom nor did i cum inside of her. she just got off her period the day before we had sex. i was worried so i had her take the morning after pill. she also took the morning after pill last month for the same incident. should she be ok not getting pregnant since i didnt cum inside her and she took the pill?,"['sexual intercourse', 'period', 'pregnancy', 'condom', 'morning after pill']",wmd

having a baby is one of the most important events in a woman's life. women considering pregnancy are encouraged to start planning for the pregnancy with their doctors early. this early planning process is called pregnancy planning. the goals of pregnancy planning are to create a healthy environment for the fetus and to prevent birth defects and other pregnancy-related problems to the greatest extent possible. the issues addressed during pregnancy planning include nutrition vitamins body weight exercise avoidance of certain medications and alcohol immunizations and genetic counseling. even though many women will have normal pregnancies without any planning pregnancy planning improves the chances of a smooth pregnancy and a healthy baby. unfortunately more than % of pregnancies in the u. s. are unplanned and many more women who are anticipating conceiving do not seek prior medical consultation. public education is important to improve pregnancy planning. pregnancy planning can help prevent exposure of the mother to potentially harmful medications or substances during the early days of pregnancy. the baby's organs begin developing as early as  days after conception and the fertilized egg begins to grow even before the first day of the missed period. some women continue to have light bleeding that may be mistaken for a menstrual period during the first few months of pregnancy and may not even realize that they are pregnant. others may not recognize that they are pregnant until they experience a weight gain or abdominal enlargement. by then they may have already been exposed to medications or substances potentially harmful to the fetus. in addition to avoiding medications and substances that are potentially harmful to the fetus other important health issues are addressed during pre-pregnancy planning. conditions such as diabetes high blood pressure kidney disease thyroid disease and heart disease in the mother are controlled to optimize pregnancy outcome. the status of the woman's immunity against german measles (rubella) and varicella (chickenpox) is also determined. women lacking rubella antibodies are immunized before conceiving. women who are not immune to varicella (chickenpox) can be vaccinated but should wait  days after vaccination before becoming pregnant. women who are carriers of the hepatitis b virus can be identified by blood tests and their infants can be protected from hepatitis b infection by immunizations at the time of delivery. women with hiv infection should take certain medications during pregnancy to decrease not only their risks but those of the fetus as well.,what is pregnancy planning and why is it important?,['pregnancy'],wmd

the fact is that with or without health-care reform we're facing a doctor shortage in this country. the association of medical colleges anticipates a   shortage of primary-care doctors – the medical professionals who play perhaps the most central and critical role in the success of reform -- by . with an additional  million americans expected to gain access to health insurance that trend along with other factors contributing to the shortage is only expected to grow. affordable care act and jobs so what's being done? the law outlines a number of programs to support the development of   new primary-care health providers over the next five years just as a start. some of those efforts include: * creating additional spots in primary-care residency programs. * increasing the number of trained nurse practitioners who are central to the delivery of primary care. * providing funds to train additional physician assistants who practice medicine under the supervision of a physician. * providing grants to states to create innovative programs to grow their primary-care work force. * scholarships and loan repayment programs for doctors (who often graduate medical school saddled with debt). * promoting medical residency (training) programs in rural and other underserved areas and offering tax benefits to medical professionals who work in underserved areas. shifting our approach beefing up our medical work force is critical but it's not likely to be enough to meet the coming demand. as a result the law also calls for a shift in the way health care is practiced. for example there are a number of pilot projects that will test new medical practice models aimed at helping doctors and nurses better manage the care of people with chronic health conditions. these projects will emphasize a team approach in primary-care settings as well as ongoing relationships between patients and primary-care providers. stronger coordination among primary and specialty care and greater participation on the part of the patient and his or her family will also be encouraged. putting money on the line encouragement won't come in the form of a pep talk and a pat on the back; the goal is to financially reward providers for keeping people healthy. that's a switch from the system that predominates today -- a fee-for-service model -- in which doctors are paid only when they provide a service. that encourages more services not necessarily better or more appropriate care. under reform the idea is to switch to a bundled or salary-based payment model whereby providers will earn greater financial rewards as quality of care and the health of those they treat improves. sounds simple but this represents a major shift in the way our system currently operates. will it work? that remains to be seen.,will the new health-care law cause a shortage of doctors if more people are insured? what is in place to help that?,[],wmd

hcv is spread (transmitted) most efficiently through inadvertent exposure to infected blood. the most common route of transmission is needles shared among users of illicit drugs. accidental needle-sticks in health care workers also have transmitted the virus. the average risk of getting hcv from a stick with a contaminated needle is . % (range % to %). prior to  some people acquired the infection from transfusions of blood or blood products. since  all blood products are screened for hcv and cases of hcv due to blood transfusion now are extremely rare. hcv also can be passed from mother to unborn child. approximately  of every  infants born to hcv-infected mothers become infected with the virus. a small number of cases are transmitted through sexual intercourse. the risk of transmission of hcv from an infected individual to a noninfected spouse or partner without the use of condoms over a lifetime has been estimated to be % to % finally there have been some outbreaks of hcv when instruments or sharp tools have been reused without appropriate cleaning between patients. transmission of hcv can be prevented in several ways. programs have been aimed at avoiding needle sharing among drug addicts. needle exchange programs and educational interventions have reduced high-risk behaviors. however drug addicts are a difficult population to reach and rates of hcv remain high among addicts (% of younger users). among health-care workers safe needle-usage techniques have been developed to reduce accidental needle-sticks. newer syringes have self-capping needle systems that avoid the need to manually replace a cap after drawing blood and reduce the risk of needle-sticks. there is no clear way to prevent transmission of hcv from mother to child. persons with multiple sexual partners should use barrier precautions such as condoms to limit the risk of hcv as well as other sexually transmitted diseases. monogamous couples should consider the low risk of transmission when deciding whether to use condoms during intercourse. some couples may decide to use them and some may not. screening tests for blood products have almost eliminated the risk of transmission through transfusion estimated by the cdc to be less than one in two million transfused blood products. people with hcv should not share razors or toothbrushes with others. it is critical that physicians and clinics follow manufacturer's directions for sterilizing/cleaning instruments and that disposable sharp instruments be discarded properly. it is important to realize that hcv is not spread by casual contact. thus shaking hands kissing and hugging are not behaviors that increase the risk of transmission. there is no need to use special isolation procedures when dealing with infected patients.,how is hepatitis c virus spread and how can transmission be prevented?,"['hepatitis c', 'virus']",wmd

hi here's a bit of info i found its interesting being it's about re-cum. can i get pregnant from pre-cum? pre-cum or pre-ejaculatory fluid to call it by it's correct name is a clear fluid that appears on the tip of the penis when a man has an erection and is sufficiently sexually excited. it is a common misconception that this fluid is semen that has leaked out before the main ejaculation. this is incorrect because this fluid is produced by something called the cowper gland and it's purpose is to flush out the penis before ejaculation. so can you get pregnant from pre-ejaculatory fluid (pre-cum)? well. as this fluid does not contain sperm it can't by itself cause a pregnancy. however as the purpose of this fluid is to flush out the penis it will bring any sperm left in the penis from the last ejaculation to the tip of the penis. if this happens that small amount of sperm could cause a pregnancy. if the man has urinated since his last ejaculation the urine would have flushed out and killed any left over sperm in the penis which means in this case a pregnancy wouldn't happen. the safest thing is to assume that an erect penis is always capable of causing a pregnancy even before an ejaculation so cover it with a condom before it comes in contact with the vagina. good luck,can i get pregnant from precum while ovulating? . i'm having some symptoms but haven't missed my period which should start tomorrow. i'm having cramps achy boobs increased mucous tightness round the lower part of my stomach some nausea. i've been tracking my cycle n its predictable now so i usually just have cramps n that's it. me n my friend always use the pull out method but this time i was ovulating n i feel odd with all these symptoms.,"['pregnancy', 'ovulation', 'period', 'cramps', 'tightness']",wmd
the sequence of events here is a little unclear to me. it sounds like you had your gallbladder removed recently and also have other symptoms that sound unrelated to your gallbladder problem. if you had your gallbladder removed recently and you have three or four small incisions (including one in your belly button) then you had laparoscopic surgery. during this procedure several small incisions are made in your abdomen and instruments are inserted through them. to make this process work your abdomen is inflated with harmless carbon dioxide gas. the unfortunate side effect of this gas is post-surgery bloating and sometimes pain. at times the pain can occur in the shoulder area. this is normal and should go away within several days. vomiting after gallbladder surgery also is not uncommon. if you follow a lower-fat diet it should help with the vomiting issue. if you had gallbladder surgery recently you should be scheduled for follow-up appointments with your surgeon. please keep these appointments. your surgeon will be able to tell you if your recovery is progressing normally. the pimples and sores in your underarm thigh and nipple area do not sound like they're related to your gallbladder issues. digestive system issues usually do not manifest as skin problems. i would suggest you consult a dermatologist (or even your primary care physician) to take a look at these lesions to find out what they are and what's causing them. i hope this helps and wish you all the best!,after surgery i am still bloated (pressure) acid reflux and now constipation what gives? . i never had the pain associated but vomited everything i ate. went from  to now  lost all first  months but went a year before surgery for lack of insurance. during that year began to have frequent fevers and sores resembling pimples without heads on my underarms thigh area and chest closer to the nipple areas. i feel this is all linked and afraid of more than just gallstones maybe more with digestive system? please help becoming concerned and afraid of doctors?,"['digestive system', 'head', 'nipple', 'surgery', 'insurance']",wmd

the symptoms of heart failure are related to the changes that occur to your heart and body and may be moderate to severe depending on how weak your heart is. the symptoms can include: congested lungs. fluid back up in the lungs can cause shortness of breath with exercise or difficulty breathing at rest which is often worse when lying flat in bed. lung congestion can also cause a dry hacking cough or wheezing. fluid and water retention. less blood to your kidneys causes fluid and water retention resulting in swollen ankles legs and abdomen (called edema) and weight gain. symptoms may cause an increased need to urinate during the night. bloating in your stomach may cause a loss of appetite or nausea. dizziness fatigue and weakness. less blood to your major organs and muscles makes you feel tired and weak. less blood to the brain can cause dizziness or confusion. rapid or irregular heartbeats. the heart beats faster to pump enough blood to the body. this can cause a fast or irregular heartbeat. if you have heart failure you may have one or all of these symptoms or you may have none of them. in addition your symptoms may not be related to how weak your heart is; you may have many symptoms but your heart function may be only mildly weakened. or you may have a more severely damaged heart but have no symptoms.,what are the symptoms of heart failure?,['congestive heart failure'],wmd

it is very hard when a loved one is no longer able to communicate her needs to her caregiver. in this case you need to be sure that she is safe and not in any pain or discomfort. a checkup with her doctor is the first step. the doctor will need to know how long she has been upset at night and if there have been any changes to her care or surroundings that could help explain her behavior. persons who have dementia are often more confused and frightened at night or in unfamiliar surroundings. after a thorough exam the doctor will be able to discuss a care plan that can help both of you. this constant care and lack of sleep can put a lot of strain on the caregivers. your local area council on aging or state department of aging can provide resources to help you cope. webmd also has a slide show that may help called  ways to prevent caregiver burnout. <link> i'm sorry to hear you and your loved one are going through this. it's hard to help when a person can't communicate. i'd suggest you have your loved one checked out by a doctor. whenever an elderly person exhibits odd symptoms the first thing that comes to mind is a urinary tract infection (uti). while these often cause delirium in a patient (as opposed to the physical actions you're describing) it might be a good idea to rule out a uti. at the same time a health care provider may be able to shed some light on why your loved one is exhibiting these symptoms. perhaps she's having pain she can't communicate. it's hard to tell without a physical exam and a knowledge of her medical history. i wish you both all the best!, year female. scratching wringing hands rubbing legs and arms crying sounds without tears. emotional no sleep. female is very distraught and cannot communicate her problems. she is up all night and better during the day.,"['arm', 'hand', 'leg', 'crying']",wmd

unfortunately my answer is: many things could cause this. floaters in the eye aren't uncommon. these tiny flecks of tissue can well float through your vision from time to time. the condition is usually harmless but in some cases can point to more serious underlying eye problems. so if this visual disturbance is a new symptom you should visit an ophthalmologist soon to get it checked out. migraine headaches also can include a component of visual disturbance called an 'aura. ' if you're experiencing the visual distortion you describe with a headache you'd be well-advised to see a medical professional for treatment. occasionally the type of symptoms you're describing can be an indicator of something serious like retinal detachment. if the symptoms are severe or you notice them getting rapidly worse please go to an emergency room. these conditions need to be treated promptly. otherwise you might start with your primary care provider or an eye doctor to see if you can get to the bottom of what's going on. good luck!,what causes moving visual distortions?,['movement'],wmd

patients with celiac disease are at risk for some nutritional deficiencies including folate deficiency  deficiency and iron deficiency. celiac disease patients are also at risk of developing low bone mineral density (osteoporosis). there are two reasons for nutritional deficiencies in celiac disease patients: the diseased small intestine causes a lack of absorption of vitamins and nutrients. strict gluten restriction can also lead to nutritional deficiencies. many of the gluten-free foods are not fortified or enriched with vitamins or minerals. studies have also shown that gluten-free products are often low in b vitamins calcium vitamin d iron zinc magnesium and fiber. fortunately there are blood tests that your physician can do to determine if you are deficient in any nutrients. it's important to be aware of what deficiencies you are at risk for and to make every effort to avoid these deficiencies. the deficiency in nutrients does not mean a deficiency in calories. there is an increased incidence of obesity in persons with celiac disease who are following a gluten-free diet. the dietary goal is to follow a well-balanced diet with appropriate supplements when needed and an adequate amount of calories for maintaining a healthy weight.,are there any dietary deficiencies associated with celiac disease?,['celiac disease'],wmd

resveratrol which is a compound found largely in the skins of red grapes has gained a lot of media attention and has been touted as having many beneficial health effects. resveratrol is a component of ko-jo-kon an oriental medicine used to treat diseases of the blood vessels heart and liver. it came to scientific attention during the mid- as a possible explanation for the french paradox — the low incidence of heart disease among the french people who eat a relatively high-fat diet. since then it has been touted by manufacturers and examined by scientific researchers as an antioxidant anti-cancer agent and phytoestrogen. it has also been advertised online as the french paradox in a bottle.  if you do a literature search and look at well-accepted peer review journals there is very little published to support any of these effects of resveratrol. new work produced by both amgen and pfizer has cast doubt on the manner in which the health supplement is said to work. prominent researchers supposed that it worked by activating a certain gene . this activation is thought to produce the benefits of a caloric restriction diet even among those with high fat and high caloric intake. in  in chemical biology and drug design amgen scientists published experimental results that indicate resveratrol does not in fact activate . pfizer scientists in the journal of biological chemistry in  offered similar results showing that resveratrol (and related substances such as ) do not active  and did not reduce blood sugar in mice fed a high-fat diet. thus it suggests that resveratrol doesnt work at all (though its not possible to translate mice studies into human studies). despite what is promoted on many national television shows on health none of the claims has been demonstrated in any valid human study. while present in other plants such as eucalyptus spruce and lily and in other foods such as mulberries and peanuts resveratrols most abundant natural sources are vitis vinifera labrusca and muscadine grapes which are used to make wines. it occurs in the vines roots seeds and stalks but its highest concentration is in the skin. the resveratrol content of wine is related to the length of time the grape skins are present during the fermentation process. thus the concentration is significantly higher in red wine than in white wine because the skins are removed earlier during white-wine production lessening the amount that is extracted. grape juice which is not a fermented beverage is not a significant source of resveratrol. since wine is the most notable dietary source it is the object of much speculation and research. resveratrol is also available from supplement pills and liquids in which it is sometimes combined with vitamins and/or other ingredients. it is also an ingredient in topical skin creams. the supplements are generally labeled as containing from  to  mg per tablet or capsule. however the purity of these products is unknown. and because dietary supplements are loosely regulated it should not be assumed that the labeled dosage is accurate.,does resveratrol really work?,[],wmd

the flu is caused by the influenza virus. doctors classify the virus as influenza type a and type b each of which includes several subtypes or strains. type a is usually responsible for the annual outbreaks that typically occur in the late fall and early winter. the influenza virus changes often so having flu caused by one strain does not give you full immunity to other strains. widespread outbreaks of the flu usually follow significant changes (called antigenic shifts) in the virus and occur about every  years. people who get the flu tend to become much sicker when a shift in the flu virus occurs. minor changes in the virus (called antigenic drifts) occur nearly every year. the virus is spread from person to person through: direct contact such as shaking hands. small droplets that form when a person sneezes or coughs. contact with objects such as handkerchiefs that have been in contact with fluids from an infected person's nose or throat. when are you contagious? people who have the flu are most likely to pass it to someone else from  day before to  days after symptoms develop. children may be infectious for up to  days before symptoms develop. symptoms usually develop  to  days after you are infected. because symptoms may not develop for a couple of days you may pass the flu to someone before you know you have it. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,what causes influenza?,['flu'],wmd

most helpful answer having a retained object in the rectum is no laughing matter. i understand why you'd feel scared. women face similar feelings about retaining tampons so you definitely are not alone. if you're very concerned that the condom is still inside you your best bet is to seek medical attention. let me assure you any health care professional worth their salt will treat your problem with dignity and concern. you need not feel embarrassed about this. if an otherwise healthy person were constipated and retaining stool in the rectum the obvious answer would be to use a liquid-based laxative such as magnesium citrate or polyethylene glycol (brand name miralax). however anyone with any medical condition compromised immune system or dehydration should not use these preparations without medical supervision. if you experience any abdominal bloating vomiting or fever please seek medical attention immediately. good luck to you!,how can you remove a condom that could possibly be stuck inside your buttocks? . i am not % sure if it is still inside me as i had gone to the bathroom and was not able to see if it came out. please help. would i still feel it? what would it feel like? will it come out by itself? how long would that take? im scared.,"['buttocks', 'fear', 'vision', 'condom']",wmd
otorrhea (fluid leaking from the ear) is most likely from a ruptured eardrum (not as serious as it sounds) but of course this is just a guess since i have no way of examining him. the ciprodex should help but many medical providers would also use an appropriate oral antibiotic. there is absolutely no way to determine (even if i could examine him) the duration of this drainage. it will stop as the rupture heals. fever rarely concerns me. it is just the body's way of fighting the infection. fever alone is not an indication to rush the er so if your child is comfortable just wait until monday and speak with the ent. of course you know your son the best so use your best judgment in this case.,ear infection with leakage and fever. my  yr. old has an ear infection with fluid leaking from his ear and  temperature. he has an ent and we have been putting in ciprodex drops in his ear for the past  days. the fever went away for a couple of days but now it is back in full force. the leakage has not stopped ( hours) and is pretty heavy at times. how long will the leaking last and should i be worried that the fever is back? it is saturday evening and his ent won't be back until monday. should i take him to the er?,"['fever', 'ears', 'ear infection', 'temperature']",wmd

it sounds as though you are taking very good steps to prevent osteoporosis. exercise has a wide variety of beneficial health effects. however exercise does not bring about substantial increases in bone density. the benefit of exercise for osteoporosis has mostly to do with decreasing the risk of falls probably because balance is improved and/or muscle strength is increased. research has not yet determined what type of exercise is best for osteoporosis or for how long. until research has answered these questions most doctors recommend weight-bearing exercise such as walking preferably daily. you are also right in not smoking. smoking cigarettes decreases estrogen levels and can lead to bone loss in women before menopause. smoking cigarettes can also lead to earlier menopause. in regard to calcium it is recommended that premenopausal women take   mg of calcium in their diet each day. unfortunately surveys have shown that average women in the united states are consuming less than  mg of calcium per day in their diet less than the recommended amounts. additional calcium can be obtained by drinking more milk and consuming more yogurt cottage cheese and calcium-fortified foods such as orange juice or by taking calcium supplement tablets. before taking calcium supplements check with your doctor. calcium supplements are generally avoided if one has had kidney stones. an adequate calcium intake and adequate body stores of vitamin d are important foundations for maintaining bone density and strength. vitamin d helps the absorption of calcium from the intestines. vitamin d comes from the diet and the skin. vitamin d production by the skin is dependent on exposure to sunlight. active people living in sunny regions (southern california hawaii countries around the equator etc. ) can produce most of the vitamin d they need from their skin. conversely lack of exposure to sunlight due to residence in northern latitudes or physical incapacitation causes vitamin d deficiency. in less temperate regions such as minnesota michigan and new york skin production of vitamin d is markedly diminished in the winter months especially among the elderly. in that population dietary vitamin d becomes important. when a women becomes menopausal estrogen supplementation is considered. menopausal hormone therapy (previously referred to as hormone replacement therapy or hrt) has been shown to prevent bone loss increase bone density and prevent bone fractures. it is useful in preventing osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.,besides not smoking exercising and eating a calcium-rich diet what else can i do to lower my risk of osteoporosis?,"['osteoporosis', 'calcium', 'exercise', 'smoking', 'diet']",wmd

"i can address your bppv concerns but unfortunately it is not possible to predict how long you might have symptoms (assuming you were correctly diagnosed). bppv has an annoying habit of coming back. bppv is an inner ear problem. it does not cause palpitations or ""head rush"" and is not related to neck disorders so these symptoms are not likely associated. benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (bppv) is the most common cause of vertigo. the patient usually has episodes of recurring vertigo lasting several minutes or as brief as  seconds. specific movements of the head often provoke the attack usually following a brief delay of several seconds. people quickly realize the specific head motion or motions which tends to trigger an attack. there are effective treatments but you may need to see an ent. look up and do the eply maneuver! on one side or both. i got it suddenly and severely with projectile vomiting-it was awful! the doctors and hospial were basically useless and this one move absolutely fixed it. some people only need to do it once--i needed to do it about  times in a row (  or  minutes in between) - and it works unfailingly! do it! you will cure the vertigo-it reattaches the ear chrystals! let me know and pass it around ok? be well! it will go away after a few seconds or minutes depending on the severity. there are those however which recur from time to time. i suggest doing half somersault maneuver which has been devised by dr. carol foster. you can just google "" half somersault maneuver "" or visit halfsommersaultmaneuver. com for a detailed process of the diy exercise.",i had an episode of vertigo two weeks ago it was diagnosed as bppv how long will it take to go away? . i have occasional head rushes and palpitations i also have a dullache inthe back of my neckandfeel like i'm in a fog most of the time. could these symptomsbe caused by my neck?,"['benign paroxysmal positional vertigo', 'head', 'neck', 'vertigo', 'palpitation']",wmd

its difficult to determine causation/correlation in this instance. some studies have shown that there may be a correlation between creatine and high blood pressure but there may not be enough evidence yet to support causation. a function of creatine is that it can withhold water in your muscles; and having more water in your body can raise blood pressure. for this reason diuretics (water pills) for example are commonly prescribed to alleviate high blood pressure by eliminating excess water and sodium from your body. accordingly it makes sense to think that creatine could raise blood pressure. i would encourage the individuals that you speak with to discontinue supplement use while monitoring any changes in their blood pressure. there can be many factors that influence blood pressure but if they discontinue supplement use and dont notice any change in blood pressure after some time then creatine may not be the culprit. regardless if they already have high blood pressure supplementation is not recommended because both creatine and high blood pressure can cause kidney problems. excess protein in your diet can also cause kidney problems as well. it may just be prudent to discontinue supplement use altogether as long as their blood pressure isn't within normal limits. of course i would always encourage that you suggest that they speak with their doctor first before taking any supplements. my response is also just for learning purposes and is not meant to replace medical advice from a physician. read more about creatine here.,can taking protein supplements (to increase muscle mass) increase blood pressure? . i am a health coach at an organization that deals with worksite wellness. some participants who work out and take protein supplements creatine for example sometimes have a higher blood pressure. can taking these supplements increase blood pressure? or is there not any correlation at all?,"['muscle', 'protein', 'blood pressure']",wmd

""complex migraine "" is a term used to identify rare types of migraine headaches that have specific symptoms not usually associated with a common or classic migraine. for example a classic migraine usually starts with a visual disturbance (called an ""aura"") and then proceeds to a painful headache. a complex migraine may fall under one of these types: hemiplegic which includes temporary paralysis or weakness on one side of the body (often mimicking a stroke) retinal which includes loss of vision in one eye basilar artery which usually affects young women and includes symptoms such as confusion and difficulty speaking ophthalmoplegic which includes pain and paralysis of the muscles surrounding the eye status migrainosus which is a severe migraine that lasts for days it sounds like you may have experienced a hemiplegic migraine or a basilar artery migraine. just because you had one migraine doesn't mean it will ever happen again. that's the tricky thing about these headaches. often doctors will wait to treat a patient until they've had multiple migraines over a course of time. that may be why you were sent home without any treatment. if you have any questions about your migraine experience i suggest you follow up with your primary health care provider. he or she can help you understand what happened and if you need treatment. wishing you all the best! i had basically the same thing happen to me. i was driving in high holiday traffic during december on the bqe in nyc for my nieces' baptism. all of a sudden i was going numb on left side of my face and scalp as well as feeling weak but had no pain. then bam my eyesight went and came back. i panicked and managed to pull over. i had no idea what was happening to me. i thought i was having a stroke and my heart was racing because i panicked. so it felt like a heart attack. my boyfriend drove us the rest of the way and i went to the er to be checked out. i had an mri cat scan echo blood drawn for tests etc. i was vamped pricked and prodded by  different doctors. then the neurologist saw me and said he thinks i had an atypical complex migraine headache and a mild panic attack. i was told to avoid several things. all of which lead to migraine headaches and for me most are not avoidable but some are. thing such as chocolate too much sleep too little sleep caffeine stress alcohol smoking extreme fatigue skipping meals and bright or flickering lights. you better believe that the things this doctor listed pretty much was like a check list for my  hour drive. i worked a  hour shift skipped dinner drank   oz cups of coffee and had a chocolate bar all while arguing over navigation issues with the bf. also was stressing because i was the god mother and if we were late to the church my sister would never forgive me. i was also surprised to learn that when i would get stressed at work i would get a mild headache with a tick or fluttering eye muscle and ""floaters"" in my eye and that it was a migraine but with out the pain. i now keep a headache or migraine diary and try to figure out what my triggers are. the biggest ones for me are sleep stress and caffeine. just know that you aren't alone in this and you might never even have another one again. it helps to just take care of yourself and avoid caffeine/stress.",what are complex migrains. i had an incident at work where my right arm went numb i had problem speaking for a few seconds and felt like i might faint. i was in the hospital for  days undergoing stroke tests. i was diagnosed with complex migrains and was told that it produces stroke symptoms. what exactly or as close as i can get is a complex migraine and how can i treat it without medication?,"['migraine', 'stroke', 'arm', 'lightheadedness']",wmd

both magnesium and potassium are used for many different biological reactions within the body and are vital for life. however just as other elements and vitamins there is a range that is important for functioning. too little and the body doesnt function. too much can cause toxicity issues and side effects. dietary magnesium does not pose a health risk however pharmacologic doses of magnesium in supplements can promote adverse effects such as diarrhea and abdominal cramping when taken in excess. risk of magnesium toxicity increases with kidney failure when the kidney loses the ability to remove excess magnesium. very large doses of magnesium-containing laxatives and antacids have been associated with magnesium toxicity. symptoms for hyperkalemia or too much potassium include irregular heartbeat nausea and slow weak or absent pulse. ultimately too much potassium can stop the heart. certain medical conditions or medications raise your risk of developing problems from potassium so consult your doctor before taking supplements. it is important to take all medications prescriptions and supplements as directed. never take more than the recommended dose.,can you take too much magnesium or potassium?,"['potassium', 'magnesium']",wmd

there are a number of ways to treat gallstones though most gallstones are silent. if silent gallstones are discovered in someone age  or older the chance of developing symptoms from the gallstones is only %(or less assuming a life span of  years. in this instance it is reasonable not to treat the individual. among younger people no treatment also might be appropriate if they have serious lifethreatening diseases -- for example serious heart disease -- that are likely to shorten their life span. on the other hand in healthy young people treatment should be considered even for silent gallstones because the chances of developing symptoms from the gallstones over a lifetime is higher. once symptoms begin treatment should be recommended since further symptoms are likely and more serious complications can be prevented. cholecystectomy cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder surgically) is the standard treatment for gallstones in the gallbladder. surgery may be done through a large abdominal incision or laparoscopically through small punctures of the abdominal wall. laparoscopic surgery results in less pain and a faster recovery. cholecystectomy has a low rate of complications but serious complications such as damage to the bile ducts and leakage of bile occasionally occur. there also is risk associated with the general anesthesia that is necessary for either type of surgery. problems following removal of the gallbladder are few. digestion is not affected and no change in diet is necessary. chronic diarrhea occurs in approximately % of patients. sphincterotomy and extraction of gallstones sometimes a gallstone may be stuck in the hepatic or common bile ducts. in such situations there usually are gallstones in the gallbladder as well and cholecystectomy is necessary. it may be possible to remove the gallstone stuck in the duct at the time of surgery but this may not always be possible. another way to remove gallstones in the duct before or after cholecystectomy is with sphincterotomy followed by extraction of the gallstone. sphincterotomy involves cutting the muscle of the common bile duct (sphincter) at the junction of the common bile duct and the duodenum in order to allow easier access to the common bile duct. the cutting is done with an electrosurgical instrument passed through the same type of endoscope that is used for ercp. after the sphincter is cut instruments may be passed through the endoscope and up into the hepatic and common bile ducts to grab and pull out the gallstone or to crush the gallstone. it also is possible to pass a lithotripsy instrument that uses high-frequency sound waves to break up the gallstone. complications of sphincterotomy and extraction of gallstones include the general anesthesia perforation of the bile ducts or duodenum bleeding and pancreatitis. oral dissolution therapy it is possible to dissolve some cholesterol gallstones with medication taken orally. the medication is a naturally-occurring bile acid called ursodeoxycholic acid or ursodiol (actigall urso). bile acids are one of the detergents that the liver secretes into bile to dissolve cholesterol. ursodiol reduces the amount of cholesterol secreted in bile. the bile then has less cholesterol and becomes capable of dissolving the cholesterol in the gallstones. there are important limitations to the use of ursodiol: it is only effective for cholesterol gallstones and not pigment gallstones. it works only for small gallstones less than  centimeter-.  centimeter in diameter. it takes one to two years for the gallstones to dissolve and many of the gallstones reform following cessation of treatment. due to these limitations ursodiol generally is used only in people with smaller gallstones that are likely to have a very high cholesterol content and who are at high risk for surgery because of ill health. it also is reasonable to use ursodiol in people whose gallstones were likely to have formed because of a transient event for example rapid loss of weight since the gallstones would not be expected to recur following successful dissolution. extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (eswl) is an infrequently used method for treating gallstones particularly those lodged in bile ducts. eswl generators produces shock waves outside of the body that are then focused on the gallstone. the shock waves shatter the gallstone and the resulting pieces of the gallstone either drain into the intestine on their own or are extracted endoscopically as in sphincterotomy.,how are gallstones treated?,['gallstone'],wmd

"there are two major reasons for very prolonged/heavy periods: hormonal and what i call ""structural. "" ""structural"" means when excessive bleeding is due to actual problems within the cavity or walls of the uterus. some examples of this would include fibroids of the uterus endometriosis of the muscular wall of the uterus (""adenomyosis"") infections of the lining of the uterus polyps of the uterine lining or even uterine cancer. hormonal causes are usually linked to missed or erratic ovulations. as you may know in a normal cycle estrogen is produced all month. estrogen is responsible for building up the lining of your uterus so you have something to shed each month. in a normal cycle progesterone production increases following ovulation. progesterone ""stabilizes"" the uterine lining in preparation for a possible implantation of a new pregnancy. if you are not pregnant that month the levels of estrogen and progesterone fall triggering the release of the uterine lining—your period. so if you do not ovulate the estrogen build up of the lining continues but without the usual ovulation associated progesterone. thus the hormone levels don't decline and the lining stays up inside the uterus—your missed/late period. alternatively the lining can begin to shed under its own weight producing prolonged bleeding. another way inadequate progesterone production from missed ovulations can create too heavy a flow is as follows. simply stated if the uterine lining is like grass or lawn estrogen is like the fertilizer (causes proliferation and a thickening of the lining ) and progesterone is like the lawnmower (keeps the lining thin by three different mechanisms). this is why depoprovera (high dose synthetic progesterone) brings about a thin lining and why birth control pills (relatively progesterone dominant) bring about shorter lighter periods. it is also why women who miss ovulations (no progesterone produced) are at a greater risk for too thick lining. causes for not ovulating are multifold: thyroid problems pituitary problems ovarian cysts physical stressors (e. g. sudden increases in exercise crash dieting) emotional stressors (problems with spouses kids job money) increased body weight anorexia rotating shifts at work etc. if they are sending you for an ultrasound that can accomplish two things. an ultrasound should be able to visualize fibroids of the uterus or suggest polyps. an ultrasound can also measure the thickness of your uterine lining. a very thick lining can suggest a hormonal cause like missed ovulations. an ultrasound should be able to visualize an ovarian cyst if that was the cause of missed ovulations. lastly . as we age ovulations tend to decrease--or if they occur the amount of progesterone produced may be less. structural causes such as fibroids or polyps also tend to be more common as we age. hopefully you will get a more ""for sure"" answer after your ultrasound.",why do i have heavy bleeding for - weeks when i get my period? my doctor is supposed to send me for an ultrasound.,"['period', 'ultrasound']",wmd

well i think the first thing you need to do about your insomnia is look and see if theres anything that you could be doing to contribute to it. is your bedroom a good environment for sleep? how much caffeine are you drinking? uh what is your stress level or anxiety level and are you doing anything to reduce that like exercise proper nutrition things of that nature. if youve looked at all of those areas of what i call disordered sleep and everything seems to be working pretty well i think the next step is to talk with your physician about what are some of the different things that can be done for people who have insomnia. and i dont want people to think that the only thing you can do is take a sleeping pill for insomnia because thats really not the case. the data is very consistent that cognitive behavioral therapy is just as effective as many of the medications on the market and actually lasts longer. cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is where youre taking a look at peoples thoughts surrounding insomnia their cognitions what do i think about sleep and changing those thoughts to be more positive as opposed to negative and thereby allowing people to have a better experience sleeping and knowing and understanding enough about their sleep to know that everybody has a bad night of sleep once in a while and thats an okay thing. that thereby allows you to reduce your anxiety and oftentimes fall asleep. and what would that be?,what can i do about my insomnia?,['insomnia'],wmd

your (or your child's) symptoms of type  diabetes probably developed quickly over a few days to weeks. these symptoms are caused by blood sugar levels rising above the normal range (hyperglycemia) and include: frequent urination which may be more noticeable at night. if your child has already learned to use the toilet he or she may have started wetting the bed during naps or at night. the kidneys are trying to get rid of the excess sugar in the blood. in order to do that they have to excrete more water. more water means more urine. extreme thirst and a dry mouth. this happens if you lose through frequent urination enough water to become dehydrated. weight loss. this happens because you are dehydrated. weight loss may also happen if you are losing all of those sugar calories in your urine instead of using them. increased hunger. you feel hungry because your body is not using all the calories that it can. many of them are being excreted in urine. blurred vision. your vision may blur when sugar builds up in the lens of your eye. the sugar sucks extra water into your eye which changes the shape of the lens and blurs your vision. fatigue. you feel tired for the same reason you feel hungry. your body is not using the calories you are eating and your body is not getting the energy it needs. all of these symptoms will get better or go away when your blood sugar levels are controlled. if your blood sugar rose to very high levels at the time you were diagnosed with diabetes you may have received treatment in a hospital for diabetic ketoacidosis which is an emergency. what symptoms might i have now? now that you are taking insulin injections watch for signs of either high or low blood sugar. high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) usually develops slowly over a few days or weeks. but it can also develop quickly (in just a few hours) if you eat a large meal or miss an insulin dose. on the other hand low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ) can develop within  to  minutes. children especially very young children are at greater risk for harm caused by very low blood sugar levels. watch for the following symptoms of high or low blood sugar. you (or your child) may not have the same symptoms every time and you may have symptoms that are not listed. symptoms of low blood sugar include sweating weakness and inability to concentrate. severe low blood sugar can cause loss of consciousness and seizures. symptoms of high blood sugar include increased thirst and increased urination. signs of high or low blood sugar in young children can be confusing but may include paleness and a sudden change in emotion. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,what are the symptoms of type  diabetes recently diagnosed?,['type 1 diabetes'],wmd

i can't really offer you a patient-specific answer over the internet since hormonal imbalance and nutritional intake resulting in weight gain can be a very complex issue. you do need to address this problem with your medical provider a nutritionist or a weight-control specialist (baritrician). you are eating more than you body needs. this is the only way (other than water retention) that a mammal (you) can put on large amounts of weight. we do not pull calories from the air. while it may not seem like you are eating more a calorie excess of only  calories a day could add a pound a week to your scale; a  calorie a day increase could at two pounds a week. the first step in getting some control is to do an honest and accurate food diary. write down everything you eat including the amounts/weight and their determine their caloric content. your doctor will likely need this information. it is important that you burn the calories that you take in. this may be something that you fail to do. you may speak with dr. schweiger a board certified dermatologist who can help you with an effective way to reduce unwanted body fats.,why do i keep gaining massive amounts of weight in a short period of time? . i weighed  most of my life. gained . in  months. i lost it in about a year and then kept it off for  years. in the past  months i have gained . my diet had not changed much. i eat a vegetable with every meal i do not eat much. the only difference was that i ate fried food/starchy food a little more often(not much of it). i did not eat enough to gain . i am  years old. i have ibs gerd. i know my hormones are out of whack but never finished testing. what is wrong?,"['weight', 'food', 'diet', 'hormone', 'meal']",wmd

there are three different types of nasal sprays used for allergy relief: corticosteroids antihistamines and decongestants. if you need relief you would work with your ob-gyn to make sure one of these medications is right for you especially the decongestants (the only group found over the counter). examples of corticosteroid nasal sprays include fluticasone (flonase) mometasone (nasonex) budesonide (rhinocort aqua) flunisolide (nasarel) triamcinolone (nasacort aq) and beclomethasone (beconase aq). side effects can include unpleasant smell or taste nasal irritation and nosebleeds. these medications are much less likely to cause any side effects than are oral corticosteroids. prescription antihistamine nasal sprays include azelastine (astelin astepro) and olopatadine (patanase). side effects of antihistamine nasal spray may include bitter taste dizziness drowsiness or fatigue dry mouth headache nasal burning nosebleed nausea runny nose sore throat and sneezing. examples of nasal decongestant sprays include phenylephrine (neo-synephrine others) and oxymetazoline (afrin others). nasal decongestants can cause dryness burning or stinging inside the nose runny nose and sneezing. taking too much of a nasal decongestant can cause irritability fast or irregular heartbeat dizziness insomnia headaches anxiety tremors and increased blood pressure. don't use a decongestant nasal spray for more than a week or so or you may develop severe congestion as soon as you stop taking it (rebound congestion).,can a nursing mother safely take any otc nasal allergy medication?,['over the counter'],wmd

hi cant find any info why but did find this on medhelp see if you think it helps you. i just wanted to explain how the copper t works for those of you that do not know. i found out of this out by doing my own research through several different places because usually a dr will not explain everything to you or they do not explain in a way you can understand. first off there is a reason it is called a copper t. the iud is made of copper and shaped like a t. the reason is made of copper is because copper actually kills sperm. the fluids inside your body kill a lot of sperm the moment it is introduced the copper helps to kill the rest. it is shaped like a t because the top part of the is attached to your uterus where an egg would typically attach itself. that way even if your fluid and the copper didn't kill all the sperm and an egg did get fertalized it usually will not attach to the uterine wall. it is possible for the egg to attach to another part of the uterine wall but is unlikely and usually when this happens there is a miscarrage (miscarriage) becuase the fetus cannot receive what is need through it's location. this all contributes to why it is more likely to have an eptopic pregnancy while you have an iud. if the egg cannot attach to the uterine wall sometimes it will attach to the folopian tube (eptopic pregnancy). this can be very dangerous and needs to be taken care of right away. although an eptopic pregnancy is more likely with women that have an iud that doesn't mean it's going to happen. the copper t along with your body kills almost of the sperm and in most women even if an egg does get fertalized if it cannot attach to the right spot on uterine wall usually it is simply discharged when you get your period. i know it can still be scary even though i have all this information i'm still scared when i am late but the less you stress about it the quicker you will get your period if you truly are not pregnant. hope it helps in some way. good luck,could i be pregnant. i have been on paragaurd for  years. i recently change the way i eat with no meat and it's been a month and now my period hasn't came. i am not irregular in my periods. i want to kno why it hasn't came? i even had symptoms of being on my period and still no blood.,"['pregnancy', 'meat', 'period', 'irregularity']",wmd

pain associated with migraines is a very individualized symptom. it isn't a symptom that a health care professional can visually see to measure the intensity. we rely on the patient to give specifics on the tolerability and type of pain so we can better identify the type of medication that will work specifically for your type of pain and the location of the pain. without knowing more about your pain i would not be able to tell you which medication is better. i can inform you a bit more about the details of each medication. one common ingredient in all three of these products is acetaminophen which functions to increase the effects of the primary pain reliever. in addition to acetaminophen darvocet contains propoxephene. tylenol no.  contains codeine. lortab contains hydrocodone. these medications are the primary pain relievers. they also cause drowsiness. while analgesics (acetaminophen) nsaids and narcotics relieve pain they don't address the underlying physiology of the migraine which is primarily the dilation of blood vessels in the brain causing pressure on nerves in such a tight closure of an area. two classes of migraine drugs that can aid with the dilation of blood vessels in the brain are ergotamines and triptans.,what will work better for migraine relief: darvocet-n  tylenol with codeine no.  or lortab?,['acetaminophen'],wmd

to brighten your skin first you have to understand what made it darker to begin with. typically that's something called inflammation. that inflammation can be from something that irritated your skin like a product you used that your skin didn't like and that caused a reaction that made it red and then the red can heal towards brown before it fades away or from a pimple or acne or rosacea or it can be from sun exposure where your skin makes a tan. even people with skin of color can still make a tan and what that often looks like is skin that's more blotchy or uneven. if you are taking an oral contraceptive pill and go in the sun that can cause a blotchy uneven skin tone called melasma. so we use brightening creams to help lighten this. the gold standard brightening cream is a product or an ingredient called hydroquinone and this i prefer to be given by the dermatologist because we like to have control over the concentration of the product that's used and how long it's used for. hydroquinones can also be combined with over-the-counter ingredients that work really well like sepiwhite liquorice extract or mulberry root extract and that combined with antioxidants like niacinamide. and green tea or grape tea extracts or grape seed extracts or things like caffeine can also have an added benefit to your skin in helping even out the skin tone without bleaching your skin. that's the word i don't like using. these are brighteners and not bleaches.,what's the best skin lightening cream; i am darker skinned?,['skin'],wmd

you get chlamydia from having sex with someone that has chlamydia. either in their genital tract mouth or anus. either one of those tests are wrong (not likely) or someone is not telling the truth. chlamydia does not just magically develop from risky sexual activity. having unprotected anal sex and then having unprotected vaginal sex is risky for infection since the rectal area is laden with intestinal bacteria. germs that are not welcome in the vagina. if you know in your heart that you have not had sexual activity with someone else then need i say more?,can you get chlamydia from anal sex then vaginal sex? . ? i have been with my partner for almost  year he was my first and i was his first. when we first became sexually active we both got tested and everything came out fine. we recently went to get tested again and i came out positive with chlamydia and he didn't. we do have unprotected anal sex and switch to vaginal sex. so my question is if he doesn't have it and i've never cheated could i have gotten it from having continuous unprotected anal sex?,"['chlamydia', 'anus', 'vagina']",wmd

i know it's hard to justify when you get a new medication and it's expensive. but this medication might be the right medication and in the long run might actually save you money. this is a once-a-day medication it's used for depression. and if it helps you and it makes you feel better then that's a good price to pay. when you don't feel well with depression and you don't take these types of medications and you take some that have to be taken more frequently or might have more side-effects you forget to take them. therefore if there is a price on your quality of life and then also you are going to see the doctor more often which means that your overall healthcare costs are actually going up. so there are patient assistance programs available through the manufacturers patients may want to look into that as helping offset the cost of that medication. at the end of the day it might be the right fit.,my doctor has given me a really expensive medication pristiq. are there any ways to reduce those costs?,['drug'],wmd

is a yawn always linked to exhaustion fatigue or the need for sleep? actually no. yawing can be connected to any number of conditions and even emotions including stress boredom lack of stimulation (which can be code for boredom) and being overworked (another code for tiredness). i have no idea why yawning can be so contagious — watching someone yawn (or for that matter just hearing someone yawn or even thinking of yawning) can trigger you to yawn as well. . strangely we dont actually know why we yawn. just as sleep remains much a mystery so does this universal human behavior. and actually most animals yawn. a single yawning shark can set off a yawn reaction in the entire school. a few theories exist though to explain human yawning: do increased amounts of carbon dioxide in the blood induce yawning to bring in oxygen? this theory has been around since hippocrates but studies have since shown it to be either incorrect or flawed. why? because yawning may in fact reduce oxygen intake compared to normal respiration (breathing) not increase it. is yawning the bodys way of controlling brain temperature? this theory suggests that yawning cools off the brain much like a fan cools the insides of a computer. reptiles for instance might yawn to maintain their body temperature. since most reptiles rely on ambient temperature to maintain body temperature yawning might be a means for promoting rapid cooling down. this may also work for animals that dont sweat. pigs and dogs may yawn because they dont sweat. exposing the mouth and tonsils to the outside air may cool down the head even if only by a few tenths of a degree. does yawning satisfy the need to stretch your muscles? is a yawn associated with nervousness? do yawns help you to stay alert? some studies have suggested that yawning — especially contagious yawning — may have developed as a way of keeping a group of animals alert. anecdotal evidence suggests that yawning helps increase the state of alertness of a person. paratroopers for instance have been noted to yawn in the moments before they exit the aircraft. is yawning a sign of dominance? observation of dog and primate behavior has shown that alpha males and alpha females tend to yawn more frequently than do their beta counterparts. yawning may actually be considered aggressive in certain species since it is a chance to display lots of pointy teeth! none of these theories has been definitely proven and these are just the tip of the theoretical iceberg. though some scientists are now claiming that yawning is a sign of sexual attraction rather than a desire to sleep im not so sure. we may never know exactly why we yawn or why dogs monkeys and all other vertebrates — with the inexplicable exception of the giraffe — do it either. perhaps giraffes do yawn and we just havent (or cant! ) observe it. and perhaps humans yawn for different reasons at different times. a combination of events might trigger a yawn. .,why do we yawn?,[],wmd

if you have chronic high blood pressure (hypertension) you can lower your blood pressure before pregnancy by exercising eating a diet low in sodium and rich in fruits and vegetables and staying at a healthy weight. lowering your blood pressure reduces your risk of preeclampsia. when you are pregnant regular checkups are key to early detection and treatment. prompt treatment is vital to preventing the development of severe and possibly life-threatening preeclampsia. recent preeclampsia research suggests that calcium supplements and low-dose aspirin offer a preventive benefit especially for high-risk women. calcium supplements may reduce the risk of developing preeclampsia and the risk of having a low-birth-weight baby particularly among high-risk women who normally don't get enough calcium.  taking a calcium supplement may also lower the risk of moving from mild to severe preeclampsia.  other experts have found that there is no benefit from taking calcium.  but all pregnant women can generally benefit from taking the u. s. food and drug administration's recommended daily allowance of of calcium each day to keep their bones healthy. low-dose aspirin (antiplatelet) therapy may be a moderately effective preventive treatment for women at risk of developing preeclampsia. although some experts question how effective low-dose aspirin is others assert that high-risk women who take it regularly as directed do significantly lower their preeclampsia risk.  talk to your doctor or nurse- midwife about whether this treatment is right for you. research shows that taking vitamin c or vitamin e supplements does not help prevent preeclampsia.   webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,how can preeclampsia and high blood pressure during pregnancy be prevented?,"['high blood pressure', 'preeclampsia', 'pregnancy']",wmd

ah what a great question. i think i have a great answer! when you have medications in your house you can't guarantee that they are stored in the correct conditions (i bet many folks still keep everything in their bathroom cabinet). medications in the home get exposed to heat cold moisture light etc. unlike when they are stored in a pharmacy in their original container. this can lead to the breaking down of the medication which could cause the medication to not work as well or you can have an actual reaction to the components of the medication breaking down (so to answer your question it is not safe). if you notice on your prescription bottles it should have an expiration date from  year from the date you got the medication filled. this is to protect you from the possible scenarios i described above. it's always better to be safe than sorry.,i know most medications have an expiration date but what does that actually mean?,[],wmd

most helpful answer many people have exercise induced or cold induced asthma. basically if you exercise in the cold (running basketball etc) your lung airways start to contract making them smaller and therefore making it harder to breathe. this may occur due to chemicals called catecholamines that are release when a person exercises. it usually happens - minutes after starting and goes away about / hour to  hours after finishing. a good way to prevent this is to take albuterol  minutes before exercising. for you it is important to see the doctor to help diagnose and treat this. if it is exercise/cold induced asthma the treatment should really help.,my throat feels icey-cold after some excercises & then for a few days i wheeze & air feels cold in my throat. i am  male and eat fairly well. excercise that causes this include running basketball and pugil jousting. swimming doesn't bother me even if i swim all day. this has happened for a few years. initial coldness can be rather painful & i can feel it if i touch my neck with my hand. residual coldness tends not to be painful and can't be felt by hand. it lasts anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks. temp's under about ^f make it more likely. . i plan to see a doctor on break (college student).,[],wmd
"a urinary tract infection (uti ) is a bacterial infection so an antibiotic is an effective treatment. penicillin specifically may be used to treat a uti but the choice of medication sometimes is based on the specific bacteria causing the infection. it's important not to try to self-diagnose a uti. only a urine sample can confirm the presence of bacteria. many of the symptoms of uti such as pain or burning with urination (peeing) can be caused by other things. that's why it's important to see a health care provider for an examination if you think you may have a urinary tract infection. it's also important never to self-treat conditions like this. never use ""leftover"" antibiotics (you should never have any leftover antibiotics; it's extremely important to take every pill in the bottle whenever an antibiotic is prescribed) to treat a cold flu or any other problem such as when you think you might have a uti. misuse of antibiotics in this way can lead to the development of ""superbugs"" that are resistant to treatment. if you think you have a uti i urge you to see a health care provider for a simple urine test. that way you'll be on the right path toward treatment. best to you!",will penicelin cure an uti?,['penicillin'],wmd

running will burn more calories than the elliptical although it's pretty close (about  calories per hour difference). some of the difference is due to the pounding of running and the fact that you propel your body through the air so that both feet are off the ground simultaneously. this kind of movement takes lots of energy. both the elliptical and running burn substantially more calories than the bike at the same level of perceived exertion (about - calories per hour more). in a classic study comparing energy expenditure of exercise machines the order of calories burned from highest to lowest is posted below. (the elliptical was not studied in this research but it would fit between rowing and cross-country skiing. it should be noted that rowing the elliptical and cross-country skiing are all very close in calorie expenditure with probably not more than - calories per hour difference among them. ) treadmill walking/running stair stepping rowing cross-country skiing biking (stationary) now this is not to say that exercises that burn the fewest calories are all bad. to the contrary you can get a great workout and burn lots of calories doing any of them. you'd be hard pressed to say that lance armstrong isn't fit. he's one of the fittest human beings alive and he did it by biking. the point is that if you work hard enough on any of the exercise machines and you work up a sweat and you get your heart rate into your training zone then your heart lungs and muscles aren't going to know the difference. bottom line is that you'll get fit and healthy using any of the machines if you use them consistently and with sufficient intensity. one final note: there is error in estimating energy expenditure on most if not all exercise machines. in some cases it can be as high as  percent (the machine overestimates how many calories you burn). there are simply too many variables for the machine to give you an accurate number and so you need to keep that in mind during weight-loss efforts if you are calculating how many calories to eat based on your energy expenditure. the answer depends on many different things since your weight the type of exercise how intense you are doing each exercise and how long you do each exercise will all influence how many calories you burn. simply put however i would say that you have the potential to burn the most calories by running followed by biking and lastly by using the elliptical. one way to measure how many calories you burn during exercise is to look at metabolic equivalents (mets). mets are a way to measure and gauge the amount of energy you burn during physical activity with  met being equal to the energy you burn simply being at rest. for instance running at a  minute mile pace is roughly the equivalent of  mets or ten times the calories you burn at rest. unfortunately there really is no good answer for how many mets you burn while using an elliptical. a study entitled  compendium of physical activities: a second update of codes and met values only lists using an elliptical at a moderate intensity which was the equivalent of  mets. for comparison bicycling with a moderate effort (-. ) is  mets. you can find a comprehensive list of mets by doing an internet search for compendium of physical activities tracking guide. websites utilizing a formula involving these met values for each type of exercise along with your weight and the duration can help to estimate how many calories you will burn during exercise. keep in mind that these are just based off of averages but one such site is: <link>. play around with the types of activities and the duration of the activity to see what can provide you with the most calories burned.,does using an elliptical machine at the gym burn more calories than running on the street or bike riding?,"['burn', 'running', 'calorie']",wmd

"high blood pressure or hypertension means high pressure (tension) in the arteries. arteries are vessels that carry blood from the pumping heart to all the tissues and organs of the body. high blood pressure does not mean excessive emotional tension although emotional tension and stress can temporarily increase blood pressure. normal blood pressure is below /; blood pressure between / and / is called ""pre-hypertension"" and a blood pressure of / or above is considered high. the top number which is the systolic blood pressure corresponds to the pressure in the arteries as the heart contracts and pumps blood into the arteries. the bottom number the diastolic pressure represents the pressure in the arteries as the heart relaxes after the contraction. the diastolic pressure reflects the lowest pressure to which the arteries are exposed. an elevation of the systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure increases the risk of developing heart (cardiac) disease kidney (renal) disease hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis or arteriosclerosis) eye damage and stroke (brain damage). these complications of hypertension are often referred to as end-organ damage because damage to these organs is the end result of chronic (long duration) high blood pressure. for that reason the diagnosis of high blood pressure is important so efforts can be made to normalize blood pressure and prevent complications. it was previously thought that rises in diastolic blood pressure were a more important risk factor than systolic elevations but it is now known that in people  years and older systolic hypertension represents a greater risk. affecting approximately one in four adults in the united states hypertension is clearly a major public health problem.",what is high blood pressure?,['high blood pressure'],wmd

rosacea is a very interesting condition. we sometimes also call it adult acne but it's really two different things. so the thing about rosacea is that you do have some control. there are environmental stimuli that can trigger rosacea. so it's important to know what can turn it on and then we can figure out how to turn it off as well. triggers for rosacea tend to be extremes in temperature. so if you go from a very hot environment to a very cold environment or vice versa that can be an extreme trigger for rosacea. probably the biggest trigger for rosacea is alcohol and it can be any type of alcohol but some people notice it more with red wine. also stress can be a very big trigger for rosacea. so you have to manage your stress. obviously we can't live without stress because life would be no fun at all but you have to be able to moderate your stress so that you can handle it better and so it won't show in your skin. once you have that under control as much as possible then you can look for products that are fragrance free and dye free because anything that irritates your skin can also bring out rosacea. so that will be a great starting point. if that alone doesn't help then you might have to go to prescription type products that can help. i like retinoids for treatment of rosacea but you have to do it very gently. topical metronidazole in a prescription form can also be very helpful and salt-based medicines can be very helpful. one other trigger for rosacea can be spicy foods. then some people have their own personal triggers. some people will say chocolate is a trigger or vinegar or some vegetables. so you have to sort of know your own personal triggers as well and try to avoid them. hello you did not say if you we're a man or woman but i have rosacea and i have found that murad products have helped me a great deal. i rarely ever have a breakout now unless i am in the sun a lot. the murad that i use is essential-c day moisturizer broad spectrum /pa +++ orange lettering. second i use murad invisiblur perfecting shield broad spectrum spf  pa +++ this is purple lettering. i do not need any of the other products so i do not use them as they are very expensive. also after using the inviiblur perfecting shield i found that i no longer need any makeup or powder on my face other then lipstick and eye liner. good luck.,i have rosacea. my skin is too sensitive to use a lot of products. how do i pick ones that won't irritate my skin?,"['rosacea', 'skin']",wmd

no yeast infections are not contagious in the way a cold or the flu is. yeast infections are caused by a fungus (more specifically a yeast) called candida. candida is a commensal organism meaning that under healthy conditions it lives harmlessly in our bodies. we all have candida living on our skin and in our intestines and healthy women carry candida in their vaginas. when the bodys defenses are in balance candida is not noticeable or bothersome. however certain conditions can give candida the opportunity to grow excessively: a low-functioning immune system. use of topical or oral corticosteroids such as prednisone (often for asthma or autoimmune conditions). damage to the mucous membranes (the skin lining the mouth vagina and gi tract). antibiotic use. in these situations candida can grow on the skin or in the lining of the mouth gi tract or vagina. the fungus creates a white patch or plaque across the mucous membranes. in the mouth visible candida infection is called thrush. in the vagina its a yeast infection. in people with weakened immune systems candida can grow almost anywhere in the body. because candida is normally present in all our bodies someone with thrush cant exactly pass it to someone else -- that person already has candida. to develop thrush a yeast infection or another candida infection that person may have one or more of the above risk factors or conditions.,are yeast infections contagious?,['yeast infection'],wmd

there are many many causes for a rash but when one shows up in school teachers assume the worst. they are worried about measles chicken pox lyme disease scarlet fever fifth disease impetigo herpes simplex/zoster hand/foot/mouth disease mrsa or roseola just to name a few. it is this fear of imminent contagiousness that leads to the childs exclusion from school. sometimes the skin eruption is due to allergies such as hives or just a worsening dry-skin condition like eczema (atopic dermatitis). even a cold virus (whether its in a cold thats at the contagious stage or not) can cause a rash. fortunately for all of us most rashes that children get are not serious or contagious. i have seen children excluded for insect bites hives sunburns poison oak/ivy eczema and even zits. teachers are not dermatologists so they are not going to make the diagnosis. the school is just going to exclude the child and require a clearance note before the child can return. i had a child excluded this week with poison oak. poison oak is not contagious but at least half of the people i encounter think that it is. the oleoresin of the rhus plant is definitely contagious but once this oil has been washed off of the contaminated skin clothing and other objects it can no longer cause trouble. when people see this ugly rash oozing they assume the drainage is the poison.  this is not true. once the person takes a good shower and changes their clothes they do not need to be treated like they have leprosy. high school wrestlers tend to get a variety of skin infections from those contaminated mats. i see common warts molluscum (another wart-like skin lesion) impetigo (a staph or strep skin infection) and more recently mrsa (a potentially serious drug-resistant staph infection). of course the wrestlers are also excluded from participation because of eczema mosquito bites and other non-contagious skin issues. referees and coaches are getting better in recognizing skin problems i must say. its not measles.  i must say this statement a dozen times a week contradicting home diagnoses made by day-care providers and grandmothers. measles is relatively rare in the united states now. personally i have not seen a case in over  years thanks to the effectiveness of vaccinations. a few hundred to a few thousand cases still occur in the u. s. depending on the year in unvaccinated individuals. mosquito and flea bites can mimic early chicken pox lesions but only for a short while. chicken pox (varicella) looks like a dew drop sitting on a rose petal.  it is a tiny blister on a red base which turns into a scab followed by a tiny crater (pox) in a day or so. although varicella-immunized children can get a mild case it really does look different than mosquito bites. chicken pox is caused by the herpes virus so re-exposure to this disease later in life can cause a reactivation of the virus resulting in herpes zoster also known as shingles. warts are contagious but not very much. to exclude a child from school because of warts is really unnecessary. it can take a month or more to effectively treat a case of stubborn warts freezing them with liquid nitrogen or chemically burning them with various acids. high school wrestlers with warts can wrestle as long as they are covered by clothing or a bandage but many are excluded from participation by an eagle-eyed referee.,what can cause a skin rash?,"['skin', 'rash']",wmd

i imagine you are talking about a condition called pneumothorax. the lung isn't literally exploding but a hole forms in the lung and in the lining of the lung. air can then escape out into the area surrounding the lung. the problem is this air outside the lungs puts pressure on the lungs. the lungs then can't expand and fill with oxygen. that can make getting enough oxygen in the body very difficult. when people are on a ventilator the machine is pushing air into the lungs so the chance of this happening is always higher. that's because of the pressure that can build up in the lungs. while the respiratory therapist and the doctors adjust the machine to keep the pressures down as much as possible this can still happen. the longer someone is on a ventilator the more likely problems such as this are likely to occur.,why would a person's lungs explode. my brother was on a ventilator and for  weeks he recently had trac surgery.  after surgery his lungs exploded. how can that happen?,"['lung', 'surgery']",wmd

most healthy children teens and adults with chickenpox (varicella) need only home treatment. but all teens and adults with chickenpox need to see a doctor. call first to make an appointment and to discuss whether you need to take any steps to avoid spreading the virus when you arrive. for example office staff may take you straight to an exam room rather than have you wait in the lobby. if you have chickenpox you do not need to stay in bed but you should stay quiet and rest. you can take oral over-the-counter medicines to treat symptoms such as fever and itching. before giving medicine to your sick child check with your child's doctor. because of their small size children are more sensitive than adults to the effects of some medicines. use a measuring spoon or medicine cup to give liquid medicine to a child; do not guess the amount or use a regular table spoon. reduce itching the chickenpox rash itches. scratching the blisters may cause a skin infection or scars to form after the blisters heal. you can take steps at home to control itching such as taking oatmeal baths applying cool compresses and taking antihistamines by mouth. check with your child's doctor before giving your child antihistamines. monitor fever fever is your body's normal response to infection. a higher-than-normal temperature kills bacteria and viruses that cause illness. medicines that reduce fever stop this natural process so they should be used only as needed. if a child with chickenpox does not act sick or complain of symptoms you may choose not to give medicine for fever. call your health professional if your child's fever lasts longer than  hours. you can help reduce a fever by using nonprescription medications and drinking cool liquids. if you are not sure about the amount of medicine to give your child talk to your doctor or pharmacist. ( do not give aspirin to people younger than  because of the risk of reye syndrome ). prevent the spread of infection chickenpox can spread easily from one person to another. if you have frequent and close contact with a person infected with chickenpox such as a family member you may be exposed to a large amount of the virus. as a result you may develop a more severe illness than the person who spread it. you also may be at greater risk for complications from the illness especially if you have an impaired immune system. to prevent the spread of chickenpox you or your child should stay home from work or school when ill. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,what can i do to treat chickenpox varicella at home?,['chickenpox'],wmd

this is a difficult question to answer. compounding used to be more popular than it is now. pharmacists were trained to compound in school and any nearly pharmacist could prepare medication for you in this way. now many pharmacy schools have compounding training available but do not require the course. a compounded medication is a product that a pharmacist makes on an individual basis because it is not commercially provided. pharmacists need to make sure the ingredients can remain stable in the mixture and that they will provide proper treatment for the patients condition. recipes for compounds are not standard so sometimes the pharmacist has to conduct research to obtain a recipe for the compounded medication that your physician has prescribed. many chain pharmacies do not have pharmacist that are trained to compound. if you need a compounded prescription they should be able to direct you to another pharmacy to suit your need there are community pharmacies available that specialize in compounding. but you want to do some research. check with your local childrens hospital to see if they have an outpatient pharmacy that will fill your prescription. if they do not see if they can recommend a local pharmacy that is able to compound the medication for you.,is every pharmacy able to compound medications for my child?,['drug'],wmd

the treatment of paget's disease is directed toward controlling the disease activity and managing its complications. when paget's disease causes no symptoms and blood testing shows that the level of serum alkaline phosphatase is normal or minimally elevated no treatment may be necessary. bone pain can require anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) or pain-relieving medications. bone deformity can require supports such as heel lifts or specialized footwear. surgical operations may be necessary for damaged joints fractures severely deformed bones or when nerves are being pinched by enlarged bone. prior to undergoing an operation on bone affected by paget's disease it is helpful to be treated with medications such as bisphosphonates or calcitonin (miacalcin) as this tends to diminish the risk of surgical complications including bleeding. the medical treatment of the bone of paget's disease involves either medications called bisphosphonates or injectable calcitonin. these drugs are also used to treat certain patients with osteoporosis. bisphosphonates are the mainstay of treatment. there are a number of these available that are taken by mouth including alendronate (fosamax) risedronate (actonel) etidronate (didronel) and tiludronate (skelid) and that are administered intravenously including pamidronate (aredia) and zoledronate (reclast). in general oral bisphosphonates are taken first thing in the morning on an empty stomach with  ounces of water. they can cause irritation of the stomach and esophagus. intravenous bisphosphonates can cause temporary muscle and joint pain but are not associated with irritation of the stomach or esophagus.,how is paget's disease treated?,"[""paget's disease""]",wmd

medicines are sometimes used to help relieve bothersome moderate to severe urination problems caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph). if you stop using medicine the symptoms will usually return. the american urological association (aua) symptom index is an interactive questionnaire that can help you determine how bad your urinary symptoms are and check how well your treatment is working. but the most important factor in deciding whether to use medicines is not your aua score but how much the symptoms bother you and affect your quality of life. a high score on the aua does not necessarily mean you need medicines. the side effects of the most commonly used medicines are generally minor and they stop when you stop taking the medicine. medication choices alpha-blockers including doxazosin ( cardura ) and terazosin ( hytrin ) relieve symptoms within a few weeks but do not stop the process of prostate enlargement. -alpha reductase inhibitors such as dutasteride ( avodart ) or finasteride ( proscar ) may reduce the size of an enlarged prostate but may take  months or more to show any effect on symptoms. using a combination of an alpha-blocker with a -alpha reductase inhibitor may help your symptoms more than either medicine alone.   what to think about alpha-blockers and -alpha reductase inhibitors affect different prostate tissues. how much your symptoms improve may depend on which tissue is contributing most to your symptoms. none of these medicines will work for everyone. alpha-blockers may help symptoms caused by a blockage at the opening to the bladder. with this type of obstruction you may have difficulty starting urination and have a weak urine stream. alpha-blockers relax the smooth muscle tissue in the prostate and the opening to the bladder. this muscle tissue must relax to allow urine to flow. -alpha reductase inhibitors can reduce the size of your prostate and can slow the rate of enlargement. men with smaller prostates see less benefit than those with larger prostates. men who have only slightly enlarged prostates usually find alpha-blockers more helpful. -alpha reductase inhibitors may cause you to have less desire to have sex (decreased libido). webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,what medications and treatments are available to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia bph?,"['benign prostatic hyperplasia', 'drug']",wmd

i dont recommend waking babies for nighttime feedings because you want them to sleep. however i would suggest you wake them for night feedings in their first couple of weeks if they havent yet gained back their birth weight; babies tend to lose % of their weight after theyre born. also if theyre sleeping more in the day than the night i do suggest waking them so they dont go more than four hours without eating. overall i suggest not waking babies at night so they can find their own sleep schedule. and you generally dont have to wake them in the day either because most will wake on their own. if you notice that the baby is sleeping for longer stretches during the day then i would start waking them in the day so they dont get night and day mixed up.,should i wake my baby for feedings?,['baby'],wmd

your question is an important one for women with epilepsy who wish to have a family. there is little scientific information on this subject and most of what we know if based on clinical experience of doctors taking care of women with epilepsy. the bottom line is that most physicians with expertise in managing epilepsy encourage their patients to breastfeed even if they are taking anti-seizure medicine. the baby has developed for nine months in the presence of the anti-seizure medicine and as such for the baby to continue to be exposed to it after delivery usually does not create problems. i am unaware of any descriptions of problems with breastfeeding while on trileptal (oxcarbazepine). if blood levels are done in mom and her baby while breastfeeding the baby's level will be around half of the mother's. so the baby is definitely getting some of the drug but it usually does not create problems as best we  tell. so if breastfeeding is important to you (as it is for most women) most experts in the field would encourage you to breastfeed.,i have epilepsy and take trileptal. will it be safe to breastfeed my new baby?,"['epilepsy', 'baby', 'breastfeed']",wmd

to answer your question directly i would not take more than the maximum daily recommended dose of any product containing acetaminophen for more than several days. acetaminophen should be taken with caution especially by individuals who may drink alcohol or have any medical condition of the liver. treatment of a fever is directed at the cause of the infection. acetaminophen may be taken to reduce fevers of . degrees or less. a fever that is at least  degrees or last longer than  days should be evaluated by a medical professional s you have done. also it is helpful to keep in mind that the bodys temperature tends to rise during the evening and night hours. consuming plenty of fluids is also helpful in controlling the negative feelings associated with having a fever. typically a fever is a symptom of some underlying illness. a likely suspect may be a viral infection. was a diagnosis made for your condition? not all antibiotics are effective for all infections. antibiotic treatment must be tailored to the specific infection that it is intended to treat. besides congestion and fever your doctor most likely considered other symptoms before prescribing the antibiotic. it is reasonable to have seen some improvement in your overall medical condition within a few days of starting the antibiotic treatment. since this has not happened for you i recommend that you contact your doctor and notify them of your response to the acetaminophen and antibiotic treatment and stay well hydrated. a visit to the local hospital emergency room may be justified if you cannot reach your doctor or your condition worsens.,how long should i continue taking acetaminophen if fever doesn't go down? . took expectorant that contained acetaminophen for severe congestion (no fever) for  / days. third day i missed a dose and by evening had fever of . was prescribed antibiotic and am continuing expectorant. it's been  days temp. anywhere from .  to . . is it normal for a fever to persist this long?,"['acetaminophen', 'fever', 'antibiotic']",wmd

in my opinion. no. there could be a link between chlorophyll usage and hair loss / fertility issues. but the bottom line is that there is no scientific evidence through verifable studies proving that chlorophyll will cause hair growth or impact conception odds. with that said chlorophyll seems to have many possible beneficial properties. it may be a worthwhile time investment to discuss chlorophyll usage with your physician before its purchase and consumption. chlorophyll is found in green leafy vegetables and may be located in liquid form throughout health food stores. many natural medicine proponents claim that chlorophyll is a detox agent effective in heart health and protects against cancer. other claims include improvements in digestion bad breath body odor and gas conditions. specifically mentioned as effective in hormonal balancing according to the encyclopedia of natural medicine women taking chlorophyll experienced correction in conditions such as delayed menstruation and p. m. s. additionally menopause symptoms such as dry skin irritability depression and hair loss also showed improvement. in summary its worth some additional research and talking with your doctor about chlorophyll claims. although there is no scientific evidence of chlorophyll causing hair growth or stimulating conception some natural medicine experts cite menstruation improvement and a reduction of hair loss.,does chlorophyl help hair loss and fertility,"['hair loss', 'fertility']",wmd
first off congratulations on your weight loss! i think you have a couple of choices right now. you can focus on maintaining your weight with healthy habits instead of losing as you deal with your back issues and surgery. in order to lose weight you will need to lower the calories you take in to make up for the lack of activity. it's best to do this with professional help such as a registered dietitian or through a medically supervised program. i don't know how much weight you have to lose the calories you've been taking in or the state of your health which are all factors to take under consideration. i think the first choice makes the most sense because lowering your calories without exercise can slow down your metabolism. you can also see a physical therapist to get ideas for exercises you can do. i encourage you not to go back to old eating habits and use this as an opportunity to live a healthy lifestyle without focusing on weight. you may be tempted to eat because of your situation but if you can maintain your weight and learn how to deal with stress in a healthy way that is true success. and just because you are not losing weight now doesn't mean you won't be able to in the future. good luck!,lost  since / injured my back and had surgery in / and probably again in /. how do i keep the weight off? . started nutrisystem /. . had my gallbladder removed /. . quit smoking on /. . / i got a shooting pain down my legs and soon after went numb between my legs. i had emergency surgery and am still in a lot of pain. might need a spinal fusion but insurance is fighting it. . how can i continue to lose weight when i am unable to exercise. i tried to do all of the right things to get healthy and am having no luck. any suggestions? . thanks . carrie,"['surgery', 'weight', 'insurance', 'exercise', 'quit smoking']",wmd

well this is an interesting question. i'm not sure there's a straightforward answer because i'm not sure anyone has studied this. here's what we know: smoking around infants and children can cause them to inhale second-hand smoke which may be linked to higher rates of certain lung problems like asthma. we also know second-hand smoke contains harmful chemicals and that this smoke (containing chemicals) can settle on surfaces such as clothing draperies countertops and so on. will coming in contact with this potentially toxic material on someone's shirt (or fingertips) cause problems for your baby? my guess (and it's strictly a guess! ) is probably not. if this were the case the entire baby boomer generation would probably exhibit symptoms because nearly all of our relatives smoked and held babies at the same time. you can reduce any possible risk by gently wiping off your baby with a damp cloth after he or she has been cuddled by someone you believe has tobacco smoke residue on their clothing or hands. you probably don't need to be overly aggressive about this. don't scrub the little one's skin off. but a simple swipe should do the trick. hope this helps!,can cigarettes smoke stain clothing and/or skin with chemicals or toxins harmful to a newborn baby? . i am wondering if anyone who smokes and then holds or is around my newborn can cause any harm from anything on their clothing or skin.,"['skin', 'newborn', 'baby', 'smoking']",wmd
for effective elimination of head lice the infested individual family members that are also infested and the home must all be treated. treatment of the individual and the infected family members over-the-counter (otc) or prescription medications are used to treat the affected people and their families. follow these treatment steps: remove all clothing. apply lice medicine also called pediculicide according to the label instructions. if your child has extra long hair you may need to use a second bottle. warning: do not use a cream rinse or combination shampoo/conditioner before using lice medicine. do not re-wash hair for one to two days after treatment. have the infested person put on clean clothing after treatment. if some live lice are still found eight to  hours after treatment but are moving more slowly than before do not retreat. comb dead and remaining live lice out of the hair. the medicine sometimes takes longer to kill the lice. if eight to  hours after treatment no dead lice are found and lice seem as active as before the medicine may not be working. see your health-care provider for a different medication and follow their treatment instructions. nit (head lice egg) combs often found in lice medicine packages should be used to remove nits and lice from the hair shaft. many flea combs made for cats and dogs are also effective. after the initial treatment check comb and remove nits and lice from hair every two to three days. re-treat in seven to  days. check all treated people for two to three weeks until you are sure all lice and nits are gone. treating the house: treating the whole house is a laborious but important task. follow these steps: machine wash all washable clothing and bed linens that the infested person touched during the two days before treatment (to kill the lice and nits). use the hot water cycle ( degrees f;  degrees c) to wash clothes. dry laundry using the hot cycle for at least  minutes. dry clean clothing that is not washable (coats hats scarves etc. ) or store all clothing stuffed animals comforters etc. that cannot be washed or dry cleaned into a plastic bag and seal it for two weeks. soak combs and brushes for one hour in rubbing alcohol lysol or wash with soap and hot ( degrees f;  degrees c) water and then place in bag and leave in freezer for two days. vacuum the floor and furniture. do not use fumigant sprays.

not everyone who suffers from schizophrenia hears voices. schizophrenia is a very complicated condition with many possible symptoms. these symptoms may be different from one person to another. symptoms can also change over time in the same person. people suffering from schizophrenia may have trouble separating what is real from what is not real. they may have trouble relating to other people. thinking clearly and dealing with emotions may be very hard for them. all of this makes it very difficult for someone with schizophrenia to function in the world. that being said many people with schizophrenia do hallucinate. and these hallucinations can affect any of the  senses. the most frequent type is auditory which includes hearing voices. many people with schizophrenia may also have visual hallucinations where they see things that are not there. but there are other symptoms besides hallucinations that can be seen with schizophrenia. a person may become withdrawn or suspicious. his speech may become rambling or incoherent. there may be issues with cleanliness and personal hygiene. other conditions besides schizophrenia can cause these symptoms. if you are concerned about your behavior or that of a loved one talk to your doctor or mental health provider. there are treatments available for schizophrenia but the first step is to recognize it and get help. more information is available in the webmd schizophrenia health center.,is it possible to be schizophrenic and not hear voices frequently (or at all)?,['schizophrenia'],wmd

a couple of years have gone by since the center for science in the public interest first filed a complaint against the parent company (coca-cola) that manufactures glaceau vitamin water. and now the washington-based national consumers league has joined in by filing a formal complaint with the federal trade commission calling advertising and labeling claims on vitamin water products dangerously misleading.  as if the names of the various vitamin water flavors like revive  focus  or defense werent misleading enough health claims made in advertising have ranged from supporting optimal immune function to reducing the risk of age-related eye disease.  hopefully we all know that fortifying sugar water with various vitamins and minerals isnt really going to keep us from getting sick or reduce the risk of disease. the best thing we can do for most of these health concerns is to eat a healthful diet rich in whole foods and plant foods get plenty of rest and wash our hands frequently. for example vitamin waters focus drink features vitamin a and lutein  according to the label on the bottle. if you want some lutein one of the antioxidant-acting carotenoid phytochemicals that has been mentioned in research lately just eat some dark green leafy veggies green peppers corn avocados oranges tomatoes or parsley! and instead of drinking their defense drink with vitamin c and zinc just eat an orange broccoli (and other dark leafy green veggies) brussels sprouts berries kiwi cantaloupe papaya or mango for the vitamin c and some lean meats crab nuts and whole grains for zinc. heres what we do know about glaceau vitamin water: each -ounce bottle is labeled as containing .  servings crystalline fructose is the true main ingredient accounting for about  grams of sugar if you drink the whole bottle. each -ounce bottle totals  calories. the bottom line: keep your eyes open when it comes to manufactured products making health claims especially those fortified with nutrients. remember that the best water to drink is still good old  — not water pumped with  calories worth of sugar per eight-ounce serving.,what should i know about vitamin water?,['vitamin'],wmd

in general people with lupus should aim for a well-balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits vegetables and whole grains. it should also include moderate amounts of meats poultry and oily fish. lupus is an inflammatory disease. so its possible though not proven that foods that fight inflammation could help lupus symptoms. on the other hand foods that fuel inflammation could worsen them. foods with possible anti-inflammatory properties include fruits and vegetables which are rich in substances called antioxidants. in addition foods containing omega- fatty acids such as fish nuts ground flaxseed canola oil and olive oil may also help fight inflammation. saturated fats on the other hand can raise cholesterol levels and may contribute to inflammation. sources of saturated fats include fried foods commercial baked goods creamed soups and sauces red meat animal fat processed meat products and high-fat dairy foods. that includes whole milk half and half cheeses butter and ice cream. one food to avoid is alfalfa sprouts. alfalfa tablets have been associated with lupus flares or a lupus-like syndrome that includes muscle pain fatigue abnormal blood test results and kidney problems. these problems may be due to a reaction to an amino acid found in alfalfa sprouts and seeds. this amino acid can activate the immune system and increase inflammation in people with lupus. garlic may also stimulate the immune system.,are there any foods that can help ease lupus symptoms and reduce inflammation?,"['lupus', 'inflammation', 'food']",wmd

if you have ever traveled and experienced jet lag you know that you can feel that you are just not quite fully functioning (particularly when traveling east) when you arrive at your destination. a new study shows that this particular effect of jet lag may linger longer than we realize. researchers at the university of california at berkeley conducted an interesting experiment. they used an animal model in which they compared the performance and memory tasks of jet-lagged hamsters against a control group. the researchers learned that jet lag affects the part of the brain responsible for memory and learning: * it limits the growth of brain cells and reduces brain activity. * it leads to memory and learning problems. * even a month after recovering subjects were still suffering from its effects. lance kriegsfeld uc berkley associate professor of psychology and study author commented: what this says is that whether you are a flight attendant medical resident or rotating shift worker repeated disruption of circadian rhythms is likely going to have a long-term impact on your cognitive behavior and function.  i could not agree with him more. anyone who travels or works a rotating shift can experience jet lag and not even realize it. since this was an animal experiment we cant ask the participants if they noticed feeling any different or if they had any difficulty learning something new. even so this study sheds light on some astounding implications of jet lag for various professionals: * pilots learning new flight routes. * medical residents practicing new surgical techniques or recognizing unfamiliar states of diseases. * shift workers dealing with different job responsibilities rotations or assembly methods. jet lag could be the cause of many simple errors. i have written about jet lag before; jet lag is usually the result of crossing several time zones in a short period of time without allowing for your body to time to adjust for the changes in time. your body will typically adjust at the rate of one to two time zones per day; so if you cross six time zones your body will naturally make the adjustment to the time change in about three to five days. though shift workers may not physically cross over time zones their days and nights fluctuate according to their work schedule which throws off their biological clock. whether you are traveling across the country or picking up a holiday shift here are some simple things to help fight jet lag (keep your brain healthy): . time your flights. if you are only flying over two to three zones avoid the red eye flights as much as possible. remember jet lag is worse if you traveling east. . get outside and get some sunlight! light helps re-set your circadian rhythm and reduces the effects of jet lag. . adjust with exercise. exercise also helps re-set your biological clock. i would not suggest running a marathon but while you are outside getting sunlight consider taking a brisk walk. . avoid alcohol and caffeine. both will negatively affect your sleep cycle which will already be slightly off. . resist napping on the plane. you may need to fall asleep earlier than your body is used to at your new destination. being a little more tired could be helpful. . melatonin might not be the best answer; the studies on its effectiveness are mixed. . melatonin often comes in an overdose amount — were talking anything over  mg. its important to check with your doctor before taking this hormone. . consider a jet lag calculator app. these can help guide you through overcoming and preventing jet lag. virgin atlantic offers one i enjoy from mental workout.,how long does jet lag last?,['jet lag'],wmd
the strand you're referring to likely is a blood clot. in order to stop your nosebleed the body sends out a mixture of chemicals that cause the blood to clot. this clot can look like a sticky bloody strand. and yes it can feel like it's coming from your brain if you're pulling on a clot that's lodged up in one of your sinus cavities. i'd advise not pulling out the clots if possible because they are helping stop the nosebleed. nosebleeds can be caused by dry air overuse of decongestants forceful nose blowing and many other things. if your nosebleeds tend to occur during the winter dry air likely is the cause. you might try using a room humidifier or warm water vaporizer at night. you also may treat a nosebleed by placing a bit of moisturizing ointment such as plain ky jelly inside the nasal passage or by using an over-the-counter saline spray. i believe what you are referring to is a blood clot that forms during a nose bleed. i get this as well when i have a nose bleed. seems like to worst the nose bleed the bigger the blood clot. dave,"i get nosebleeds which sometimes end in taking out or swallow a strand of blood or something. why is it? . when i refer to as ""the strand"" is usually the thing that ends the nosebleed but isn't limited to just one. it comes out covered in blood but i do not know where it comes from though when i pull it out it feels kind of like it comes from my brain or something. there have been times where i pull out more than  simply because the bleeding wouldn't stop. please remember that it happens at the end of nosebleeds so it is not like i can just pull it out ike a booger or something.","['swallow', 'brain']",wmd

parkinson's disease is not by itself a fatal disease but it does get worse with time. the average life expectancy of a parkinson's disease patient is generally the same as for people who do not have the disease. however in the late stages of the disease parkinson's may cause complications such as choking pneumonia and falls that can lead to death. fortunately there are many treatment options available for people with parkinson's disease. the progression of symptoms in parkinson's disease may take  years or more. in some people however the disease progresses more quickly. there is no way to predict what course the disease will take for an individual person. one commonly used system for describing how the symptoms of parkinson's disease progress is called the hoehn and yahr scale. hoehn and yahr staging of parkinson's disease stage one symptoms on one side of the body only. stage two symptoms on both sides of the body. no impairment of balance. stage three balance impairment. mild to moderate disease. physically independent. stage four severe disability but still able to walk or stand unassisted. stage five wheelchair-bound or bedridden unless assisted. another commonly used scale is the unified parkinson's disease rating scale (updrs). this much more complicated scale has multiple ratings that measure mental functioning behavior and mood; activities of daily living; and motor function. both the hoehn and yahr scale and the updrs are used to measure how individuals are faring and how much treatments are helping them. with appropriate treatment most people with parkinson's disease can live productive lives for many years after diagnosis.,what is the prognosis for parkinson's disease?,"[""parkinson's disease""]",wmd

rosacea is a skin disorder that affects people above  years. other than acne like lesions people with rosacea have redness of face and dry skin associated with burning sensation. they also have redness and irritation in the eyes. the redness of the face is aggravated by triggering factors such as weather changes stress alcohol consumption exercise and spicy food. yours clinical condition is not rosacea since your history is contradicting with the above said information. you seem to have acne. the cysts are a part of acne. acne varies in severity from individual to individual. some may have mild acne which may come off and on. others may have almost incessant eruption of acne which may leave behind post acne hyperpigmentation and acne scars. for acne you need to be constantly taking care care of your skin until the tendency for new acne formation dies down. topical treatment of acne mainly revolves around topical antibacterials (clindamycin gel or nadifloxacin gel) benzoyl peroxide and topical retinoids. topical retinoids are comedolytic thereby preventing new acne. for inflammatory acne (papules and pustules) i advise to start with one of the oral antibiotics either azithromycin doxycycline or minocycline. cystic acne is an indication for starting oral retinoids. they are the most effective drugs for acne and are usually first choice in severe acne or cystic acne or moderately severe acne or acne not responding adequately to traditional anti-acne medications or acne significantly affecting the quality of life of patients regardless of severity. you could also take a few peeling sessions like salicylic acid peels from a dermatologist. salicylic acid peels are specific for acne. acne is a recurrent condition and once your acne is brought under good control with oral and topical anti-acne medicines you should still continue to use a cream/gel (topical retinoid) for maintenance of improvement. topical retinoids are ideal for maintenance of improvement because they are comedolytic as well as anti-inflammatory thereby preventing the formation of new acne. for further follow up consult a dermatologist online --> <link>,i am not sure if i have rosacea. please help.,['acne scars'],ic

atherosclerosis is a gradual process whereby hard cholesterol substances (plaques) are deposited in the walls of the arteries. cholesterol plaques cause hardening of the artery walls and narrowing of the inner channel (lumen) of the artery. the atherosclerosis process begins early in life (as early as teens in some people). when atherosclerosis is mild and the arteries are not substantially narrowed atherosclerosis causes no symptoms. therefore many adults are typically unaware that their arteries are gradually accumulating cholesterol plaques. but when atherosclerosis becomes advanced with aging it can cause critical narrowing of the arteries resulting in tissue ischemia (lack of blood and oxygen). arteries that are narrowed by advanced atherosclerosis can cause diseases in different organs. for example advanced atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries (arteries that supply heart muscles) can lead to angina and heart attacks. advanced atherosclerosis of the carotid and cerebral arteries (arteries that supply blood to the brain) can lead to strokes and transient ischemic attacks (tias). advanced atherosclerosis in the lower extremities can lead to pain while walking or exercising (claudication) deficient wound healing and/or leg ulcers. atherosclerosis is often generalized meaning it affects arteries throughout the body. therefore patients with heart attacks are also more likely to develop strokes and peripheral vascular disease and vice versa.,what is atherosclerosis?,['atherosclerosis'],wmd

the best way to answer. would be to measure your baby's weight. in the first month infants are expected to gain .  to  ounces per day. in terms of increasing your milk supply the best thing to do is to feed/pump more often. your milk production works on a supply/demand relationship. the more often you feed your baby (or the more often you pump) the more milk your body will produce. there is nothing wrong with supplementing with formula but if your baby feeds less often as a result you may find that it may ultimately restrict your supply.,my  month old baby doesn't seem to be satisfied when i breastfeed him. can i supplement some feedings with formula?,"['baby', 'feeding', 'breastfeed', 'supplement']",wmd
the bartholin glands or ducts are located at either side of the vaginal opening. they secrete a lubricating fluid. occasionally the opening of the gland will become blocked causing a back-up or accumulation of fluid. this is called a bartholin duct cyst. this is the most common cystic growth in the vulva. sometimes the blockage is the result of an infection such as gonorrhea or chlamydia. the accumulated fluid can become infected as well. at this point it is called a bartholin gland abscess. a bartholin gland abscess can be very painful and requires treatment. the most common treatment is an incision with drainage and antibiotics. usually a wood catheter is placed in the gland to allow continued drainage and a larger opening to the gland to form. this catheter is a short tube with a little balloon on one end and is usually left in place for - weeks. for recurrent cysts or abscesses a procedure called a marsupialization is performed. the gland is surgically opened and then sutured open so that it does not reform. you should discuss with your doctor if you are a candidate for this procedure.,recurring bartholin gland cyst/abcess please help! . . my first one started  years ago when i was pregnant with my sonthe doctor lanced and drained it. since june of this year it has been coming back this is the  one since june i have one currently and i am  months pregnant i had one in june after  agonizing days it tore and drained  in september that had done the same  in october the first  in october i had surgery for lancing and draining again and the second  came about  weeks after and now this is my second  in november. please help,"['cyst', 'pregnancy', 'surgery', 'drainage']",wmd

schizophrenia is a chronic severe and disabling brain disorder that has affected people throughout history. about  percent of americans have this illness. people with the disorder may hear voices other people don't hear. they may believe other people are reading their minds controlling their thoughts or plotting to harm them. this can terrify people with the illness and make them withdrawn or extremely agitated. people with schizophrenia may not make sense when they talk. they may sit for hours without moving or talking. sometimes people with schizophrenia seem perfectly fine until they talk about what they are really thinking. families and society are affected by schizophrenia too. many people with schizophrenia have difficulty holding a job or caring for themselves so they rely on others for help. treatment helps relieve many symptoms of schizophrenia but most people who have the disorder cope with symptoms throughout their lives. however many people with schizophrenia can lead rewarding and meaningful lives in their communities. researchers are developing more effective medications and using new research tools to understand the causes of schizophrenia. in the years to come this work may help prevent and better treat the illness.,what is schizophrenia?,['schizophrenia'],wmd

lupus is an autoimmune disease which means that the immune system mistakes the body's own tissues as foreign invaders and attacks them. some people with lupus suffer only minor inconvenience. others suffer significant lifelong disability. lupus affects people of african asian or native american descent three times as often as it affects whites. nine out of  people with lupus are women. the disease usually strikes between age  and  although it can occur in older individuals. there are two kinds of lupus: discoid lupus erythematosus (dle). systemic lupus erythematosus (sle). dle mainly affects skin that is exposed to sunlight and doesnt typically affect vital internal organs. discoid (circular) skin lesions often leave scars after healing of the lesions. sle is more serious: it affects the skin and other vital organs and can cause a raised scaly butterfly-shaped rash across the bridge of the nose and cheeks that can leave scars if untreated. sle can also affect other parts of the skin elsewhere on the body. aside from the visible effects of systemic lupus the disease may also inflame and/or damage the connective tissue in the joints muscles and skin along with the membranes surrounding or within the lungs heart kidneys and brain. sle can also cause kidney disease. brain involvement is rare but for some lupus can cause confusion depression seizures and strokes. blood vessels may come under attack with systemic lupus. this can cause sores to develop on the skin especially the fingers. some lupus patients get raynaud's syndrome which makes the small blood vessels in the skin contract preventing blood from getting to the hands and feet -- especially in response to cold. most attacks last only a few minutes can be painful and often turn the hands and feet white or a bluish color. lupus patients with raynauds syndrome should keep their hands warm with gloves during cold weather.,what is lupus?,['lupus'],wmd

with age bones begin to lose calcium -- the mineral that makes them hard -- faster than they can replace it. less bone remodeling takes place and the bones begin to thin. for women the loss of bone density speeds up during the first five to seven years after menopause when there is a sharp decline in the body's production of estrogen which appears to help keep calcium in the bones. factors that increase a woman's risk of developing osteoporosis include: being thin or having a small frame. having a family history of osteoporosis. having the ovaries removed. smoking drinking more than moderately or living a sedentary lifestyle. white and asian women are more frequently affected than african-american and hispanic women. certain medical conditions such as kidney disease cushing's syndrome and an overactive thyroid or parathyroid gland increase bone breakdown. glucocorticoids (anti-inflammatory drugs) anti-seizure drugs and prolonged immobility due to paralysis or illness can also cause bone loss.,what causes osteoporosis?,['osteoporosis'],wmd

several nutritional supplements are used to relieve arthritis pain. a couple of the most promising are: glucosamine and chondroitin. these are the building blocks of cartilage -- the smooth covering that cushion joints -- so people often take these supplements for arthritis pain relief. do they work? its debatable. while researchers are still studying whether they help rebuild cartilage some studies have shown that theyve helped relieve knee osteoarthritis pain and stiffness for some people. a multi-center federally funded study found that when taken together they were most helpful for people with moderate to severe oa (osteoarthritis) pain. another study found that a  -mg daily dose of glucosamine relieved knee oa pain significantly more than a  -mg daily dose of acetaminophen (tylenol) or placebo. but other studies have found that they didn't reduce pain. if you decide to try glucosamine and chondroitin talk to your doctor about dosing. and beware of taking glucosamine if you have fish allergies because its most often made from shellfish. chondroitin is made from shark or pork cartilage or made in a lab. omega- fatty acids. you can get these good fats by eating cold-water fish such as salmon or by taking fish oil capsules. these healthy fats have been shown to reduce joint pain and inflammation in people with arthritis.,what nutritional supplements can be used to treat osteoarthritis?,['osteoarthritis'],wmd

moderate amounts of caffeine -- about  milligrams or three cups of coffee -- apparently cause no harm in most healthy adults. some people are more vulnerable to its effects however. that includes such people as those who have high blood pressure or are older. here are the facts: osteoporosis and caffeine. at high levels (more than  milligrams/day) caffeine may increase calcium and magnesium loss in urine. but recent studies suggest it does not increase your risk for bone loss especially if you get enough calcium. you can offset the calcium lost from drinking one cup of coffee by adding just two tablespoons of milk. however research does show some links between caffeine and hip fracture risk in older adults. older adults may be more sensitive to the effects of caffeine on calcium metabolism. if you're an older woman discuss with your doctor whether you should limit your daily caffeine intake to  milligrams or less. cardiovascular disease and caffeine. a slight temporary rise in heart rate and blood pressure is common in those who are sensitive to caffeine. but several large studies do not link caffeine to higher cholesterol irregular heartbeats or an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. if you already have high blood pressure though have a discussion with your doctor about your caffeine intake. you may be more sensitive to its effects. also more research is needed to tell whether caffeine increases the risk for stroke in people with high blood pressure. cancer and caffeine. reviews of  studies involving   people revealed no relationship between cancer and caffeine. in fact caffeine may even have a protective effect against certain cancers.,does caffeine increases the risk for conditions such as osteoporosis heart disease and cancer?,"['heart disease', 'osteoporosis', 'cancer', 'caffeine']",wmd

hi found this on the mayo clinic it should answer your question. seafood can be a great source of protein and the omega- fatty acids in many fish can promote your baby's brain development. however some fish and shellfish contain potentially dangerous levels of mercury. too much mercury could damage your baby's developing nervous system. the bigger and older the fish the more mercury it's likely to contain. the food and drug administration (fda) and the environmental protection agency (epa) encourage pregnant women to avoid: swordfish shark king mackerel tilefish so what's safe? some types of seafood contain little mercury. although concerns have been raised about the level of mercury in any type of canned tuna the fda and epa say pregnant women can safely eat up to  ounces ( grams) a week. similarly the  dietary guidelines for americans recommend  to  ounces of seafood a week for pregnant women. that's about two average meals of: shrimp crab canned light tuna (limit albacore tuna chunk white tuna and tuna steak to no more than  ounces or  grams a week) salmon pollock catfish cod tilapia not all researchers agree with these limits however citing a study that noted no negative effects for women who ate more seafood than the fda-approved guidelines. do hope this helps you and your baby to be. good luck,can i eat canned clams while pregnant?,['pregnancy'],wmd

cancer cells are exquisitely sensitive and in fact stimulated to grow by testosterone. so before a man is put on testosterone therapy its essential that we know he does not have cancer both by an exam and a blood test. and if a man is put on testosterone he needs to be monitored to make sure that a cancer doesnt develop by monitoring the exam and the psa blood test. there are a lot of men out there who are saying ooh my testosterone is a little low i need a little oomph. and theres a downside to that. absolutely. well the problem is that its easy to treat. and men if theyre depressed if theyre feeling a little fatigued if their sex drive is down any reason they go to the doctor and its easy to say aha your testosterone is low give them testosterone replacements where they draw a single level and say this is the problem but thats not the way to do it. but the testosterone level fluctuates dramatically throughout the day and so if you dont draw it at the right time you might get an artificially high or low level so it should be drawn ideally at late to mid-morning. and then you have to understand what it is youre treating. are you treating a symptom or are you treating a blood test result. so we want to treat the man monitor the levels. its important that the levels be appropriate and its important that were sure were treating the right thing. just because his testosterone might be low there might be other more serious or dangerous causes of whats ailing him. hormone imbalances as far as like diabetes thyroid disorders liver disorders. it could be side effects from medication it may be side effects from social activities such as marijuana tobacco or alcohol. all of these things can impact on a man as well as if hes stressed or fatigued that doesnt necessarily mean theres something hormonally wrong. maybe hes not getting enough sleep. :: maybe hes stressed because of work and he just needs to learn stress reduction techniques than try to look for something a shot or a pill that will make things better. today there are a lot of problems treated with testosterone for problems that really arent low testosterone. and we need to be careful because too much testosterone for the wrong reasons can stimulate prostate cancer.,how can testosterone replacement trigger prostate cancer?,"['testosterone', 'prostate cancer']",wmd

fever is the bodys natural response to fighting off infection or inflammation. fever is most prevalent as a response in the younger crowd. the older we get the less often we get fevers to help us get better. fever is good and should not be feared no matter what grandma told you or what you have heard. fever is just a sign not a disease. school authorities will exclude children since they have no idea what the child is biologically cooking. if children have a contagious illness the fever stage — those first few days of an illness — would be time when they are most contagious. with that said exposure to an infectious disease like a common cold or even strep does not necessarily imply that the person exposed will get it. many schools and day care facilities require that a child be fever-free for  hours before coming back to the herd. this is probably a reasonable parameter but  hours after getting back into that classroom the child can get another viral infection and the dance will continue. there are no rules that a child with one viral infection cant get another. many kids especially those new to school or day care will seem to have one continuous cold lasting months. in reality they have had many overlapping (coalescing) viral infections during this period — a new cold starting before the first one went away. some fever facts: * kids will be excluded from school or day care with fever. period. schools set their own rules whether we necessarily agree with them or not. * fever in kids will cost you a lot of missed days at work. period. * fever is the bodys normal response to fighting off an illness — a good thing. it does not require treatment unless the child is uncomfortable. * lowering body temperature does not shorten the course of an illness; if anything it may prolong it. * fevers that occur early in a viral illness are expected and should be welcomed. fevers later in an illness may be a sign of a secondary infection. * keep your cool. fever is a sign not a disease. statistically fevers in kids indicate a viral infection; but not always. your medical provider is your best resource to determine the significance and reason for a fever.,why do schools send home kids with a fever?,['fever'],wmd

there is no sure way to prevent colorectal cancer from returning or showing up in other parts of your body. after you have had it your risk of having it again increases. when it comes back it is called metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer. it often comes back after surgery especially if it was not discovered when it was in an early stage.  this does not mean it will come back in your case. everyone is different. initial treatment for colorectal cancer is followed by regular doctor visits and screening to help catch the cancer if it returns. as part of your follow-up visits you may have: physical exams. the frequency of your physical exams depends on your general health and the type of colorectal cancer you had. in general you will see a doctor every  to  months for  years and then once a year after that. colonoscopy to look at the inside of your intestine for new problems. carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) blood test to check whether colorectal cancer has returned. chest x-rays to find out whether cancer has returned to involve your lungs. lab tests such as a complete blood count and chemistry screen to look for evidence of cancer. a computed tomography (ct) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (mri) to look inside your body. a positron emission tomography (pet) scan to look for and check any signs of cancer. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,how can colorectal cancer metastatic or recurrent be prevented?,['colon cancer'],wmd

you are definitely not alone. however there are some of you out there that actually find relaxation and joy in the process of making dinner after a hectic day. for those of you who fall into that camp consider yourselves part of the elite. if you are already out and near the grocery store and are leaning toward getting prepared foods i would recommend picking simple things that you can quickly add flavor to (and not calories) like rotisserie chicken. just squeeze a couple of fresh lemons on the chicken and top with chopped basil or use limes and top with cilantro. pick out veggies at the salad bar — they are already washed chopped and prepped for you. you can take them home and roast them in a  degree f oven for - minutes with just a bit of soy sauce and extra virgin olive oil. this is a great and easy veggie side dish that wouldnt take much longer than reheating something that would be prepared by the store and laden with butter or fattening oils. sometimes we are too tired to go to the store and deal with anything that would take even just reheating. for instance tonight i got home after  hours of traveling and im battling over what i could make for dinner — or — to pick up thai food. i think that thai is going to win tonight. but i know that what is important if i make that choice is what to order. i could dive into coconut milk soup deep fried spring rolls and curry laden with more coconut milk. while this will be guaranteed to be delicious the extra  calories that can come from some of the richer choices wont be worth it. what will be a much better choice will still be delicious. spring rolls that are fresh — not fried — and are filled with vegetables and fresh mint and cilantro are a delicious healthy choice. another great dish is thai basil chicken and vegetables light oil (ask for that when ordering at any asian restaurants). also any soup without the coconut milk will be an excellent choice. im reminding myself of this as i am you. when im tired and hungry and have cooked for everyone else during the day the first thing i might go for is not always the best choice. another small but important tip is to drink a big glass of water before you order out. many times we are dehydrated as well as hungry so we are even more likely to make impulsive food choices.,any suggestions for healthy eating on nights when i'm too tired to cook after work?,"['drowsiness', 'cooking', 'healthy eating']",wmd

well the thing is you don't want to put ice on it. if you put ice on it believe it or not the burn is kind of open skin in some cases so ice will actually adhere to the skin. so when you try to take the ice off of it you will rip layers of skin with it and possibly cause an infection. the recommendation is really to use tepid or cool water; not super cold but right in the middle and submerse the area. butter and mayonnaise to me are like wives' tales. people believe that they should be putting some type of ointment on it to help replace the moisture in the skin. that is not the case. we found out in a lot of cases now that you need to let the air get to it and let it heal by itself because when they were putting things like ointments and creams on it it was trapping in bacteria leading to skin infections. if you notice though it's blistering and the area is extremely red. you probably need to go and have it looked at by a healthcare provider because there are some prescription ointments and creams that are specifically used for burns.,is it okay to put ice on a burn; what about butter or mayonnaise?,"['burn', 'mayonnaise']",wmd

most helpful answer yes you definitely could have gotten pregnant. you should be alert for a missed period because if you are pregnant you should remove the nuvaring as soon as possible after you know positively you're carrying a baby. like any other type of hormonal birth control method (such as birth control pills) the nuvaring typically takes a month to be considered fully effective. since you didn't wait for the required amount of time before having unprotected sex it's possible for you to have become pregnant. that said it's less typical to become pregnant while you're on your period. a woman is most fertile (likely to become pregnant) a couple of days before her body releases an egg (ovulates). while that time frame is different for every woman it generally occurs around days - for a woman with a regular -day menstrual cycle. the answer to your question then is: it's possible but not likely you got pregnant when you had unprotected sex the same day you inserted the nuvaring. if you ever have questions about your birth control method you can always ask your pharmacist or your gynecologist. wishing you well!,just started using nuvaring on the  day of my period and had sex the same day of the insert-possible pregnancy? . i just started using nuvaring again for the first time on the  day of my period. the last time i was on nuvaring was about  years ago. so i recently had sex the same day i inserted nuvaring. while my husband and i have sexual intercourse he came inside of me with no other secondary protection beside the nuvaring. could there be a possible pregnancy for doing it on the same day? please help if you know any information on that. i am greatfully appreciate it and thank you before hand.,[],wmd

when your child has a sore throat its important to find out if its strep throat or not. ever wonder why? strep (officially called group a streptococcus) is a bacterial infection that needs to be treated with antibiotics. and all the other sore throats caused by the virus of the week just need time and tlc to resolve. why does strep need to be treated? while many people clear the throat infection on their own untreated strep can do some pretty serious damage in other body parts. untreated strep can infect the heart brain and joints. thats called rheumatic fever. and its why we need to know if that sore throat is due to strep bacteria. doctors have always known that strep prefers to infect school-aged kids instead of babies toddlers or preschoolers. but a recent study in the journal pediatrics confirmed this. about % of school-aged children who see their docs for a sore throat will have a strep infection. but only % of children under five years of age have strep when they have a throat infection. bottom line: little kids usually get viral sore throats big kids are more likely to have strep. so how do docs know when its strep throat (besides doing a strep test of course). here are  things that make me think of strep: .  years of age or older? . sore throat without runny nose or cough? . sore throat with headache and/or stomachache? . sore throat and fine pinpoint sandpapery/rough feeling rash (called scarlet fever)? . sore throat and raised dots on the tongue (called strawberry tongue)? . sore throat and a persistent fever for more than a couple of days? .

changes in your breasts are another very early sign of pregnancy. when you conceive your body undergoes a rapid change in hormone levels. because of the changes in hormones you may notice in one to two weeks that your breasts have become swollen sore or tingly. or they may feel heavier or fuller or feel tender to the touch. in addition the area around the nipples called the areola may darken. pregnancy is not the only thing that can cause breast changes. a hormonal imbalance that's unrelated to pregnancy could be responsible. the changes could also be caused by a change in birth control pills or they could be a premenstrual symptom. if the changes are an early symptom of pregnancy keep in mind that it is going to take your body several weeks to get used to the new levels of hormones. but when it does your breasts will feel less painful than they do in the beginning.,how are breast changes early signs of pregnancy?,"['pregnancy', 'breast']",wmd

stevia is a natural sugar substitute that belongs in your diabetes reversal bag of tricks.  medical problems  fueled by excess sugar including obesity type  diabetes heart disease metabolic syndrome and many other weight-related medical problems. i believe stevia can be a significant part of the solution for many individuals. the key advantage of stevia (over artificial sweeteners) is that it is all natural – it comes from the sweetleaf plant that grows primarily in tropical and subtropical regions of western north america to south america. the leaves contain the sweet glycosides stevioside and rebaudioside (discovered in  by french chemists) which are  times sweeter than sucrose (table sugar). the leaves themselves taste sweet and can be used whole or in ground form in food and beverages. more typically the sweet glycosides are extracted from the plant material and sold as a processed powder. some companies sell stevia liquid resulting from dissolving the powder into a liquid which might also contain additional flavor enhancements. stevias taste is on par with other sugar substitutes – sweetness with a mild after-taste. the key to leveraging stevias sweetening power is by masking the after-taste which is easy to do. stevia shines when used to enhance the sweetness of foods or beverages that already have some flavor as well as another source of mild sweetness. its use in the popular beverages vitamin water zero and sobe life water demonstrate that it is gaining traction in the united states. it is usually available as powder packets or concentrated liquid in supermarkets natural foods markets vitamin shops and health food stores. its availability and popularity vary from country to country. it is especially popular in japan where it has been in commercial use for nearly  years. it is becoming increasingly popular in other parts of asia and in australia and i believe it will become increasingly popular in the united states and europe as well. i use it instead of honey sugar date or splenda in fruit smoothies. without the stevia it tastes bland and cries out for some sweetness. it tastes great with the stevia and there is no after-taste since the fruit masks it. here are two favorite recipes: banana strawberry smoothies / banana (frozen)  strawberries (frozen)  cup water  drops liquid stevia chocolate peanut butter banana shake  banana (frozen chunks)  teaspoons natural peanut butter  tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder  ounces water  drops stevia my kids and i love these! there is nothing in there id hesitate to call healthy. another example: my -year old is much happier to drink milk when it has  drops of stevia added. if you have kids that will only drink milk if it is sweetened (eg. with chocolate syrup) but you dont want them consuming so much sugar then stevia drops are your answer. . a -ounce bottle of liquid stevia. provides about  servings (equivalent to about  teaspoons of sugar or over  twelve-ounce cans of soda). this saves over  calories with no effect on blood sugar!,how can stevia help with diabetes?,['diabetes'],wmd

surgery to remove the cancer is the most common treatment for penile cancer. a doctor may take out the cancer using one of the following operations: wide local excision takes out only the cancer and some normal tissue on either side. electrodessication and curettage removes the cancer by scraping the tumor with a curette (thin long instrument with a scraping edge) and applying an electric current to the area to kill cancer cells. cryosurgery uses liquid nitrogen to freeze and kill the cancer cells. microsurgery (moh's surgery) is an operation that removes the cancer and as little normal tissue as possible. during this surgery the doctor uses a microscope to look at the cancerous area to make sure all the cancer cells are removed. laser surgery uses a narrow beam of light to remove cancer cells. circumcision is an operation that removes the foreskin. amputation of the penis (penectomy) is an operation that removes the penis. it is the most common and most effective treatment of cancer of the penis. in a partial penectomy part of the penis is removed. in a total penectomy the whole penis is removed. lymph nodes in the groin may be taken out during surgery. radiation which uses high-energy rays to attack cancer and chemotherapy which uses drugs to kill cancer are other treatment options.,what treatments are given for penile cancer?,['penile cancer'],wmd

there are some simple and effective ounces of prevention parents can and should do to prevent obesity before it starts. start early before conception. overweight parents are more likely to have overweight children so healthy habits need to start well before birth. good prenatal care is needed to help achieve a healthy-weight baby (babies born both underweight and overweight both have a higher risk of obesity as adults. ) after baby is born breastfeeding can help prevent both over- and under-weight. dont introduce juices or other sweet beverages. as a treat once in a while fine but dont bring juice or kool-aid or soda or other sugary drinks into your home. keep televisions out of bedrooms. bedroom tv time contributes not only to obesity but also to depression school failure and social isolation. also dont leave the tv on during meals. people who eat in front of a tv will mindlessly consume far more calories. eat together as a family using mealtimes to talk and enjoy time together. eat slowly. chew. eating slower really does give your body time to realize when youre getting full. parents can set a good example not only at mealtimes but also by maintaining a healthy active lifestyle. allow each child to decide just how much of each offered food is eaten at each meal. parents provide the healthy choices then the kids decide how much to eat. do not offer food rewards or make one delicious food available only if another less desirable food is consumed. food is for eating not bargaining.,how do i prevent my children from becoming overweight?,['corpulence'],wmd

"" some studies show that caffeine causes a physical dependence or addiction. if a person gets withdrawal symptoms when they suddenly stop using caffeine then the person has a physical dependence on caffeine. withdrawal symptoms can include severe headaches muscle aches temporary feelings of depression and irritability. when people experience these symptoms they often just take in more caffeine to make them go away. this cycle is hard to break. if you are trying to cut down on your caffeine intake as a way to manage your incontinence symptoms here are some helpful tips: * learn which foods and drinks commonly contain caffeine so you can remove them slowly from your diet. * cut down on caffeine-containing food and drinks very slowly which should decrease any withdrawal symptoms. * as soon as you start cutting back on caffeine-containing drinks and foods increase your water intake and spread it out throughout the day. this may decrease withdrawal headaches. * if you get a headache take pain relievers that do not include caffeine (check the labels. ) * try to get as much or more sleep than you normally would. * exercise may help you feel better too.",how can i minimize withdrawal symptoms while cutting back on caffeine?,"['caffeine', 'cuts']",wmd
eating certain foods including onions peppermint and high-fat foods as well as drinking alcohol can cause the lower esophageal sphincter muscle which controls the opening between the esophagus and the stomach to relax. when this muscle fails to close the acid-containing contents of the stomach can travel back up into the esophagus producing heartburn. caffeinated beverages and foods (such as coffee tea colas and chocolate) can also aggravate heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd). tomatoes citrus fruits or juices also contribute additional acid that can irritate the esophagus. in addition smoking relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter contributing to heartburn and gerd.,what foods should a person avoid if he or she has heartburn gerd or barrett's esophagus?,"[""barrett's esophagus"", 'heartburn', 'food']",wmd

hi this is from webmd its the part just for you to read. bacterial vaginosis is caused by an imbalance of the organisms (flora) that naturallyexist in the vagina. normally about % of vaginal flora are lactobacillus bacteria. (these types are unique to humans different from the lactobacillus in yogurt. ) these lactobacilli help keep the vaginal ph level low and prevent overgrowth of other types of organisms. women with bacterial vaginosis have fewer lactobacillus organisms than normal and more of other types of bacteria. experts do not yet understand what causes this imbalance. although the specific cause isn't known a number of health and lifestyle factors have been linked to bacterial vaginosis things that increase your risk of getting bacterial vaginosis include: having more than one sex partner or having a new sex partner. smoking. douching. not using condoms. although bacterial vaginosis can be triggered by or get worse from sexual activity it does not appear to be an infection that is passed from man to woman. so experts do not consider bacterial vaginosis to be a male-female sexually transmitted infection. bacterial vaginosis may be passed from woman to woman during sexual contact. do hope it helps you. good luck,can a male contact bacteria vaginosis from one woman and pass it on to another woman? . can a woman get bacteria vaginosis on her own? how and why?,['bacterium'],wmd

normally there are several mechanisms to prevent acid from flowing backwards (refluxing) up into the esophagus. one mechanism involves a band of esophageal muscle where the esophagus joins the stomach called the lower esophageal sphincter that remains contracted most of the time to prevent acid from refluxing or regurgitating. the sphincter only relaxes when food is swallowed allowing food to pass from the esophagus and into the stomach. the sphincter normally is attached firmly to the diaphragm in the hiatus and the muscle of the diaphragm wraps around the sphincter. the muscle that wraps around the sphincter augments the pressure of the contracted sphincter to further prevent reflux of acid. another mechanism that prevents reflux is the valve-like tissue at the junction of the esophagus and stomach just below the sphincter. the esophagus normally enters the stomach tangentially so that there is a sharp angle between the esophagus and stomach. the thin piece of tissue in this angle composed of esophageal and stomach wall forms a valve that can close off the opening to the esophagus when pressure increases in the stomach for example during strenuous exercise. when a hiatal hernia is present two changes occur. first the sphincter slides up into the chest while the diaphragm remains in its normal location. as a result the pressure normally generated by the diaphragm overlying the sphincter and the pressure generated by the sphincter no longer overlap and as a result the total pressure at the gastro-esophageal junction decreases. second when the gastro-esophageal junction and stomach are pulled up into the chest with each swallow the sharp angle where the esophagus joins the stomach becomes less sharp and the valve-like effect is lost. both changes promote reflux of acid.,how does a hiatal hernia cause gerd?,"['heartburn', 'hiatal hernia']",wmd

"ah gravity. it gets to all of us ladies sooner or later doesn't it? unfortunately i don't have good news for you. whether your breasts are naturally droopy due to age or whether you feel breastfeeding took an unkind toll the only way to lift those breasts back up is through breast lift surgery (also called mastopexy or mammoplasty). plastic surgeons and cosmetic surgeons perform this procedure which isn't usually covered by insurance. if you really don't want to go through surgery the only other way to lift the breast up a bit is to use some sort of padding (you can buy silicone bra inserts) and a very good bra. i recommend you see a certified bra fitter as a first step. the vast majority of women do not wear the correct size bra. a bra fitter will measure you to determine your real bra size and then help you choose a bra that gives you the best lift. a bra fitter may also be able to help you find an insert to help your breasts look as good as possible in a bra. in terms of various creams and potions you may see advertised to ""firm the breasts "" i want to mention there is absolutely no scientific evidence that they work -- and no reason they would work. droopy or saggy breasts are largely due to stretched-out skin. no cream or lotion can fix that. all the best to you!",how do you lift saggy breast up without surgery?,"['breast', 'surgery']",wmd
"most of us have a sense of which eating and exercising habits (or lack thereof) have gotten us into trouble and stand in the way of our shedding pounds. it's staying motivated that's the hard part. but there may be help for you in unexpected places. how about a little help from. your employer? if you're not looking to your employee benefits or even your insurance company for help reaching your health goals you may be missing out.

the goal of treating most cases of ordinary urticaria is to relieve symptoms while the condition goes away by itself. the most commonly used oral treatments are antihistamines which help oppose the effects of the histamine leaked by mast cells. the main side effect of antihistamines is drowsiness. many antihistamines are available without prescription such as diphenhydramine (benadryl) taken in doses of  milligrams and chlorpheniramine (chlor-trimeton) taken in a dose of  milligrams. these can be taken up to three times a day but because these medications can cause drowsiness they are often taken at bedtime. those who take them should be especially careful and be sure they are fully alert before driving or participating in other activities requiring mental concentration. loratadine (claritin  milligrams) is an antihistamine available over the counter that is less likely to cause drowsiness. also approved for over-the-counter use is hydroxyzine (atarax vistaril) which causes drowsiness and its breakdown product cetirizine (zyrtec  milligrams) which is mildly sedating. antihistamines that require a prescription include cyproheptadine (periactin) which tends to cause drowsiness. prescription antihistamines that cause little sedation are fexofenadine (allegra) and levocetirizine (xyzal). sometimes physicians combine these with other types of antihistamines called  blockers such as ranitidine (zantac) and cimetidine (tagamet). this antihistamine list is not exhaustive. physicians individualize treatment plans to suit specific patients and modify them depending on the clinical response. oral steroids (prednisone ) can help severe cases of hives in the short term but their usefulness is limited by the fact that many cases of hives last too long for steroid use to be continued safely. other treatments have been used for urticaria as well including montelukast (singulair) ultraviolet radiation antifungal antibiotics agents that suppress the immune system and tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline  nortriptyline  doxepin ). evidence to support the benefit of such treatments is sparse. in ordinary cases they are rarely needed. topical therapies for hives are available but are generally ineffective. they include creams and lotions which help numb nerve endings and reduce itching. some ingredients which can accomplish this are camphor menthol diphenhydramine and pramoxine. many of these topical preparations require no prescription. cortisone-containing creams (steroids) even strong ones requiring a prescription are not very helpful in controlling the itch of hives.,what is the treatment for hives?,['hives'],wmd

you may have to undergo an endoscopy to biopsy your small intestine to confirm that you have celiac disease. typically a blood test may be done first since it can be an indicator and is less invasive but a biopsy is better at confirming a diagnosis. you may also want to attempt an elimination diet to determine any food allergies sensitivities or intolerances that you may have. this type of diet starts out very basic and restrictive but you will gradually start to reintroduce certain foods back into your diet one at a time and monitor your bodys response. if you have an allergy or sensitivity you may notice side effects when you reintroduce different foods. this isnt meant to replace a proper diagnosis but it can help provide you with an association and causal relationship. another option might be to keep a food journal and write down your dietary intake each day. you may be able to better identify triggers and notice trends between symptoms and foods consumed by doing so. it may then be worthwhile for you to discuss treatment and management options with other health professionals like another doctor or a registered dietitian. i'm sorry you're coping with celiac disease which is an autoimmune condition that renders the body unable to process gluten (a component of wheat) and causes the body to attack its own small intestine when gluten is consumed. your doctor did the right thing in advising you to avoid foods that contain gluten. in fact this is the only treatment for celiac disease. however it sounds like you might have been offered more resources and support than you received. you might want to consult a medical provider who specializes in digestive disorders to have your diagnosis confirmed and receive more specific counseling. because celiac disease isn't just a digestive disorder but also causes damage to your small intestine it's important you understand how to manage this disease. a specialist may be able to offer you that type of thorough support. webmd also offers a great digestive disorders community. you might consider checking in there to find the celiac disease group and start chatting with others who share your condition. wishing you well!,diagnosed with celiac disease but not given any care. what is my next step? . i was given a blood test and told by my family doctor that i had celiac disease and to stop eating gluten  years ago. i was never referred to a doctor who deals with my disease or given any other tests or scopes. being as its  years after the diagnosis should i try to consult a doctor for better care?,"['blood test', 'family']",wmd

duodenitis is inflammation of the duodenum the first portion of the small intestine. the duodenum is a tube around a foot long. its near end connects to the stomach; the duodenums far end blends into the rest of the small intestine. duodenitis can only be diagnosed with a tissue biopsy which is performed using endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy). the duodenum can become inflamed (irritated swollen and occupied by white blood cells) for various reasons. the most common is infection by h. pylori a bacteria that lives in the stomach and/or duodenum. about half of americans over age  have been infected with h. pylori at some point in life. h. pylori stimulates increased acid production by the stomach and causes low-grade inflammation of the duodenum (duodenitis). symptoms can include pain in the middle of the belly or indigestion. in some cases the inflammation of duodenitis worsens to create a small sore (ulcer) in the duodenums wall. less commonly inflammatory conditions can cause duodenitis: crohn's disease ulcerative colitis whipples disease severe stress caused by surgery or a serious infection (sepsis) cases of duodenitis or duodenal ulcer caused by h. pylori can usually be cured with antibiotics and stomach acid-suppressing drugs.,what is duodenitis?,['duodenitis'],wmd

headache which you have described could be migraines. i would need to know answer of few questions which would help me in getting to the right diagnosis. any history of headache (ha) in your wife's family or your children? how does the headache feel - throbbing pulsating or pressure type? does she get any aura (symptoms) prior to start of her ha such as flashing of lights colors stars black dots etc? did she experience any numbness over face or fingers? describe her ha severity in grade -  - minimum and  - maximum. what brings her ha and what relieves it? for example sleep food and dark room. is she sensitive to noise and sound during her ha? does she get nausea or vomiting with these ha? does she get any redness in eyes tearing in eyes (left eye) with these ha? does she have any motion sickness brain freeze with ice cream or wet hands? does she take any medicine for these ha? since your ha frequency are frequent (when they occur they occur as multiple episodes in a day). once i have answers to these questions i would discuss about management (drugs). in the interim it is good and reassuring that ct head is normal which tells you there is no mass occupying lesion or increase icp (intracranial pressure). also mild increase in tsh (thyroid stimulating hormone) should not be associated with her ha. things she should do in the interim are drink water  l per day and keep herself well hydrated. exercise daily and run  km at  km/hour speed at least. have a good sleep for eight hours a day. revert back with the answers for the above questions to a neurologist online --> <link>,my wife has peculiar headache near left ear. what is it?,['migraine'],ic

i know that it is difficult to feel sick and have no insurance. perhaps you can borrow the money from family or friends to see a primary care doctor and have some basic blood studies done. it seems that the breathing of welding fumes can be hazardous and related to your medical symptoms. a company called plymovent talks about breathing in of welding fumes as follows: the content of the welding rods coatings filler metals and base materials also greatly impacts your health. the biggest potential threat is exposure to the manganese contained in fumes that are given off during welding. inhaling manganese can cause very serious damage to your brain and nervous system. many individuals who are exposed to welding fumes suffer from parkinsons disease a major disorder affecting movement and balance. they often develop manganism  a disease closely related to parkinsons that also makes it difficult to walk and move properly. both manganism and parkinsons disease cause tremors shaking and loss of muscle control. these conditions can become more severe as time passes. when the welding rod or base metal is iron or mild steel iron oxide may be contained in the welding fumes in addition to manganese. breathing in iron oxide irritates your nasal passages throat and lungs. working with stainless steel may produce welding fumes containing nickel and chromium. if you have asthma exposure to nickel can make your illness worse. chromium can aggravate or cause sinus problems. both nickel and chromium may cause cancer according to niosh (safety and health fact sheet no.  american welding society; welding fumes and gases center to protect workers rights). welding on some plated or painted metals may be especially hazardous (welding fumes sampling mine safety and health administration). cadmium is often used as a coating on steel to prevent rust. however cadmium in welding fumes causes the lung disease emphysema as well as kidney failure (cadmium exposure from welding american welding society; welding health hazards osha). if you cut a metal that has been coated with paint that contains lead it may give off welding fumes containing lead oxide. inhaling these welding fumes can cause lead poisoning a condition in which you become weak and develop anemia (a low red blood cell count). lead also harms your nervous system kidneys and reproductive system (lead atsdr). some welding rods are coated with asbestos. if you inhale asbestos dust that is released into the air you are at risk for developing serious asbestos–related diseases. these include lung cancer an aggressive cancer called mesothelioma and asbestosis which is a scarring of the lungs. i dont want all of these many medical conditions to cause you great worry or to become obsessed with thoughts of doom. i just wanted to honestly tell you what honest research has to say about breathing in welding fumes. of course your danger from incurring any of the above referenced medical conditions is probably directly related to the amount of time spent welding and the quantity of exposure material.,breathed in welding fumes pressure on left side of head confusion and nasal drainage. i was welding on stone steps and there was some type of sealant on the steel part ground it off some left over and melted into fumes while welding i feel confused at times and have a feeling of pressure on back left side of head with nasal drainage. er doctor said it was a cold and gave me cold medicine. i believe he was no help since i do not have insurance. today is third day with this feeling scared it's permanent. started fasting and detoxing to rid body of toxins. advice please! . thanks.,"['pressure', 'head', 'confusion', 'drainage', 'coldness']",wmd
"unfortunately you can. genital herpes can end up on your mouth through oral sex for instance. and it is possible for this to happen even when you do not have active lesions. this is the chance that you will both need to take if this was your underlying concern. you have most likely seen many people with cold sores/or fever blisters. these are typically type  herpes lesions but you can get type  lesions (genital types) on your mouth. with that said you are both actively producing antibodies to suppress the genital outbreaks. theoretically this should limit the spread to other areas but not totally eliminate the possibility. the fact that you both have herpes not at least solves part of the problem. if one of you has active lesions i am sure that sexual activity would not be high on your to-do list at least until you are better. are you both taking suppression drugs? these are daily anti-herpes medicines you can take to limit recurrent outbreaks. you have to differentiate between what is likely and what is theoretically possible and what is the worst possible scenario if the thing that you do not want to happen happens. for example it is normally accepted that people do not catch measles twice. when we catch an infection we make antibodies to fight that infection and to prevent us from catching it again. that said it is possible to find people who have caught measles twice so it is not impossible. in the case of herpes simplex the virus is usually caught on one part of the body. we even give it a different name if it is caught in a different place: 'genital herpes' or 'cold sore' or 'whitlow' (on the finger or hand). though the virus may be confined to one dermatome our antibodies cover the whole body and usually prevent reinfection on different sites. in other words our bodies are primed to prevent reinfection. if reinfection does (unusually) happen it tends to happen to people whose immune systems are weakened by other infections or conditions and not to average healthy individuals. if reinfection does take place (and i stress it is rare) then you will have caught a cold sore on the lip. around three quarters of adults have caught a facial cold sore infection by middle age and most of them notice little or nothing in the way of symptoms or recurrences. let's not get hysterical about the common cold sore. shedding is most likely to be happening in the first year or so and declines thereafter. by its very nature shedding is virus on the skin at a low level so is unlikely to be present in sufficient quantity to overwhelm the immune system on a different part of the body of a person who already has antibodies. dr. moser thanks for your answer. trying to reply to your post but can't seem to do that (i'm new to webmd) so i'll post an ""answer"". answer is no neither of us are taking meds. i've been reading about the various meds. wondering which one(s) you would recommend and why? fyi i never have outbreaks but she does. two since contracting it from me  months ago. thank you.",herpes transmission somewhat complicated question. i have genital herpes but no outbreaks after the initial one. my partner got it from me and has genital outbreaks. we're wondering if we're able to spread it to each other in areas where we haven't had outbreaks during shedding (not active outbreak). seems obvious that we could spread it around while there are lesions so we're careful during her outbreaks. but the big mystery is . can we spread it to new areas during shedding. . ? . thanks a million. we've been searching hard for the answer. .,"['genital herpes', 'herpes']",wmd
liposuction isn't weight loss surgery. it is cosmetic surgery. you do lose fat cells but the most is - pounds of fat and most doctors take out less since it is dangerous to take out more. in fact you might even retain water after the surgery which could increase weight. and if you do consume more calories then you burn you will gain weight liposuction or not. the point is this. if you do not continue with or start lifestyle changes like regular exercise and consuming the same or fewer calories than you burn then you will gain weight. liposuction simply is not a substitute for these things and doesn't magically cause weight loss. you can ask the doctor how much fat was removed and get the weight of it and if you have another procedure that would add to it but again if you're loooking for significant weight loss liposuction will not do that.,i have dropped a clothing size through liposuction and tightening will i also lose weight?,"['diet', 'liposuction']",wmd

surgery for hyperthyroidism (thyroidectomy) removes part or all of the thyroid gland. doctors rarely use this surgery to treat hyperthyroidism. you may need surgery if: your thyroid gland is so big that it is hard for you to swallow or breathe. you have thyroid cancer or your doctor suspects you have thyroid cancer. for more information see the topic thyroid cancer. you had serious side effects from taking antithyroid medicines. and radioactive iodine is not an option for you. you have a large goiter that radioactive iodine treatment did not shrink. you have a single large thyroid nodule that is making too much thyroid hormone and radioactive iodine did not effectively treat the nodule. surgery choices the only surgery for hyperthyroidism is thyroidectomy. what to think about if you are having surgery your doctor will have you take antithyroid medicines before surgery to bring your thyroid hormone levels as close to normal as possible. after surgery your doctor will check your thyroid hormone levels regularly because you may develop hypothyroidism (too little thyroid hormone). hypothyroidism is treated with thyroid hormone medicine. for more information see the topic hypothyroidism. surgery is the fastest way to treat your hyperthyroidism. but it is not used very often and is more risky and expensive than other treatments. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,what surgery options do i have for hyperthyroidism?,"['hyperthyroidism', 'surgery']",wmd

there are two ways atherosclerosis causes disease. ) atherosclerosis can limit the ability of the narrowed arteries to increase delivery of blood and oxygen to tissues during periods of increased oxygen demand such as during exertion. ) complete obstruction of an artery by a thrombus or embolus (thrombus and embolus are forms of blood clots) resulting in tissue necrosis (death of tissue). exertional angina and intermittent claudication are two examples of insufficient delivery of blood and oxygen to meet tissue demand. strokes and heart attacks are examples of death of tissue caused by complete artery obstruction by blood clots. there are many similarities between coronary artery diseases (atherosclerosis involving the arteries of the heart) and peripheral artery disease. for example patients with exertional angina typically have no symptoms at rest. but during exertion the critically narrowed coronary arteries are incapable of increasing blood and oxygen delivery to meet the increased oxygen needs of the heart muscles. lack of blood and oxygen causes chest pain (exertional angina). exertional angina typically subsides when the patient rests. in patients with intermittent claudication the narrowed arteries in the lower extremities (for example a narrowed artery at the groin) cannot increase blood and oxygen delivery to the calf muscles during walking. these patients experience pain in the calf muscles that will only subside after resting. patients with unstable angina have critically narrowed coronary arteries that cannot deliver enough blood and oxygen to the heart muscle even at rest. these patients have chest pain at rest and are at imminent risk of developing heart attacks. patients with severe artery occlusion in the legs can develop rest pain (usually in the feet). rest pain represents such severe occlusion that there is insufficient blood supply to the feet even at rest. they are at risk of developing foot ulcers and gangrene. when the arteries are narrowed as a result of atherosclerosis blood tends to clot in the narrowed areas forming a so-called thrombus (plural thrombi). sometimes pieces of the thrombi break off and travel in the bloodstream until they are trapped in a narrower point in the artery beyond which they cannot pass. a thrombus or piece of thrombus that travels to another point is called an embolus (pleural emboli). thrombi and emboli can cause sudden and complete artery blockage leading to tissue necrosis (death of tissue). for example complete blockage of a coronary artery by a thrombus causes heart attack while complete blockage of a carotid or cerebral artery causes ischemic stroke. emboli originating from atherosclerosis in the aorta (the main artery delivering blood to the body) can obstruct small arteries in the feet resulting in painful and blue (cyanotic) toes foot ulcers and even gangrene.,how does atherosclerosis cause disease?,['atherosclerosis'],wmd
benadryl is very effective for hives because of the fast onset of the medication but only lasts about four hours. zyrtec tends to be slower in onset but lasts longer ( hours). both are antihistamines of course and most of the time you only need one of the other. on some occasions however when you have taken zyrtec in the  hours you can still get hives so it is safe to take a dose of benadryl. benadryl does cause sedation so please be careful if you need to drive. if the hives don't clear up fairly quickly or if they're accompanied by difficulty breathing your wife should seek immediate medical attention. these can be the signs of a severe allergic reaction to something -- food medication etc. if your wife gets hives occasionally (as some people do) and they are not accompanied by other symptoms then i'd suggest she speak to her doctor about getting a prescription specifically for the hives. there are medications other than benadryl that are used to treat hives. in terms of combining antihistamines i'd suggest you speak to a pharmacist. while benadryl (diphenhydramine) has a different chemical composition than zyrtec (cetirizine) they still are both the same class of medication. generally we try not to combine medications of the same class unless specifically directed to do so by a physician. i hope that gives you some clarity. why would you want to take two antihistamines. you may want to talk to a doctor and get a stronger prescription antihistamine if either of these are not very effective for you.,can i take benadryl with zyrtec. my wife has hives on her chest and arms that just poped up last night.,"['hives', 'arm', 'chest']",wmd

the small intestine has an inner lining of cells that form finger-like projections called villi. the villi are important because they increase the number of cells and surface area available for the absorption of nutrients from the intestinal lumen into the bloodstream. in celiac disease inflammation destroys the villi causing the inner lining of the small intestine to become flattened. this loss of villi reduces the cells and surface area available for absorption of nutrients. the impaired absorption of nutrients is referred to as malabsorption. the malabsorption of nutrients leads to nutrient deficiencies referred to as malnutrition. the length (amount) of the small intestine affected by the loss of villi varies from patient to patient and the length that is involved determines the severity of signs and symptoms. thus patients whose entire small intestine is affected by a loss of villi have more severe signs and symptoms of malabsorption than patients who have only part of the small intestine affected. when only part of the small intestine is affected it usually is the upper small intestine (the duodenum and jejunum) that is more affected than the lower small intestine (the ileum).,what does celiac disease do to the small intestine?,"['celiac disease', 'small intestine']",wmd

viruses causing hemorrhagic fever are initially transmitted to humans when the activities of infected reservoir hosts or vectors and humans overlap. the viruses carried in rodent reservoirs are transmitted when humans have contact with urine fecal matter saliva or other body excretions from infected rodents. the viruses associated with arthropod vectors are spread most often when the vector mosquito or tick bites a human or when a human crushes a tick. however some of these vectors may spread the virus to animals -- livestock for example. humans then become infected when they care for or slaughter the animals. some viruses that cause hemorrhagic fever can spread from one person to another once an initial person has become infected. ebola marburg lassa and crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever viruses are examples. this type of secondary transmission of the virus can occur directly through close contact with infected people or their body fluids. it can also occur indirectly through contact with objects contaminated with infected body fluids. for example contaminated syringes and needles have played an important role in spreading infection in outbreaks of ebola hemorrhagic fever and lassa fever.,how are hemorrhagic fever viruses transmitted?,"['hemorrhagic fever', 'virus']",wmd

"a stress fracture is a fracture of the bone that is not caused by trauma. when it comes to the hip and pelvis there are two common kinds of fractures (breaks). the first is a traumatic fracture. this is caused by something like a fall or an auto accident. in a traumatic fracture of the hip the ends of the bones may or may not align with each other. for example it's not uncommon for the head of the femur (the ""thigh bone"") to break off in the socket of the pelvis. traumatic fractures of the hip almost always require surgery. in contrast a stress fracture of the hip or pelvis can occur from ordinary weight-bearing activities like walking. if a person has osteoporosis (thin bones) the simple activity of walking can cause small fractures (breaks) in the hip or pelvis. in general these breaks are relatively minor. sometimes they are called ""hairline fractures"" because the pieces of bones stay in place. stress fractures often can be treated with rest and diet changes like increasing calcium and/or vitamin d. calcium and vitamin d help bones stay strong. after a period of time the bones may knit back together on their own. if you've been diagnosed with a stress fracture of the hip or pelvis be sure to follow your doctor's instructions carefully. a stress fracture may be a sign of weak bones. you will want to follow all medical instructions to make sure the bone heals and you have no further problems. wishing you well!",what is a stress fracture in the hip,['stress fracture'],wmd

symptoms of transient ischemic attacks (tias) develop suddenly and are always temporary. they usually go away within  to  minutes. tia symptoms are just like stroke symptoms. they vary depending on which part of the brain is affected. common symptoms of tia include: weakness on one side of your body or an inability to move a part or all of one side of your body such as your face arm and leg. numbness tingling or a feeling of heaviness on one side of your body. trouble seeing such as blurring or double vision dimness or a sensation that a shade has been pulled down over the eyes. trouble speaking or finding words. trouble understanding words. vertigo unsteadiness dizziness clumsiness staggering or fainting. you may have trouble walking. you may also have a drop attack which is a sudden loss of strength in your legs. it is not always easy to recognize a transient ischemic attack (tia) because you may think that the symptoms are caused by normal aging or other conditions. but you should treat any symptoms of a tia as an emergency because you have no way to know whether they are from a stroke or a tia. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,what are the symptoms of transient ischemic attack tia?,"['transient ischemia attack', 'transient ischemic attack']",wmd

most helpful answer the easy answer would be any exercise. find an activity that you like. it can be as simple as walking (aerobic) or even taking up a sport like tennis. the best exercise program is really one that you will do on a regular consistent basis at least three or more times per week. find a partner - it is easier to exercise with a friend. having type  diabetes means you need to make the time. having a busy schedule is the norm for everyone. the insulin you take daily makes up for the little insulin that you produce. metformin helps sensitizes your body and muscles to insulin. in people with diabetes the only way to break and improve insulin resistance and reduce your risk of heart disease and other complications is by using muscles. most any type of regularly performed physical activity will do. find something you like it helps increase the chance that you will stick to it. a buddy system for exercise also helps make you more accountable and less likely to miss out on the social mental and physical benefits of exercise. a combination of aerobic type exercise and weights targeting core muscles is something to aim for. find an endocrinologist that is passionate about working with people that have type  diabetes. the surgeon general recommends  minutes of moderate intensity physical activity most days per week. for individuals with diabetes its recommended that there should not be more than two consecutive days without aerobic physical activity because the benefit of increased insulin sensitivity gained from exercise generally doesnt last longer than - hours. moreover high-intensity physical activity will tend to enhance insulin sensitivity more than low-intensity physical activity. also a greater duration spent on exercise appears to more effective than a lesser duration. with both intensity and duration however the benefits appear to be a result of more energy being expended. exercise can significantly lower  levels and can even help glycemic control during times when not exercising. both resistance training and aerobic exercise have helpful effects on insulin and can help with diabetes management. do not exercise if your blood sugar is too low and stop exercise if you feel faint have chest tightness or are extremely short of breath. i generally recommend a combination of both aerobic exercise and some resistance exercise in most of my patients. and the good news is that most people can do low-impact exercise (like walking) and still see a benefit. you should talk to your doctor about your own specific exercise prescription. and while you're asking see if your doctor is exercising too! walking is the best exercise for everything! if you don't seem to have time to go and walk park as far from the door at work grocery store drug store anywhere you go as possible. then walk briskly while going in and out and if possible while you are shopping. this will help some and hopefully make you want to walk more and get into a routine! you can always find  min  times a week to walk!,i have type ii diabetes. what is the best form of exercise for my condition? . i take metformin twice a day and insulin in the evening. i would like a recommendation on a good exercise program especially since i have a busy and sometimes inconsistant schedule.,"['diabetes', 'insulin', 'exercise']",wmd
there doesnt seem to be any bigger controversy in nutrition than discussing everyones opinion regarding what is the healthiest most ideal diet. my take on the matter is that there doesnt have to be only one single diet or eating plan that everyone should follow; rather there may be many different paths that you can take to eat healthy and achieve a healthy diet. choosing the right diet can be difficult. the biggest factor that you have to first consider is whats going to work well for you. try to figure out what you want to accomplish by changing your diet. is there a particular benefit or health outcome that youre trying to achieve? certain diets may be better than others in providing different health outcomes so you first need to identify what you want to get out of your diet. the next part is to learn to set realistic expectations for yourself. will a certain diet be too restrictive for you or completely eliminate all the foods that you enjoy? do you think that youll feel hungry all the time or wont be able to have anything to eat in social situations? you need to contemplate whether the eating plan that youre looking at will actually work well for you. of course you may have to make some concessions and compromises with your diet sure but you also need to be realistic in whats going to be achievable and manageable for you. a good way to start is to make slow and gradual changes to your eating habits. pick maybe one aspect of your diet that you would like to improve upon and work on changing that area first. once youre successful there begin to make other changes until you finally reach a place where youre comfortable with your diet. this strategy may work well to help ensure that you dont overwhelm yourself by trying to make a drastic change or trying to do too much too soon. remember you need to approach this in a manner that you can sustain long term as part of a lifestyle change not as a short term solution to a problem. with all of that said to answer your question the paleo (caveman) diet has become quite popular. its a relatively low carbohydrate high protein diet that emphasizes grass-fed beef fish eggs fresh fruits and fresh vegetables; while it excludes dairy grains and refined/processed foods. see if this diet will work for you and feel free to explore other diets by reviewing diets a-z. personally i reccommend the paleo lifestyle. you can get all the information you need online you don't have to buy a book or anything. it is also called the caveman diet and it is pretty balanced. a website called the daily apple (google it) is helpful and also free. i find that eating paleo (or at least mostly paleo) is fairly balanced and fairly low carb. the main idea as you may know is to avoid eating things we wouldn't have had before agriculture. think vegetables lean meat fruit nuts seeds eggs animal based fats fish limited beans. it eliminates a lot of the junk we all eat and it helps you feel a lot fuller and more energetic. the biggest problem for me is cost. i use a somewhat modified version in that i add cheese and yogurt a somewhat pastoralist variation. for healthy dieting combination of slow carbs fast carbs & protein is necessary. so if we have meals containing these in proper combination it will help to loose weight naturally. i'm following a diet called food lovers fat loss system by tryfoodlovers is based on this principle. it helped me to loose fat in a healthy manner.,"what is the best low carb high protein diet? . in the past i have done the high protein diet however in my opinion there were not enough fruits or vegetables you could eat ""legally"". with some of the new ideas out there i think that has changed some. i would love to know which of the low carb/high protein diets is most recommended. and where to get the information about such a diet. thank you for any help you can give.","['high protein diet', 'diet', 'fruit', 'vegetable']",wmd
there's really no way to tell what's going on without seeing your healthcare provider. however the intense itching especially at night and the red pimple-like rash sounds a lot like scabies an infection caused by a mite. typically the rash continues as the intense itching becomes unbearable. remember it's impossible to tell without being evaluated. scabies is a common skin infection and the most common symptom is intense itching mostly at night or after taking a bath. if this sounds like what you are experiencing the infection needs to be treated by a doctor. it very contagious and other members of your family or close contacts can easily get infected. it's important to seek treatment if it is scabies it won't go away on its own.,just over a week ago i stayed over at a friends house and it was very filthy. i noticed red spots all over my body later. the spots have cleared up but now i'm feeling itchy at night commonly in bed. i'm not sure if i'm just being paranoid or if something is wrong. i'm not getting any new red spots.,['paranoid behavior'],wmd

running will burn more calories than the elliptical although it's pretty close (about  calories per hour difference). some of the difference is due to the pounding of running and the fact that you propel your body through the air so that both feet are off the ground simultaneously. this kind of movement takes lots of energy. both the elliptical and running burn substantially more calories than the bike at the same level of perceived exertion (about - calories per hour more). in a classic study comparing energy expenditure of exercise machines the order of calories burned from highest to lowest is posted below. (the elliptical was not studied in this research but it would fit between rowing and cross-country skiing. it should be noted that rowing the elliptical and cross-country skiing are all very close in calorie expenditure with probably not more than - calories per hour difference among them. ) treadmill walking/running stair stepping rowing cross-country skiing biking (stationary) now this is not to say that exercises that burn the fewest calories are all bad. to the contrary you can get a great workout and burn lots of calories doing any of them. you'd be hard pressed to say that lance armstrong isn't fit. he's one of the fittest human beings alive and he did it by biking. the point is that if you work hard enough on any of the exercise machines and you work up a sweat and you get your heart rate into your training zone then your heart lungs and muscles aren't going to know the difference. bottom line is that you'll get fit and healthy using any of the machines if you use them consistently and with sufficient intensity. one final note: there is error in estimating energy expenditure on most if not all exercise machines. in some cases it can be as high as  percent (the machine overestimates how many calories you burn). there are simply too many variables for the machine to give you an accurate number and so you need to keep that in mind during weight-loss efforts if you are calculating how many calories to eat based on your energy expenditure.,does using an elliptical machine at the gym burn more calories than running on the street or bike riding?,"['burn', 'running', 'calorie']",wmd

"it depends on the type of meat you are using for lunch. some are loaded with preservatives salt etc. while others are quite healthy. chicken and turkey slices are generally good (assuming the source of the poultry is an organic farm). the same goes for sliced beef. ham bologna salami etc. are highly-processed so these should be used more sparingly. why not have meatless lunches like a salad or whole grain pasta? i'm happy to hear of your lunch meat concerns. lunch meats are full of toxins in the form of sodium preservatives nitrates and sometimes processing chemicals. this processing takes the form of cutting scraps of meat (and who knows what else) such as stomachs tongues and intestines of various animals like pigs cows and chickens the scraps are formed into the shape of a loaf and processed with preserving chemicals. lunch meat will contribute to weight gain and make a person feel sluggish. it is lacking in the nutrients necessary for energy and overall optimal physical and mental health. although some lunch meat brands may have better quality control i do not believe that there is much of a difference in their products from store to store. it's all poison to our systems and may even be responsible for facilitating some types of cancer. here are some better lunch choices: grilled chicken salad with cranberries avocado and cucumbers salmon salad mozzarella and tomato salad goat-cheese salad- cook an extra chicken breast at dinner and then toss it with pecans strawberries blueberries tomatoes and spinach chicken quesadillas. you can locate on the internet boat loads of exciting lunch-time recipes that are interesting rich in color full of natural flavors nourishing filling low in calories and promote a healthy life style. consider purchasing some relatively inexpensive container to replace your ""brown bag"". these containers will allow you to prepare lunch the evening before keep your lunch chilled may include built-in condiment cups and maintain a separate division for individual ingredients and side-dishes. lunch does not have to be boring or unhealthy.",is lunch meat considered healthy? is there a better alternative that isn't cooking your own meat eveyday? . looking for an easy option for lunch everyday. concerned about preservatives/nitrates in lunch meat. i'm sure it's conditional but would the deli in a grocery store generally be considered healthier?,"['meat', 'cooking', 'preservative']",wmd

there are three basic steps for injecting copaxone prefilled syringes: gather the materials. choose the injection site. give yourself the injection. step : gather the materials. first place each of the items you will need on a clean flat surface in a well-lit area: one blister pack with copaxone prefilled syringe. remove only one blister pack from the copaxone prefilled syringe carton. keep all unused syringes in the prefilled syringe carton and store them in the refrigerator. alcohol prep (wipe). dry cotton ball (not supplied). let the blister pack with the syringe inside warm up to room temperature for  minutes. to prevent infection wash and dry your hands. do not touch your hair or skin after washing. there may be small air bubbles in the syringe. to avoid loss of medicine when using copaxone prefilled syringes do not expel (or do not attempt to expel) the air bubble from the syringe before injecting the medicine. step : choose the injection site. there are seven possible injection areas on your body: arms thighs hips and lower stomach area (abdomen). (see figure  ). each day pick a different injection area from one of the seven areas. do not inject in the same area more than once a week. within each injection area there are multiple injection sites. have a plan for rotating your injection sites. keep a record of your injection sites so you know where you have injected. there are some sites in your body that may be difficult to reach for self-injection (like the back of your arm) and you may need help. do not inject in sites where skin depression has occurred because further injections in these sites may make the depression deeper. step : give yourself the injection. remove the syringe from its protective blister pack by peeling back the paper label. before use look at the liquid in the syringe. if it is cloudy or contains any particles do not use it and call shared solutions at --- for assistance. if the liquid is clear place the syringe on the clean flat surface. choose an injection site on your body. clean the injection site with a new alcohol prep and let the site air dry to reduce stinging. pick up the syringe as you would a pencil. remove the needle shield from the needle. with your other hand pinch about a two-inch fold of skin between your thumb and index finger (see figure  ). insert the needle at a -degree angle (straight in) resting the heel of your hand against your body. when the needle is all the way in release the fold of skin (see figure  ). to inject the medicine hold the syringe steady and push down the plunger. when you have injected all of the medicine pull the needle straight out. press a dry cotton ball on the injection site for a few seconds. do not rub the injection site. throw away the syringe in a safe hard-walled plastic container.,how do i inject copaxone?,['injection'],wmd

"two approaches can be taken to this important question. one is the rigorously scientific approach. it does not go beyond the facts: that most children diagnosed with frank fas have had overtly alcoholic mothers (who drank at least eight to  drinks a day); that children born to women who had four to six drinks a day have had subtle signs of fas/fae; that at two drinks a day the only indisputable effect noted has been subtly lower birth weight; and that below two drinks a day there is no concrete evidence for an effect on the fetus. thus from a strictly scientific viewpoint one cannot say that one drink a day during pregnancy is dangerous to the baby. the more common approach and the favored one is the better-safe-than-sorry approach. this pragmatic position is espoused by public-health experts. witness the warning label on all alcoholic beverages in the u. s. indicating that ""according to the surgeon general women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects.

fillers should not be thought of as a substitute for surgery. a patient who needs a face and neck lift will have sagginess around the jowls and jaw line and a hanging neck. none of that can be improved with fillers. while surgery may be appropriate to help tighten the mid and lower face it does that only to a limited degree. overaggressive surgical treatment will result in that terrible windblown overdrawn i-was-strapped-to-a-? look. and that result is very difficult to undo. as fillers are not a substitute for surgery the reverse is true as well. surgery cant take the place of fillers. but we need to be realistic about what non-surgical techniques such as fillers whether they be permanent or semi-permanent can do with respect to improving the entire appearance. remember the neck and the eyes are the areas that are the tipoffs to aging. and while fillers such as restylane juvederm hydrelle perlane zyderm zyplast cosmoderm cosmoplast sculptra radiesse and even fat and liquid silicone can do great things around the face and i certainly endorse them they dont answer the problem of the jowls the saggy neck the hanging platysma edges the double chin and upper neck and jaw fat. only surgery is the salvation there. experienced cosmetic plastic surgeons will guide you as to the best choices or combination of treatment. as ive said many a time one shoe does not fit all.,can fillers replace plastic surgery?,"['multivitamin', 'plastic surgery']",wmd
"most helpful answer as you know i have no way of seeing your throat taking a more detailed medical history or examining you over the internet. i can make a blind guess but a guess is not the same as a diagnostic opinion -- one that can only be accomplished by seeing a medical professional or ent specialist. you may want to look up ""tonsilliths"" (tonsil stones). these are common accumulations of food and other debris that can get trapped in or around the tonsillar areas. again don't diagnose yourself. see a medical professional for these matters. i cannot figure out how to reply on here so i am just going to post an answer to myself in hopes that you come back and check again. i had bloodwork done and they said that everything was fine. i did not diagnose myself with anything but i am fairly sure it is not tonsoliths because there are white spots on the back of my throat it looks like strep i am assuming but i had  tests done and all came back negative. i saw  ent's and i am seeing a third this coming monday. they all say tonsilitis but the er doctors said pharyngitis. i have been on  courses of antibiotics already however the thing is i smoke marijuana and i could not bring myself to quite while taking the antibiotics. having it for this long has caused me to quit the habit and i do not intend to go back because of the amount of work i had to put into just stopping for this very reason i don't want to go through that again. i don't know if smoking has caused a burn in the back of my throat and it itself may have got infected? because when i would smoke it would start to burn after awhile. again i have stopped and it has been  weeks to the day since i have quit. i started taking antibiotics again about  days ago. i do not see any sign of improvement could this be because i have built up a resistance to the antibiotics? i know this is not contagious because i have been by many people have gotten close enough to them where they would definitely catch it if it was contagious. does this help narrow anything down at all? just giving some other examples as to what this could be would just help put me at ease a little bit so i can stop wondering. thank you for taking the time to read all of this if you did.",i have white spots on the back of my throat for about  months now. my throat is not i repeat not sore. whats wrong? . i have had a throat infection which the doctors at the er diagnosed as pharyngitis. these white spots have been on the back of my throat for almost  months now and i am getting sick of them. my throat is not sore whatsoever. i have white spots on my tonsils as well. sometimes my tonsils i believe will get a little sharp pain but it goes away in seconds. the back of the sides of my throat look white and inflamed as well. i have been on  courses of antibiotics and none of them have worked.,"['throat', 'pharyngitis', 'tonsil', 'pain', 'antibiotic']",wmd

the term ringworm or ringworms refers to fungal infections that are on the surface of the skin. the name is derived from the early belief that the infection was due to a worm which it is not. ringworm is a fungal infection in the skin. nevertheless the name ringworm remains. some of these fungi produce round spots on the skin but many do not. on the other hand many round red spots on the skin are not due to a fungal infection. a physical examination of the affected skin evaluation of skin scrapings under the microscope and culture tests can help doctors make the appropriate distinctions. a proper diagnosis is essential to successful treatment. the medical term for ringworm is tinea. (tinea is the latin name for a growing worm. ) doctors add another word to indicate where the fungus is located. tinea capitis for instance refers to scalp ringworm tinea corporis to fungus of the body tinea pedis to fungus of the feet and so on. ringworm occurs in people of all ages but it is particularly common in children. ringworm is contagious and can be passed from person to person by contact with infected skin areas or by sharing combs and brushes other personal care items or clothing. it is also possible become infected with ringworm after coming in contact with locker room or pool surfaces. the infection can also affect dogs and cats who may transmit the infection to humans. it is common to have several areas of ringworm at once in different body areas.,what does the term ringworm mean?,['ringworm'],wmd

"once your doctor has ruled out other medical conditions he or she may prescribe fertility drugs to stimulate your ovulation. the drug contained in both clomid and serophene (clomiphene) is often a first choice because it's effective and has been prescribed to women for decades. unlike many infertility drugs it also has the advantage of being taken orally instead of by injection. it is used to induce ovulation and to correct irregular ovulation by increasing egg production by the ovaries. clomiphene induces ovulation in most women with anovulation. up to % of women who use clomiphene for infertility will have a multiple gestation pregnancy -- usually twins. (in comparison just % of the general population of women delivers twins. ) the typical starting dosage of clomphene is  milligrams per day for five days beginning on the third fourth or fifth day after your period begins. you can expect to start ovulating about seven days after you've taken the last dose of clomiphene. if you don't ovulate right away the dose can be increased by  milligrams per day each month up to  mg. after you've begun to ovulate most doctors suggest taking clomid for no longer than six months. if you haven't gotten pregnant by then you would try a different medication. these fertility drugs sometimes make the cervical mucus ""hostile"" to sperm keeping sperm from swimming into the uterus. this can be overcome by using artificial insemination -- injecting specially prepared sperm directly into the uterus -- to fertilize the egg. depending on your situation your doctor may also suggest other fertility drugs such as gonal-f or other injectable hormones that stimulate follicles and stimulate egg development in the ovaries. these are the so-called ""super-ovulation"" drugs. most of these drugs are administered by injection just under the skin. some of these hormones may overstimulate the ovaries (causing abdominal bloating and discomfort) thus your doctor will monitor you with frequent vaginal ultrasounds and blood tests to monitor estrogen levels. about % of women ovulate with these drugs and between % and % become pregnant.",how can i become pregnant if i have problems ovulating?,"['pregnancy', 'ovulation']",wmd

before you choose a health care provider for pregnancy the first question to ask is whether your pregnancy is likely to be normal and uncomplicated or complicated and high-risk? if you have high blood pressure diabetes or a history of previous pregnancy complications are younger than  or  and older you should seek care from a health care provider experienced in treating women with your type of medical condition such as an ob/gyn or perinatologist. if you are at low risk for complications your family practitioner or a nurse midwife may be right for you. once you decide the type of provider that best suits your needs you will need to select one person in particular. you may want to schedule an introductory visit to meet with the health care provider you are considering and determine if you feel comfortable with him or her. here are some questions to ask during your meeting. how long have you been in practice? when and where did you receive training? are you board-certified? do you have professional or patient references? have you had any problems with your medical practice? to get this information contact your state medical licensing board. what are your general philosophies about pregnancy labor and delivery? think about how they fit in with your own beliefs. how many babies do you deliver per week? how many children do you have? are you in a group practice? if so will i see every provider with whom you rotate during my doctor visits? do i have a choice about whom i see and who delivers my baby? note: if you choose a health care provider who belongs to a group practice usually all the members of the group will see you during your pregnancy and one of them will be there for the delivery. who will i see at each appointment? will you be in town around my due date? note that there are no guarantees that a specific health care provider will deliver your baby since no provider is available  hours a day; make sure you know the other providers in the practice or with whom the doctor shares delivery responsibility. if i have a question who do i call? who responds to the calls? do you accept questions via e-mail? am i allowed to write a personal birth plan? will it be respected? a personal birth plan is a written agreement between you and your doctor as to how your baby will be delivered. it gives the parents more of a role in the decision making process; however the plan is no guarantee that your birthing process will go as planned since complications can arise. if complications arise your doctor will make decisions based on your and your baby's safety. what is your policy on inducing labor if i go beyond my due date? another important thing to consider when selecting a health care provider is where you want to deliver. if you have a certain place in mind you need to make sure that person can deliver your baby there.,how do i choose a health care provider for pregnancy?,['pregnancy'],wmd

it's important to use an eye makeup remover that's specific for waterproof mascara. i am not a big fan of waterproof mascara for that very reason. i think it does coat the eyelashes a little too heavily and can be difficult to remove and sometimes the eyelashes can come out with it. fortunately the eyelash cycle is pretty quick so your hair will grow back very quickly over time really within a matter of a few weeks. but it's uncomfortable if you are using it over a long period of time to keep losing lashes like that. so i would try recommending a water-based mascara except for very special occasions when you really need something longer lasting. then if you have the waterproof mascara look for something that's very specific and take your time. let it sit on your lashes for a little bit longer and then rinse with lukewarm water and then repeat the process without rubbing because it's the rubbing that can physically remove the lashes.,i am losing eyelashes when i wear waterproof mascara. what can i use to clean my face that won't damage my eyelashes?,['injury'],wmd

hello. from your description here it seems you are troubled with the anger issues more than anything else. and the recurrence of the anger is probably a reason why you want to know if this could be bipolar disorder. however the symptoms you have described here are not sufficient to diagnose or rule out bipolar disorder. mood symptoms are prominent in bipolar disorder. usually there should be alternate periods of depression and mania/hypomania with intervening period of normal behavior and mood. there could even be two or more consecutive manic or depressive episodes. but the most important criteria is to have episodes of mania/hypomania and depression. anxiety also seems to play a major role in the emotional disturbances you might have. even without having a diagnosis for this you can start working towards improving the situation. ideally you should consult a psychiatrist for a better understanding of the situation. if that is not possible you can start with a few exercises for stress relief such as the jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation. as to the anger it is important to exercise rational thinking 'during' a situation that normally produces the anger. rational thinking can be viewed as a thinking pattern which allows you to reach your goals with minimum emotional disturbances. it needs practice and it can be learned with the help of a psychotherapist but you can certainly try it until you can manage to consult a doctor. hope this helps. abhijeet deshmukh md (this post is for the purpose of providing medical information and is not a substitute for a face-to-face consultation with a doctor. this post is not intended to give or rule out a diagnosis create a doctor-patient relationship or replace an existing one. i am not able to diagnose medical conditions online. please consult with your doctor or a qualified healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment options),i constantly have bursts of anger for no reason once it's over i usually wish i wouldn't have done it and go from being absolutely angry and freaking out to completely calm. my father is the same way i have constant anxiety and i'm almost never completely happy about something. my moods are all over the place but the most dominating and often reoccurring is anger i literally wake up in the morning angry for no reason. i was never like this before i hit about  i just turned  and it seems to be getting increasingly worse. it just feels like i'm someone else completely when it's happening an i just don't feel like i can stop no matter who i'm taking it out on then i snap out of it after it finally exhaust's me and it's just almost like it was a different person acting that way. i don't have the money to go to the doctor and i don't have insurance. i feel like i can't handle this emotional roller-coaster anymore. does this classify under bipolar and if so what type?,"['bipolar disorder', 'anxiety', 'bipolar', 'angry', 'anxiety bipolar disorder', 'about bipolar disorder', 'anxiety and bipolar disorder', 'anxiety disorder', 'anger disorder', 'anxiety anger', 'bipolar disorder']",eh

absolutely. i have dozens of teens on birth control who have never been sexually involved. hormonal regulation menstrual pain heavy/frequent periods. and even severe acne (also hormone-related) are some of the medical indications to use birth control pills. teens do have birth control access even without parent permission but when it is for a medical reason (and not contraception) parents should be involved. and supportive. really good question. the incidence of non-sexual teens is probably pretty low in this day and time. but yes god bless them it happens. i think you have to address the cramping first obviously. lots of possible causes. again i say you start at the most obvious cause and work your way back to the most obscure. with girls cramps are most commonly due to menes blood flowing thru the cervix clots hurt more. the cervix which is the distal end of the uterus which extends down into the vag is very sensitive to stuff going thru it dilating it. that's why clots hurt more than just thin blood. some doctors from my experience over the years have used bc pills to control blood flow down the uterus to the vag. i'm not a girl but i've been married twice and i have  daughters. one started her periods at age . very cruel joke from mother nature. both my wives had endometriosis and had bleeding problems. cramps were an everyday occurence. so was overflow bleeding. geez i felt so bad for my girls. nothing prepares a girl for that. gone are the days when girls cramps were written off by professionals as nerotic. i know it hurts. altho some girls tend to be drama queens who actually knows how bad it hurts except them? historically bc pills a cocktail of hormones i think seem to reduce blood loss. also affects weight gain. bigger boobs too. fluid retention. lovely. but my answer to your direct question is if it's bc pills then yes it could help with the cramps. and who knows or wants to know if they're sexually active? just put them on the pill. hope for the best. if it doesn't work with the cramps let them know they should tell you so you can seek other answers. parenting is tough especially with girls. this is my best answer. to be honest my cramps were much less severe (and sometimes i never even had cramps) while i was on birth control. however if you don't truly need birth control i would advise finding another method to control your cramping. think about what birth control is and what it does to your body. you are literally swallowing one tiny pill that completely changes the mechanics of your body. i don't know for sure what types of negative effects they have truly linked to birth control but it all just seems too much to be necessary. i don't take any pills if i do not have to to keep junk out of my body but when my cramps get horrible i have found advil liquigels work much better than midol and the like. there are also many natural alternatives that are simply an internet search away. birth control pills estrogen and progesterone are powerful and potentially dangerous drugs and should not be used for period cramping unless there is a clear need. these drugs have very severe side effects and should not be taken lightly. birth control pills can cause blood clots liver cancer gallbladder disease heart attacks acne oily scalp hair loss high blood pressure depression cataracts and many many other side effects. bcps should be reserved only for those that are in severe need of them. if you have severe cramping there are other things you can try: otc pain medications heating pad soak in a warm bath.,should non-sexually active teens have access to birth control especially when they have severe cramping? . many teens often have severe cramping or other symptoms that are really hard to push through. sometimes it can hold one's self back from doing many daily things even walking. would you consider birth control an effective way of reducing the pain when just applying heat and taking midol or pamprin just isn't enough? just because teens may need birth control does not always mean the want to be sexually active and some have a hard time telling their parents that. think of the health benefits.,"['birth control', 'pain', 'walking']",wmd

crohn's disease causes inflammation in the small intestine. crohn's disease usually occurs in the lower part of the small intestine called the ileum but it can affect any part of the digestive tract from the mouth to the anus. the inflammation extends deep into the lining of the affected organ. the inflammation can cause pain and can make the intestines empty frequently resulting in diarrhea. crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) the general name for diseases that cause inflammation in the intestines. crohn's disease can be difficult to diagnose because its symptoms are similar to other intestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome and to another type of ibd called ulcerative colitis. ulcerative colitis causes inflammation and ulcers in the top layer of the lining of the large intestine. crohn's disease affects men and women equally and seems to run in some families. about  percent of people with crohn's disease have a blood relative with some form of ibd most often a brother or sister and sometimes a parent or child. crohn's disease may also be called ileitis or enteritis.,what is crohn's disease?,"[""crohn's disease""]",wmd

the american heart association recommends eating fish at least two times per week of .  ounce servings. oily fish such as salmon mackerel herring lake trout and albacore tuna are the highest in omega- fatty acids. if you don't like fish or are unable to consume it that often then supplementation with fish oil makes sense. check with your healthcare provider to determine appropriate amounts. another supplement you may want to consider is vitamin d as low levels are linked to an increased risk of heart disease. i recommend getting a blood test to determine your blood levels. your doctor can help recommend the amount you need to get your levels to normal. most people don't get enough vitamin d because the main source is the sun. a multivitamin may be appropriate if your diet is inadequate but there is no evidence that they help prevent heart disease -- a healthy diet is much more important. while supplementation makes sense in some cases this article points to lifestyle changes you can make to significantly decrease your risk. good luck!,what supplements can i take to help with heart disease? is krill omega  any good? family history with heart disease.,['heart disease'],wmd
shortness of breath is an early symptom seen in congestive heart failure patients. swollen ankles and feet is a more serious symptom and may be evidenced by swollen extremities (especially the ankles) and by weight gain. i have known some congestive heart failure victims to gain as much as fifteen pounds in one day. one individual in particular stands out in my mind. she was much younger than  years old and took lasix (diuretic) every day to release excess fluid. when swollen extremities and weight gain of at least seven pounds occurred metolazone (known as the turbo pill) was added to the daily regimen for a very short period of time until the acute water build up was under control. although gaining six pounds of weight in two weeks is not in itself a medical crisis it is a sign of fluid retention and justifies being assessed in person by a physician. being  years old with overt congestive heart failure symptoms puts this person in a potentially life threatening situation. despite the upsetting emotions that a trip to the e. r. may evoke in this person it is better to be safe than sorry. i suggest that you phone her physician first and then take this person to the hospital for treatment. best wishes for this lady's speedy recovery.,swollen feet and shortness of breath are new symptoms of a  yr old who has congestive heart failure. however her oxygen levels are %. she has gained  pds over the last two weeks and has difficulty eating. we were advised by her physician to observe her (she has a pending appt nxt wk) and she has been taken her medication regularly and has strictly followed her diet. . should this warrant a visit to the e/r? i am trying to avoid additional stress on her since she has alzheimer's and dementia and the goings to the hospital get her confused and she comes back home more fragile than ever.,"['foot', 'congestive heart failure', 'oxygen', 'diet', 'stress']",wmd

oral rehydration solutions are liquids that contain a carbohydrate (glucose or rice syrup) and electrolyte (sodium potassium chloride and citrate or bicarbonate). originally the world health organization developed the who-ors to rapidly rehydrate victims of the severe diarrheal illness cholera. the who-ors solution contains glucose and electrolytes. the glucose in the solution is important because it forces the small intestine to quickly absorb the fluid and the electrolytes. the purpose of the electrolytes in the solution is the prevention and treatment of electrolyte deficiencies. in the united states convenient premixed commercial ors products that are similar to the who-ors are available for rehydration and prevention of dehydration. examples of these products are pedialyte rehydralyte infalyte and resol. most of the commercially available ors products in the u. s. contain glucose. infalyte is the only one that contains rice carbohydrate instead of glucose. most doctors believe that there are no important differences in effectiveness between glucose and rice carbohydrate. infants and young children. most acute diarrhea in infants and young children is due to viral gastroenteritis and is usually short-lived. antibiotics are not routinely prescribed for viral gastroenteritis. however fever vomiting and loose stools can be symptoms of other childhood infections such as otitis media (infection of the middle ear) pneumonia bladder infection sepsis (bacterial infection in the blood) and meningitis. these illnesses may require early antibiotic treatment. infants with acute diarrhea also can quickly become severely dehydrated and therefore need early rehydration. for these reasons sick infants with diarrhea should be evaluated by their pediatricians to identify and treat underlying infections as well as to provide instructions on the proper use of oral rehydration products. infants with moderate-to-severe dehydration usually are treated with intravenous fluids in the hospital. the pediatrician may decide to treat infants who are mildly dehydrated due to viral gastroenteritis at home with ors. infants that are breast-fed or formula-fed should continue to receive breast milk during the rehydration phase of their illness if not prevented by vomiting. during and for a short time after recovering from viral gastroenteritis babies can be lactose intolerant due to a temporary deficiency of the enzyme lactase (necessary to digest the lactose in milk) in the small intestine. patients with lactose intolerance can develop worsening diarrhea and cramps when dairy products are introduced. therefore after rehydration with ors an undiluted lactose-free formula and diluted juices are recommended. milk products can be gradually increased as the baby improves. older children and adults. during mild cases of diarrhea diluted fruit juices soft drinks containing sugar sports drinks such as gatorade and water can be used to prevent dehydration. caffeine and lactose containing dairy products should be temporarily avoided since they can aggravate diarrhea the latter primarily in individuals with transient lactose intolerance. if there is no nausea and vomiting solid foods should be continued. foods that usually are well tolerated during a diarrheal illness include rice cereal bananas potatoes and lactose-free products. ors can be used for moderately severe diarrhea that is accompanied by dehydration in children older than  years of age and in adults. these solutions are given at  ml/kg over four to six hours for mild dehydration or  ml/kg over six hours for moderate dehydration. after rehydration the ors solution can be used to maintain hydration at  ml to  ml/kg over  hours until the diarrhea stops. directions on the solution label usually state the amounts that are appropriate. after rehydration older children and adults should resume solid food as soon as any nausea and vomiting subside. solid food should begin with rice cereal bananas potatoes and lactose-free and low-fat products. the variety of foods can be expanded as the diarrhea subsides.,how can dehydration from diarrhea be prevented and treated?,"['dehydration', 'diarrhea']",wmd

prevacid or lansoprazole has recently moved from prescription strength to over-the-counter. the over-the-counter dose is labeled for adults  and older. this medication is intended to treat stomach ulcers or heartburn that occurs  or more times per week. it is not a quick fix to elevate symptoms for heartburn. it slows the production of acid within the stomach over a period of time and is taken daily for  days. we recommend seeking medical advice if the product needs to be taken for more than  days. i would not give prevacid to your -year-old child. while this product is found over the counter it still must be used according to its labeled directions in order to be safe and effective. if your child is having constant heartburn or stomach issues seek medical advice from your pediatrician. consider looking at the cause of the symptoms to help educate your child. for instance eating slower avoiding certain foods that trigger symptoms or eating smaller portions may help his/her symptoms. while medications are readily available and sometimes seem to be the quick fix look at preventing the symptoms by changing behaviors.,can my -year-old take over-the-counter prevacid?,['over the counter'],wmd

after an outbreak of chickenpox usually in childhood the virus that causes it stays in your body lying dormant in certain nerve cells. although your immune system usually keeps the virus in check anything that affects the immune system's ability to hold back the virus -- illnesses immunosuppressive drugs severe stress or aging-related changes for example -- can allow the virus to return with a vengeance. early symptoms of shingles include burning or shooting pain and tingling or itching generally on one side of the body or face. for some people the pain is severe. it may be accompanied by fever chills nausea diarrhea and difficulty urinating. the pain and tingling are followed by a rash which begins with reddish bumps most often on the trunk. in a few days the bumps become fluid-filled blisters which usually crust over and fall off after seven to  days. even when the rash goes away the skin color at the rash site may be different. also nerve pain may persist at the site of the rash (a condition called postherpetic neuralgia). about one-fifth of people who get shingles develop postherpetic neuralgia. in most people the pain goes away within four months from the first sign of the rash. shingles is typically easy to diagnose. your health care provider will suspect shingles if you exhibit the typical symptoms of rash on one side of the body along with sharp burning pain and a history of chickenpox.,what are the symptoms of shingles and how is it diagnosed?,['shingles'],wmd
a transient ischemic attack should be considered a major warning sign of an impending future stroke. up to % of people will experience a stroke within three months of a tia. since there is no way of predicting whether the next episode will resolve the patient needs to be educated that should symptoms occur they need to access medical care immediately. activating the emergency medical services system and calling  is recommended. if a stroke occurs there is a very short period of time where thrombolytic (clot dissolving) drugs  can be used to reverse a stroke. in most hospitals the drug can only be given within three hours of onset of stroke symptoms. in that three hours the patient needs to get to the hospital the diagnosis needs to be made laboratory tests and head ct scans need to be performed neurologic consultation needs to occur and the drug administered. the longer the delay the higher the risk that the drug won't work and that complications like bleeding into the brain will occur. specialized interventional radiologists can inject tpa directly into the clot that has blocked the blood vessel in the brain. this can extend the time frame to six hours but currently this treatment is not widely available. tias should be considered the equivalent of angina of the brain. in heart disease angina is the heart pain that warns of potential heart attack. when heart muscle is damaged it cannot be replaced or repaired. similarly brain tissue is at risk when there is decreased blood supply and it too cannot be replaced.,what is the prognosis for transient ischemic attack or tia?,"['transient ischemia attack', 'transient ischemic attack']",wmd

"no one knows the exact causes of brain tumors. doctors can seldom explain why one person develops a brain tumor and another does not. however it is clear that brain tumors are not contagious. no one can ""catch"" the disease from another person. research has shown that people with certain risk factors are more likely than others to develop a brain tumor. a risk factor is anything that increases a person's chance of developing a disease. the following risk factors are associated with an increased chance of developing a primary brain tumor: being male -- in general brain tumors are more common in males than females. however meningiomas are more common in females. race -- brain tumors occur more often among white people than among people of other races. age -- most brain tumors are detected in people who are  years old or older. however brain tumors are the second most common cancer in children. (leukemia is the most common childhood cancer. ) brain tumors are more common in children younger than  years old than in older children. family history -- people with family members who have gliomas may be more likely to develop this disease. being exposed to radiation or certain chemicals at work: radiation -- workers in the nuclear industry have an increased risk of developing a brain tumor. formaldehyde -- pathologists and embalmers who work with formaldehyde have an increased risk of developing brain cancer. scientists have not found an increased risk of brain cancer among other types of workers exposed to formaldehyde. vinyl chloride -- workers who make plastics may be exposed to vinyl chloride. this chemical may increase the risk of brain tumors. acrylonitrile -- people who make textiles and plastics may be exposed to acrylonitrile. this exposure may increase the risk of brain cancer. scientists are investigating whether cell phones may cause brain tumors. studies thus far have not found an increased risk of brain tumors among people who use cell phones. scientists also continue to study whether head injuries are a risk factor for brain tumors. so far these studies have not found an increased risk among people who have had head injuries. most people who have known risk factors do not get brain cancer. on the other hand many who do get the disease have none of these risk factors. people who think they may be at risk should discuss this concern with their doctor. the doctor may be able to suggest ways to reduce the risk and can plan an appropriate schedule for checkups.",what causes and who is at risk for brain tumors?,['brain tumor'],wmd

after you are infected with hepatitis c you enter an early shorter-term (acute) stage of the disease. some people with acute hepatitis c fight off the virus permanently and never have any liver problems. but up to % of people who are infected with the virus will go on to develop long-term (chronic) hepatitis c.  long-term infection with hepatitis c often causes tiny scars to gradually form in your liver. if you develop a lot of these scars it becomes hard for your liver to work well. about % of people who develop chronic hepatitis c eventually develop more serious liver problems such as cirrhosis or liver cancer usually over a period of  or more years.  acute phase most people have no symptoms immediately after they have been infected with hepatitis c. if you do not feel any different than normal you probably will not know that you have hepatitis c. even if you go to your doctor because of symptoms your symptoms may be blamed on the flu. since any symptoms are likely to go away in a few weeks you may not know you have hepatitis c for a long time. if you have an obvious symptom of hepatitis c such as jaundice or if you know you have been exposed to the blood of someone with hepatitis c then you should go to your doctor to be tested for a hepatitis c virus infection. chronic phase you will be diagnosed with chronic (long-term) hepatitis c if your liver has shown signs of infection for at least  months. if you have a chronic infection you will probably have some liver inflammation even if you do not have symptoms. a chronic infection can last for many years and may never go away. some people who have chronic hepatitis c never have serious liver problems. other people develop severe liver problems such as cirrhosis liver cancer or liver failure usually over a period of  years or longer. if the infection becomes so severe that your liver can no longer function (end-stage liver failure ) having a liver transplant may be the only way to extend your life. hepatitis c mostly causes damage to the liver. sometimes it also plays a role in other health problems. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,what happens to someone when they get hepatitis c?,['hepatitis c'],wmd

this is a great question because actually the two drugs mentioned wellbutrin and geodon actually can cause some weight gain. so i would actually ask this patient number one are they telling their doctors that they -- they may be seeing two different doctors are they aware that they are taking these medications and do they have a medication list. because of the side effect profile we are adding a medication that we really probably don't need. i would like to be able to find a more non-drug option such as changing their diet increasing their fluid intake. so we want to make sure that that patient understands that. the pharmacist by looking at their medication list when they are coming to visit the pharmacy will be able to point that out and say hey you are getting an unnecessary medication for side effect of two drugs and maybe one of them they may not necessarily need. so that's where the pharmacist can actually contact the physicians or healthcare provider and say doctor are you aware of this? this happens all the time in the pharmacy. i can't tell you how many times i say to patients does your doctor know? well i went to this doctor for this medicine but this doctor doesn't know about this one. everyone needs to know about it. that's why that medication list is so important. not only is it help the pharmacist but bring it to all your other doctor appointments. that way they can see everything that everyone is prescribing and we can avoid medication errors and unnecessary use.,do diet pills interact with depression and bipolar meds such as wellbutrin and geodon?,"['depression', 'bipolar disorder', 'diet pills', 'drug']",wmd

dry skin is a frustrating condition and winter makes it even worse. if you have a moisturizer that does not burn then you should stick with that. here are a few more dry skin tips for winter: * take warm showers not hot. when possible rinse in cooler water. this helps your skin to not over-respond to the hot water by becoming more dry and red. * after showering washing your face or hands be sure to dry your skin completely with a dry towel. i'm not sure why this is but we tend to only partially dry our hands during the winter and this will contribute to the development of really dry skin that is prone to cracking and breaking. * use a humidifier in your room. winter air is dry and your skin suffers from this. raising the humidity in your home will help your overall symptoms. * obviously you want to stay well hydrated so drink plenty of water and water-containing beverages eat fruit and vegetables. stay away from caffeine and alcohol because they dehydrate you.,last winter my skin started to get excessively dry and crack overnight. this year it's back. what can i do?,['skin'],wmd

the -minute suggestion is based on the national academy of science's recommendation for people who are trying to prevent weight gain or keep themselves from regaining after weight loss -- not for people who are trying to increase or maintain their cardio-respiratory fitness or health. there's plenty of research to show that  minutes of physical activity a day will help you gain lots of health and fitness benefits. remember that you don't have to do all your exercise in one session. if you already exercise vigorously at the gym several times a week there's no reason to quit. but if  minutes seems like too much for you try  minutes a day as a starting goal. the most important thing is that you do something. do what you can! its still beneficial for you to do as much exercise as you can even if youre not meeting the recommended amount. keep in mind that you can break up your physical activity into as little as  minute sessions throughout the day which may be more mindful of your time constraints. build more physical activity into your daily routine naturally by parking further away taking the stairs instead of the elevator or using a break room or restroom on an opposite side of the building or on a different floor at work. consider finding a different mode of transportation to work or while running errands. you may live close enough to be able to walk or bike to some of the places that you need to go. if you take the bus try getting off at an earlier stop and walking a bit more. find ways to be active with your family like going for a walk or bike ride and set up a regular routine with it. fit in exercise while youre watching tv by doing body weight exercises during commercials or use exercise equipment like a treadmill elliptical or stationary bike that you may have at home to do activity while you watch your shows. lastly write down your entire weekly schedule. this can help you to better visualize your schedule so that you can better see opportunities where you can incorporate more physical activity or perhaps you can move things around to create an opening for exercise. you may not be able to meet a recommended amount but do what you can!,what if i dont have time to exercise  minutes a day?,['exercise'],wmd

"well to be honest this is a question that can only be answered by your doctor. there are so many factors that go into whether or not a hernia requires surgery that it's a highly individualized situation. ' hernia ' is a term that refers to a condition in which fatty tissue or organs protrude through a weak spot in the muscles of the abdomen. in men especially there is a naturally weak spot in the groin where the spermatic cord passes from the scrotum into the abdomen. because of the natural muscle weakness in this area men are at risk of inadvertently pushing organs (often the bowel wall) into the inguinal canal through heavy lifting contact sports and other activities that place a lot of stress on that area. as you pointed out many small hernias do not require treatment but this depends on where the hernia is located and how severe it is. if your doctor recommends surgery you should listen carefully. even a small hernia can require repair if it involves a piece of bowel or bladder tissue. tissue trapped in a hernia can die and this can have severe health consequences. so don't think just because a doctor referred to a hernia as ""small"" that this alone determines whether or not it requires treatment. in the meantime you might ask your doctor if you should avoid heavy lifting or contact sports as these can make the hernia worse. wishing you well!",can dissovable thread and mesh be used for surgery of a small hernia and is it possible i don't need surgery. my doc said he found  small hernias in the groin and i read online that small hernias don't need surgery because sometimes they never grow or cause pain.?,"['surgery', 'hernia', 'pain']",wmd

gastroesophageal reflux disease commonly referred to as gerd or acid reflux is a condition in which the liquid content of the stomach regurgitates (backs up or refluxes) into the esophagus. the liquid can inflame and damage the lining (cause esophagitis) of the esophagus although visible signs of inflammation occur in a minority of patients. the regurgitated liquid usually contains acid and pepsin that are produced by the stomach. (pepsin is an enzyme that begins the digestion of proteins in the stomach. ) the refluxed liquid also may contain bile that has backed-up into the stomach from the duodenum. (the duodenum is the first part of the small intestine that attaches to the stomach. ) acid is believed to be the most injurious component of the refluxed liquid. pepsin and bile also may injure the esophagus but their role in the production of esophageal inflammation and damage is not as clear as the role of acid. gerd is a chronic condition. once it begins it usually is lifelong. if there is injury to the lining of the esophagus (esophagitis) this also is a chronic condition. moreover after the esophagus has healed with treatment and treatment is stopped the injury will return in most patients within a few months. once treatment for gerd is begun therefore it usually will need to be continued indefinitely although it is argued that in some patients with intermittent symptoms and no esophagitis treatment can be intermittent and done only during symptomatic periods. in fact the reflux of the stomach's liquid contents into the esophagus occurs in most normal individuals. one study found that reflux occurs as frequently in normal individuals as in patients with gerd. in patients with gerd however the refluxed liquid contains acid more often and the acid remains in the esophagus longer. it has also been found that liquid refluxes to a higher level in the esophagus in patients with gerd than normal individuals. as is often the case the body has ways (mechanisms) to protect itself from the harmful effects of reflux and acid. for example most reflux occurs during the day when individuals are upright. in the upright position the refluxed liquid is more likely to flow back down into the stomach due to the effect of gravity. in addition while individuals are awake they repeatedly swallow whether or not there is reflux. each swallow carries any refluxed liquid back into the stomach. finally the salivary glands in the mouth produce saliva which contains bicarbonate. with each swallow bicarbonate-containing saliva travels down the esophagus. the bicarbonate neutralizes the small amount of acid that remains in the esophagus after gravity and swallowing have removed most of the liquid. gravity swallowing and saliva are important protective mechanisms for the esophagus but they are effective only when individuals are in the upright position. at night during sleep gravity is not in effect swallowing stops and the secretion of saliva is reduced. therefore reflux that occurs at night is more likely to result in acid remaining in the esophagus longer and causing greater damage to the esophagus. certain conditions make a person susceptible to gerd. for example gerd can be a serious problem during pregnancy. the elevated hormone levels of pregnancy probably cause reflux by lowering the pressure in the lower esophageal sphincter. at the same time the growing fetus increases the pressure in the abdomen. both of these effects would be expected to increase reflux. also patients with diseases that weaken the esophageal muscles such as scleroderma or mixed connective tissue diseases are more prone to develop gerd.,what is acid reflux also known as gerd?,['heartburn'],wmd

before using any over the counter medication diabetics should first discuss with their doctor whether the medication is safe and appropriate. a common medication used for runny noses is a decongestant. decongestants are available either as a pill or as a nasal spray. common decongestants found in pill form include pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine. both of these ingredients may raise blood glucose and blood pressure levels. people with diabetes should only use decongestants cautiously and under the direction of a doctor. because of its misuse and side effects pseudoephedrine is found behind the pharmacy counter. this measure means that pharmacists can make sure that pseudoephedrine is being used appropriately. phenylephrine may be found on the store shelves. remember that many cold medications contain multiple ingredients. be sure to read carefully all the ingredients in a preparation. many cold preparations contain non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) such as ibuprofen (advil) or naproxen (aleve). these agents can be harmful to the kidneys of diabetics and if pain is not an issue may not be needed. therefore buying separate ingredients rather than a combination medication may be safer. a nasal decongestant works more quickly than a decongestant taken by mouth. this preparation is sprayed into each nostril. nasal decongestants usually do not have a significant effect on blood glucose or blood pressure levels because their effect is mainly local. however if used excessively they can have effects on glucose and blood pressure. the important downside to nasal decongestants is a possible rebound effect that makes your nose even more congested if you use them for more than  to  days. for that reason they are best for short-lived colds and not for persistent allergies. saline nasal sprays are safe for diabetics and do no affect blood glucose levels. nasal strips are another good option and are available over the counter. the strips work by mechanically opening the nostrils. antihistamines are a commonly used for a runny nose. antihistamines can help dry a runny nose due to an allergy but are not helpful for a runny nose due to the common cold. antihistamines do not raise blood glucose levels and are usually safe for diabetics. however some of the older over-the counter antihistamines cause sleepiness. this can be a real problem in diabetics especially when combined with sedatives or alcohol. diphenhydramine (benadryl) is an antihistamine that causes sleepiness but fexofenadine (allegra) loratadine (claritin) and cetirizine (zyrtec) are less sedating. the most important step though in treating your symptoms is to be sure you have the correct diagnosis. go over your symptoms and signs with your doctor. many times what seems to be an allergy may in fact be a bacterial sinus infection. bacterial sinus infections are common in diabetics and need to be treated with antibiotics which are only available by prescription. so dont rush out and buy an over-the-counter preparation without first talking with your provider.,can a type  diabetic use over the counter sinus and allergy medicine?,"['diabetes', 'sinus', 'over the counter']",wmd

"i think it would be helpful to understand exactly what anemia is. anemia is the medical term for the inability of red blood cells to transport oxygen molecules to the tissues of the body. anemia can be caused by either a lack of red blood cells (such as from excessive bleeding) or from a lack of hemoglobin (a protein on red blood cells that enables them to transport oxygen). when a person has anemia their organs muscles nerves and other tissues are not receiving enough oxygen to function well. usually a person with anemia feels very ""run down. "" many people experience episodes of mild to moderate anemia due to temporary situations like heavy menstrual bleeding. because this type of anemia is caused by some sort of brief episode that brings about the condition the body often can rebound by producing additional red blood cells to correct the problem. sometimes however anemia is caused by a long-term medical condition that doesn't allow the body to ""catch up"" its red blood cell production. an example of this type of anemia is sickle cell anemia. this inherited disorder causes many red blood cells to be malformed and unable to transport oxygen. this is not a situation the body can correct by making more cells. so to answer your question untreated anemia can have a serious impact on a person's health depending on the cause. if a person has a chronic anemia they could actually die from the disease. and that would be a shame because most anemias can be managed with medications and supplements. if you have anemia or know someone you think may have it i suggest you visit a health care practitioner for a simple blood test and treatment. wishing you well!",what happens when you don't treat anemia?,['anemia'],wmd

absorbents. absorbents are compounds that absorb water. absorbents that are taken orally bind water in the small intestine and colon and make diarrheal stools less watery. the two main absorbents are attapulgite and polycarbophil and they are both available without prescriptions. examples of products containing attapulgite are: donnagel. rheaban. kaopectate advanced formula. parepectolin. diasorb. examples of products containing polycarbophil are: equalactin. konsyl fiber. mitrolan. polycarb. one concern is that absorbents also can bind medications and interfere with their absorption into the body. for this reason it often is recommended that medications and absorbents be taken several hours apart so that they are physically separated within the intestine. antimotility medications. antimotility medications are drugs that relax the muscles of the small intestine and/or the colon. relaxation results in slower flow of intestinal contents. cramps due to spasm of the intestinal muscles also are relieved by the muscular relaxation. the two main antimotility medications are loperamide (imodium) which is available without a prescription and diphenoxylate (lomotil) which requires a prescription. both medications are related to opiates (for example codeine) but neither has the pain-relieving effects of opiates. diphenoxylate is a man-made medication that at high doses can be addictive because of its opiate-like euphoric (mood-elevating) effects. in order to prevent abuse of diphenoxylate and addiction a second medication atropine is added to loperamide in lomotil. if too much lomotil is ingested unpleasant side effects from too much atropine will occur. loperamide and diphenoxylate are safe and well-tolerated. there are some precautions however that should be observed. antimotility medications should not be used without a doctor's guidance to treat diarrhea caused by moderate or severe ulcerative colitis c. difficile colitis and intestinal infections by bacteria that invade the intestine (for example shigella ). their use can lead to more serious inflammation and prolong the infections. diphenoxylate can cause drowsiness or dizziness and caution should be used if driving or performing tasks that require alertness and coordination. antimotility medications should not be used in children younger than  years of age. acute diarrhea should improve within  hours. if symptoms do not improve or if they worsen a doctor should be consulted before continuing treatment with antimotility medications. bismuth compounds. many bismuth-containing preparations are available around the world. bismuth subsalicylate (pepto-bismol) is available in the united states. it contains two potentially active ingredients bismuth and salicylate (aspirin). pepto-bismol is well-tolerated. minor side effects include darkening of the stool and tongue. there are several precautions that should be observed when using pepto-bismol. patients who are allergic to aspirin should not take pepto-bismol. pepto-bismol should not be used with other aspirin-containing medications since too much aspirin may be ingested and lead to aspirin toxicity. the aspirin in pepto-bismol can accentuate the effects of anticoagulants particularly warfarin (coumadin) and lead to excessive bleeding. it also may cause abnormal bleeding in people who have a tendency to bleed because of genetic disorders or underlying diseases. the aspirin in pepto-bismol can aggravate stomach and duodenal ulcer disease. pepto-bismol and aspirin-containing products should not be given to children and teenagers with chickenpox influenza and other viral infections because they may cause reye's syndrome. reye's syndrome is a serious illness affecting primarily the liver and brain that can lead to liver failure and coma with a mortality rate of at least %. pepto-bismol should not be given to infants and children younger than  years of age.,how is diarrhea treated?,['diarrhea'],wmd

actually there are many causes of decreased vision and itching for which you need to rub your eyes. please answer a few questions. since how long you are using glasses? when you had your last refraction? do you have any eye allergy itching watering or redness that get worse in specific season? is this problem persist all day or it is more in the morning or evening? have you got an eye examination or using any drops currently? so from the complaints you described there may be just a change in refraction. if your refraction (glass number) is changing again and again then you might need to get a full eye examination and a few investigations. in cases with repeated change in refraction quickly there are chances of a condition called keratoconus in which shape of the cornea becomes conical and gets thin. at your age the cause of excessive rubbing may be allergic conjunctivitis called vernal keratoconjunctivitis (conjunctivitis due to some seasonal allergy). keratoconus is more common in people who have vernal keratoconjunctivitis. other causes may some congenital corneal dystrophy in which superficial corneal layers are peeled off with mild rubbing and cause blurred vision. so i would advise you to get a complete eye examination and your eye doctor can order some investigations like corneal topography if needed. then further management will depend on the eye examination. revert back with the answers to the above questions to an eye care ophthalmologist online --> <link>,what can be the reason for blurry image itchy eyes and headache?,['eye examination'],ic
when you swallow food passes down your throat and through your esophagus to your stomach. a muscle called the lower esophageal sphincter controls the opening between the esophagus and the stomach and remains tightly closed except when you swallow food. when this muscle fails to close the acid-containing contents of the stomach can splash back up into the esophagus. this backward movement is called reflux. when stomach acid enters the lower part of the esophagus it can produce a burning sensation commonly referred to as heartburn. gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) occurs when reflux is frequent enough to affect your daily life and/or damage your esophagus.,what is gastroesophageal reflux disease?,['heartburn'],wmd

"hyperthyroidism can be suspected in patients with tremors; excessive sweating; smooth velvety skin; fine hair; a rapid heart rate; and an enlarged thyroid gland. there may be puffiness around the eyes and a characteristic stare due to the elevation of the upper eyelids. advanced symptoms are easily detected but early symptoms especially in the elderly may be quite inconspicuous. in all cases a blood test is needed to confirm the diagnosis. the blood levels of thyroid hormones can be measured directly and are usually elevated with this disease. however the main tool for detection of hyperthyroidism is measurement of the blood thyroid stimulating hormone level. tsh is secreted by the pituitary gland. if an excess amount of thyroid hormone is present tsh is ""down-regulated"" and the level of tsh falls in an attempt to control thyroid hormone production. thus the measurement of tsh should result in low or undetectable levels in cases of hyperthyroidism. however there is one exception. if the excessive amount of thyroid hormone is actually due to a tsh-secreting pituitary tumor then the levels are abnormally high. this uncommon disease is known as ""secondary hyperthyroidism.

there are problems with the fat burning option on the cardio machines and it really ought to be eliminated. the idea behind the fat-burning option is this: because fat is denser than carbohydrate it requires more oxygen to burn. so to maximize the percentage of fat you burn compared to carbohydrate the fat-burning mode would have you work out at a pace at which your body can deliver lots of oxygen to your muscles. that generally means a slow pace to keep you from getting breathless. the problem is that when you exercise at a slower speed you burn fewer total calories -- from both carbohydrate and fat -- because you simply don't do as much work. further the way to get aerobically fit is to get your heart rate into the training range (usually % to % of your maximum heart rate) which is hard to do at slower speeds. and fitness is ultimately what you're after whether your goals are better health burning calories or improving heart and lung capacity. the bottom line is that the fat-burning mode probably won't be intense enough to maximize total calorie- or fat-burning or to help you increase or maintain optimum fitness levels. use the cardio mode to maximize your exercise benefits. using the fat burning mode on exercise machines at the gym actually isnt the best way to burn fat. the key concepts to understand here are the percentage of calories that come from fat and total calories. the fat burning mode is typically set at lower exercise intensity where more calories burned come from fat. not as many calories burned during higher exercise intensity will come from fat. the point to understand though is that while more of the calories that you burn will come from fat at a lower exercise intensity you have the potential to burn more calories per session doing higher exercise intensity. the percentage of calories burned from fat will be lower during the higher exercise intensity but you will be burning more calories overall including the amount of calories from fat. also higher exercise intensity leads to a greater boost in metabolism even after youre done exercising which burns additional calories. its best to do exercise that youre comfortable with and that meets your level of training/conditioning. in general however increasing the time spent on exercise and increasing exercise intensity will provide a greater potential to burn more calories and lose weight.,what's the difference between the fat-burning mode and the cardio mode on the machines at the gym?,['burn'],wmd

let me see if i can clear up some confusion here. the warfarin doesn't have anything to do with the titanium. warfarin is an anticoagulant medication used to prevent the blood from clotting easily. after a person has heart valve surgery he or she is at a higher risk for developing life-threatening blood clots. people who have heart valve replacement surgery -- whether the new valve is made of titanium or not -- take an anticoagulant for the rest of their lives to reduce their risk of developing a blood clot. when a metal plate is used to hold the bones of the eye socket together after a fracture there is no affect on blood circulation. therefore the patient does not need to take an anticoagulant. it doesn't matter if the plate is made of titanium or something else. i hope that clears things up for you. wishing you well! ok thanks but my next question then is how come recipients of bovine or porcine valves are on warfarin just for a few months only after valve replacement and not required to take it for the rest of their lives yet mechanical heart valve recipients need to be on warfarin i know it's for the anti clogging factor but why one and not the other my dad has a bovine and my husband has titanium valve respectively thanks in advance.,if warfarin needed for titanium heart valve then why is warfarin not used when one has titanium plate around eye socket,"['heart valve', 'eye socket']",wmd
hi this is from babycentre this should cover most of what you want to know? : what can i do if i want to get pregnant? if you want to get pregnant you may be offered the following treatments: the fertility drug clomifene is usually the first step as it can stimulate ovulation. if it doesn't work then you may be offered gonadotrophins. however gonadotrophins are more likely to overstimulate your ovaries and cause you to have a multiple pregnancy. if you are obese or resistant to clomifene the diabetes drug metformin may help. it increases your body's sensitivity to insulin so your insulin and your testosterone levels fall. this helps your body to ovulate normally. this is a controversial treatment as the benefits may not outweigh the risks. it has unpleasant side effects such as nausea and vomiting but may help if used in combination with clomifene. surgery on your ovaries. a technique called laparoscopic ovarian drilling (lod) can help some women to conceive if clomifene hasn't worked for them. lod is an effective lower risk alternative to gonadotrophins. lod destroys the tissue on the ovaries that is producing testosterone. the effects may not last but can improve the hormone imbalance long enough for you to conceive. if you are overweight your doctor is likely to ask you to reach a healthy bmi before trying fertility drugs or treatments. even if you lose a little weight it can help your insulin levels get nearer to normal and get ovulation going again if it has stopped. <link># do hope this helps you for getting pregnant. good luck,how to get pregnant with pcos. have just been diagnosed with pcos and desperately want a child. what are my treatment options.,['pregnancy'],wmd

whenever you have significant physical trauma that results in an injury inflammation will occur on the site where the most impact occurred. when inflammation happens some people will develop a low grade (.  oral temperature) fever due to the body working hard to heal itself. sweating could be contributed to such a fever as you are warmer than usual. as for the chest pain it could be associated with his arm being hurt but it depends on how he fell how far he fell and exactly how he landed. he could have injured more than originally thought. for temporary relief he should try r. i. c. e. (rest ice compression elevation) and perhaps some ibuprofen (motrin advil) to reduce swelling/pain/fever. acetaminophine (tylenol) should be fine as well if that works better for him but it doesn't have an anti-inflammatory component like ibuprofen does. ultimately the best thing to do is to see a physician just to be certain that everything is alright and there isn't something more serious occurring. most urgent care facilities will see you same day with or without insurance. emergency departments will as well but they are usually more congested and expensive. i hope this helps. best of luck to you!,"can a broken bone or a muscle tear cause a fever? . my father fell a month ago and has been experiencing pain in the arm he fell on. he won't go to a doctor because he does not have insurance. just this week he said he had a sweating spell and has been feeling ""under the weather"" for a few days. no other symptoms then he thinks he had a fever and even muscles in chest ache. so i am not sure if he just caught some virus or if maybe something from his fell is trying to tell his body.","['broken bone', 'muscle', 'fever', 'pain', 'arm']",wmd

i assume by insurance costs you are talking about patients spending on medical care in the form of deductibles copayments and coinsurance. for most people the answer is no. the health reform law requires that insurers pay the full cost of a wide range of preventive services including cancer screenings immunizations and fda-approved contraceptives. the law places limits on insurance plans administrative overhead spending and profits and requires plans to pay for a certain percentage of health care costs (though most plans already satisfy this requirement). it also eliminates insurers limits on total lifetime benefits and limits the size of deductibles in small firms health insurance plans. some people may be eligible for subsidies to help them offset their out-of-pocket costs on medical care. the health reform law reduces payments to medicare advantage plans (private plans that enroll medicare beneficiaries). enrollees in medicare advantage plans may have to pay more for their care in the future.,will my insurance costs go up under health reform?,"['medicare', 'health insurance', 'affordable care act']",wmd

aww! poor baby. teething is such a rough time of life. you're right to be concerned if your toddler is in so much pain that he's not getting enough fluids or food. in general fluids are more important than food so try to make sure he at least gets plenty of water -- even if it's mixed with kool aid or crystal light or some other flavoring to make it taste better to him. here are some other things you can try to soothe a teething toddler: give him a cold wet washcloth to chew on. let him eat popsicles. give a mild pain reliever like acetaminophen (tylenol) or ibuprofen (advil) -- but never give real aspirin to children under the age of . try using a blender to liquefy his favorite meal. give him ice cream.

would you like nitrates with that? this is the question that we need to start asking ourselves when we walk through the grocery aisle order in a restaurant and particularly when we feed our children. more data emerges every day which challenges our previous notions of the relative significance of particular fats or micro nutrients. doctors and nutritionists are focusing more on how our food is made. processed food contains high amounts of salt nitrates and other chemicals used as preservatives and flavor enhancers – most of which the typical person knows little or nothing about. while this is old news recent data is emerging that suggests that the processing may pose more of a health risk than previously recognized. a few months ago i blogged about a study that suggested that saturated fat intake was not clearly associated with future risk of heart disease – this research contradicts some of our commonly shared recommendations and has forced the american heart association? and other organizations to seriously rethink not only our recommendations but how we come to arrive at them. common wisdom is taking an appropriate backseat to research. so i was excited to read about a more recent study which tries to tease apart why foods high in saturated fat would appear to be associated with an increased risk of heart disease. harvard researchers examined the results of  different studies involving .  million people. they found that eating unprocessed meat (think steak or unprocessed pork or lamb) was not associated with any increased risk of heart disease but eating processed meats (like cold cuts sausage and bacon) was linked to a % increased risk of heart disease and % increased risk of diabetes. they specifically looked at the saturated fat content between the unprocessed and processed meats and didnt find much of a difference. but nitrates and salt might account for some of the disparity. all it took was a typical serving a day (like a hot dog or some sliced cold cuts in a sandwich) to reach this risk. when you consider the number of people who have bacon for breakfast most days of the week or have a ham sandwich for lunch every day the impact of processing is impressive. the authors? of the study also make the point that unprocessed meat may also have other noncardiac health risks such as colorectal cancer and other malignancies. many americans tend to accept processing antibiotics and hormones in their food without much of a fight – these additives may make our food more flavorful and likely cheaper as well. but it seems as thoughprocessing may come at a price – an increased risk of heart disease. you can take some steps to reduce your risk by avoiding bacon sausage and all deli meats and try to focus on eating real food.,how do processed foods affect heart health?,"['heart', 'food']",wmd

i wouldn't worry about how large your breast are currently. they will likely grow some during your later stage of pregnancy as well as when your milk starts coming in after delivery. breast tissue covers a larger area than just the part that sticks out.

"although there are several good ways to diagnose lactose intolerance most people who consider themselves lactose intolerant have never been formally tested for intolerance. this is unfortunate because at least % of people who think they are lactose intolerant are not and % of people who think they are not intolerant in fact are intolerant. why should so many people believe that they are lactose intolerant when they are not? this erroneous belief may be common for several reasons. people with unexplained (undiagnosed) gastrointestinal symptoms are looking for an explanation for their symptoms. since lactose intolerance is a well-known condition it provides these people with a ready (and welcome) explanation for their symptoms. confirmation that lactose intolerance is present often is made subjectively and without careful correlation between ingestion of milk or milk products and symptoms. extrapolating from data on the effect of placebo it can be hypothesized that between  and  percent of people who think they feel better on stopping milk in fact are no better. feeling better for them is analogous to a beneficial (positive) response to placebo. formal testing for lactose intolerance is valuable. not only can testing confirm lactose intolerance and prompt the institution of a reduced or lactose-free diet but it also can exclude lactose intolerance and direct attention to diagnosing other conditions and diseases that are responsible for the symptoms. elimination diet probably the most common way that people self-diagnose lactose intolerance is by an elimination diet a diet that eliminates milk and milk products. there are several problems with this type of ""testing. "" milk products are so common in prepared foods from the supermarket or restaurant that it is likely that an elimination diet that is not rigorous (i. e. does not eliminate all milk-containing products) will still include substantial amounts of milk. thus persons with severe lactase deficiency attempting an elimination diet may be ingesting enough lactose to have symptoms and erroneously conclude that lactose intolerance is not responsible for the symptoms. people often make the assumption that they are lactose intolerant based on a short trial of elimination. a short trial may be adequate if symptoms are severe and occurring daily but not if the symptoms are subtle and/or variable. in the latter case an elimination diet may need to be continued for several weeks. because symptoms of lactose intolerance are subjective and variable there always is the possibility of a ""placebo effect"" in which people think they feel better eliminating milk when in fact they are no better. as discussed previously with subjective symptoms such as those of lactose intolerance a placebo effect might be expected to occur %-% of the time. if an elimination diet is to be used for diagnosing lactose intolerance it should be a rigorous diet. a rigorous diet requires counseling by a dietician or reading a guide to a lactose-elimination diet. the diet also needs to be continued long enough to clearly evaluate whether or not symptoms are better. if there is doubt about improvement on the diet particularly if symptoms normally fluctuate in intensity over weeks or months repeated periods of lactose elimination should be tried until a firm conclusion can be drawn. elimination of all milk products should eliminate symptoms completely if lactose intolerance alone is the cause of the symptoms.",how are lactase deficiency and lactose intolerance diagnosed?,"['lactose intolerance', 'lactase']",wmd

some people who abuse drugs show symptoms similar to those of schizophrenia. therefore people with schizophrenia may be mistaken for people who are affected by drugs. most researchers do not believe that substance abuse causes schizophrenia. however people who have schizophrenia are much more likely to have a substance or alcohol abuse problem than the general population. substance abuse can make treatment for schizophrenia less effective. some drugs like marijuana and stimulants such as amphetamines or cocaine may make symptoms worse. in fact research has found increasing evidence of a link between marijuana and schizophrenia symptoms. in addition people who abuse drugs are less likely to follow their treatment plan. schizophrenia and smoking addiction to nicotine is the most common form of substance abuse in people with schizophrenia. they are addicted to nicotine at three times the rate of the general population ( to  percent vs.  to  percent). the relationship between smoking and schizophrenia is complex. people with schizophrenia seem to be driven to smoke and researchers are exploring whether there is a biological basis for this need. in addition to its known health hazards several studies have found that smoking may make antipsychotic drugs less effective. quitting smoking may be very difficult for people with schizophrenia because nicotine withdrawal may cause their psychotic symptoms to get worse for a while. quitting strategies that include nicotine replacement methods may be easier for patients to handle. doctors who treat people with schizophrenia should watch their patients' response to antipsychotic medication carefully if the patient decides to start or stop smoking.,how does substance abuse affect schizophrenia?,"['drug abuse', 'schizophrenia']",wmd

here are four steps you can take now to prevent osteoarthritis or its progression. no. : control your weight if you are at a healthy weight maintaining that weight may be the most important thing you can do to prevent osteoarthritis. if you are overweight losing weight may be your best hedge against the disease. obesity is clearly a risk factor for developing osteoarthritis. data from the first national health and nutrition examination survey a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutrition of americans showed that obese women were nearly four times as likely as non-obese women to have osteoarthritis. the risk for obese men was nearly five times greater than for non-obese men. being overweight strains the joints particularly those that bear the body's weight such as the knees hips and joints of the feet causing the cartilage to wear away. if you already have osteoarthritis losing weight may help improve symptoms. no. : exercise if the muscles that run along the front of the thigh are weak research shows you have an increased risk of painful knee osteoarthritis. fortunately even relatively minor increases in the strength of these muscles the quadriceps can reduce the risk. if fear of joint pain after exercise keeps you from exercising try using heat and cold on painful joints or take pain relievers which may make it easier for you to exercise and stay active. the safest exercises are those that place the least body weight on the joints such as bicycling swimming and water exercise. light weight lifting exercises are another option but if you already have osteoarthritis first speak with your doctor. no. : avoid injuries or get them treated suffering a joint injury when you are young predisposes you to osteoarthritis in the same joint when you are older. injuring a joint as an adult may put the joint at even greater risk. people who injured their knee as an adult had a five times greater risk of osteoarthritis in the joint. to avoid joint injuries when exercising or playing sports the national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases recommends the following: avoid bending knees past  degrees when doing half knee bends. keep feet as flat as possible during stretches to avoid twisting knees. when jumping land with your knees bent. do warm-up exercises before sports even less vigorous ones such as golf. cool down after vigorous sports. wear properly fitting shoes that provide shock absorption and stability. exercise on the softest surface available; avoid running on asphalt and concrete. if you have a joint injury it's important to get prompt medical treatment and take steps to avoid further damage such as modifying high-impact movements or using a brace to stabilize the joint. no. : eat right although no specific diet has been shown to prevent osteoarthritis certain nutrients have been associated with a reduced risk of the disease or its severity. they include: omega- fatty acids. these healthy fats reduce joint inflammation while unhealthy fats can increase it. good sources of omega- fatty acids include fish oil and certain plant/nut oils including walnut canola soybean flaxseed/linseed and olive. vitamin c. one study of participants in the framingham study found that moderate intake of vitamin c (- milligrams per day) reduced the risk of osteoarthritis progression threefold. you can get more vitamin c in your diet by eating green peppers citrus fruits and juices strawberries tomatoes broccoli turnip greens and other leafy greens sweet and white potatoes and cantaloupe. vitamin d. another study of framingham study participants showed that people who have knee osteoarthritis and low blood levels of vitamin d are three times more likely to experience disease progression compared to people with high levels of the vitamin. your body makes most of the vitamin d it needs in response to sunlight. you can get more vitamin d in your diet by eating fatty fish such as salmon mackerel tuna sardines and herring; vitamin d-fortified milk and cereal; and eggs.,what can i do to prevent osteoarthritis or its progression?,['osteoarthritis'],wmd

"a transient ischemic attack (tia mini-stroke) is a short-lived stroke that gets better and resolves. it is a short-lived episode (less than  hours) of temporary impairment if brain function that is caused by a loss of blood supply. a tia causes a loss of function in the area of the body that is controlled by the portion of the brain affected. the loss of blood supply to the brain is most often caused by a clot that spontaneously forms in a blood vessel within the brain (thrombosis). however it can also result from a clot that forms elsewhere in the body dislodges from that location and travels to lodge in an artery of the brain (emboli). a spasm and rarely a bleed are other causes of a tia. many people refer to a tia as a ""mini-stroke. "" some tias develop slowly while others develop rapidly. by definition all tias resolve within  hours. strokes take longer to resolve than tias and with strokes complete function may never return and reflect a more permanent and serious problem. although most tias often last only a few minutes all tias should be evaluated with the same urgency as a stroke in an effort to prevent recurrences and/or strokes. tias can occur once multiple times or precede a permanent stroke. a transient ischemic attack should be considered an emergency because there is no guarantee that the situation will resolve and function will return. a tia from a clot in the blood vessel that supplies the retina of the eye can cause temporary visual loss (amaurosis fugax) which is often described as the sensation of a curtain coming down. a tia that involves the carotid artery (the largest blood vessel supplying the brain) can produce problems with movement or sensation on one side of the body which is the side opposite to the actual blockage. an affected patient may experience temporary double vision dizziness (vertigo) loss of balance one sided weakness or complete paralysis of the arm leg face or one whole side of the body or be unable to speak or understand commands.",what is a transient ischemic attack?,['transient ischemic attack'],wmd

the actual minimal number of calories that you can safely eat long term depends on your basal metabolic rate (bmr) which is the energy necessary for your body and its organs to maintain normal function while simply at rest. although there are equations to calculate bmr such as the harris-benedict equation these are all theoretical estimations and your actual number could vary. there are other more accurate methods to calculate your bmr through either direct or indirect calorimetry techniques that usually measure gas exchange between oxygen consumption and  production. you could do an internet search to find test facilities near you for these methods if youre genuinely curious otherwise the bmr equations might give you a good enough estimate. youre correct in stating that   calories is typically the conventional lower threshold value given and i think that its fair to use as an estimate for most of the general population (again your actual number will vary). by far however  calories per day would be considered a very low calorie diet (vlcd) because it would be very hard to meet your nutritional needs with so few calories. this type of diet would generally not be recommended for individuals who are not obese and who dont have proper medical supervision. your doctor will take your specific circumstances into consideration before helping you decide if you should go on a vlcd and you may need to work with a dietitian to develop a specific eating plan to help ensure that you meet your nutrient needs while following the diet. its important to note that although vlcds have been shown to lower weight and help with obesity-related conditions like hypertension diabetes or high cholesterol in obese individuals; they dont seem to be any more effective than a more modest dietary eating plan long term. you will likely regain any weight loss after going off the vlcd unless you transition into a healthy eating plan while incorporating regular exercise which is another aspect of why medical supervision from your doctor or a dietitian would be essential.,what is the minimum number of calories a woman can safely eat long term (up to two years or more)? . ive seen numbers ranging from  to  (even here on webmd) where  might be the break between low calorie and very low calorie and  is where your body enters starvation mode. .  is the conventional number but is this in keeping with modern understanding? if a person opted for  without supervision would this be safe and sustainable long-term provided it was followed with proper transition and maintenance?,['calorie'],wmd

two ultrasound studies of women who exercised their vaginal muscles did find that their muscles were thicker and stronger after pelvic floor muscle training. among women with urine leakage their thinner muscles became the thickness of healthy women's pelvic floor muscles. additionally they had less urine leakage -- whether the problem was from stress or urge types of incontinence. the use of vaginal cones and/or kegel exercises to increase muscle strength were both found to improve tone and decrease urine loss. while some of these studies did not measure vaginal tightness per se when muscle bulk is increased a woman can voluntarily contract those muscles to make the vaginal opening tighter.,will exercising the vaginal muscles make my vagina tighter?,"['muscle', 'vagina', 'exercise']",wmd

i think sometimes parents jump to the conclusion that a babys gas or fussiness is caused by their baby formula. instead it just may be that baby is at a stage when shes colicky. so instead of changing babys formula all around youd really do better to talk to your pediatrician. thats because intolerance to the baby formula is much less likely than colic for which we have no known cause -- or cure. so instead of parents agonizing about the formula they probably just need to wait until baby outgrows the colic which is usually at about three months. another common bottle-feeding problem is the way parents position babies: some lie them completely flat which can make babies choke when feeding on the bottle. so be sure to have your baby semi-inclined or upright. another common mistake is propping the bottle. dont prop babys bottle; it can be a choking hazard. that is also why you should also always be present when baby is feeding even when shes old enough to hold her own bottle. . the main thing: do lots of trial-and-error to be sure you find a bottle and nipple combination that works for your child. so dont stock up on too many of the same kind of bottles unless you know your child is going to take it well. actually the same goes for formula diapers and all baby things:  unless you know your baby is adjusted to that type or brand. also when youre bottle feeding make sure milk is filling up the nipple of babys bottle. otherwise she could swallow a lot of air.,what are some common bottle-feeding problems and mistakes?,['feeding'],wmd

most helpful answer in  the institute of medicine made a general recommendation of  (a little over  cups) for women and  (over  cups) for men of total fluid intake each day. there are some things to keep in mind however. its estimated that -% of your fluid intake comes from the food that youre eating. for example lettuce can be around % water carrots % and broccoli %. in fact most of the foods that you eat contain some percentage of water even things like bread. the majority of our fluid intake comes from the liquids we consume. things like tea juice or coffee do count towards that total fluid intake each day. although there is a net gain some liquids that contain caffeine act as a diuretic (meaning that it makes you have to urinate) so there will be some small water loss due to that. prolonged physical activity or heat exposure will also increase water losses and may therefore raise your daily fluid needs. one way to determine your level of hydration is to look at your urine which should be fairly clear. if your urine is a very dark yellow then you may need to be drinking more water. yes it is necessary to drink  glass water per day. in todays life everyone is health concious and all want to become fit and away from diseases. we can take other liquid also instead of water for health purpose and for energy level we can take fruits juice fruit tea and other drinks also. yes it needs to be water the other drinks are in addition to.,does the body actually need  of water per day or do other fluids count towards thia total as well? . some days i only post  or  out of  glasses of water on the webmd food and fitness planner chart but i also drink tea coffee and juice during the day. . does it really matter if the liquid isn't water?,"['coffee', 'juice', 'tea', 'food', 'fitness']",wmd

using a condom correctly and consistently can protect against unwanted pregnancies and hiv/aids as well as a variety of other sexually transmitted diseases including hepatitis b gonorrhea syphilis and the virus that cause genital warts. health experts credit the widespread use of condoms for reining in the hiv/aids epidemic in many parts of the world. some studies show that condoms are more than % effective at preventing hiv transmission. here are some tips for getting the maximum protection from condoms: don't take it off before ejaculation. store condoms in a cool and dry place out of sunlight. your wallet's fine for the weekend but don't depend on a rubber you tucked away a year ago. check the expiration date. if yours has expired toss it. don't reuse condoms. use a new condom if you switch from vaginal sex to anal sex and vice versa. for latex condoms use only water-based lubricants (k-y and astroglide for instance). don't depend on natural skin or lambskin condoms to protect against stds. if you're sensitive or allergic to latex try a synthetic condom (usually made of polyurethane). these typically have a longer shelf life and can be used with both water- and oil-based lubricants. the downside: the ability of synthetics to fully protect against stds hasn't been proved. avoid condoms with spermicide. these are no more effective than plain condoms at preventing pregnancy and they have a shorter shelf life. make donning a condom part of the pleasure of foreplay. that way you're less likely to lose your erection.,how do i get maximum protection from a condom?,['condom'],wmd

symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning range from mild flu -like symptoms (such as a headache or stomachache without fever ) to severe signs of heart and brain damage. prolonged exposure to low levels of carbon monoxide over many days may result in death. people respond differently to the same level of carbon monoxide. because of this carbon monoxide poisoning can range from mild to severe in different people with the same level of exposure. a person who has mild symptoms usually does not even suspect carbon monoxide poisoning. early symptoms can mimic the flu or a number of other conditions with similar symptoms which can make it difficult for a doctor to diagnose. it is possible that a person with more severe poisoning may not even be aware of the seriousness of the condition because the exposure to carbon monoxide may cause fatigue and confusion. if a person has symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning or if carbon monoxide poisoning is suspected first get the person out of the polluted area and then call. symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are often similar to symptoms of other illnesses. these symptoms include:  headache. nausea vomiting (often seen in children). dizziness. fatigue. more severe symptoms may include: confusion drowsiness. rapid breathing or pulse rate. vision problems. chest pain. convulsions seizures. loss of consciousness. symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning change with different blood concentrations of carboxyhemoglobin ( hemoglobin that has bonded with carbon monoxide instead of oxygen). some situations may provide clues to carbon monoxide exposure. for example if a family or group of people who live or work in the same building complain of headaches or flu-like symptoms these symptoms may be caused by high levels of carbon monoxide. also family pets living in the home may become sick which can be another clue to diagnosing carbon monoxide poisoning. in the winter unexplained headaches nausea or dizziness may be caused by heating systems that are not working correctly and are causing a buildup of carbon monoxide. delayed symptoms or long-term adverse effects of carbon monoxide poisoning can occur days or weeks after poisoning. the delayed symptoms or effects may include memory loss changes in personality disorientation impaired reasoning ability and behavioral or learning difficulties.  webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,what are the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning?,['poisoning'],wmd

i'm  and recovering from anorexia and bulimia. i have been at a stable weight for roughly a year and a half. when i was your age i became severely underweight and had to be admitted to an inpatient treatment center. all that you have written sounds exactly like how i felt and how i thought when i was suffering from the disease most. i would constantly research diet strategies exorcises and ways to cope with the depression that soon hit me. like you and all others that suffer from eating disorders i was obsessed. i became obsessed to drown out everything else. when i was thinking about controlling my weight i wasn't thinking about the painful things in my life. i hated the way i looked. no one had ever called me fat or teased me for the way i looked. but i was unhappy with my body because it wasn't exactly what i wanted to be. at the time there were many things in my life i could not control so i turned to controlling my body instead in addition to blocking out other painful thoughts by focusing on my eating disorder. it was very hard to recover and for a very long time i had no hope. however i promise it does get better.  is a very rough age. it is when you start truly becoming an adult and molding who you are. it is confusing scary and overall hard to handle. perhaps this is one reason you prefer to focus on your body and eating habits because then you do not have to focus on the other turmoil life throws at you. i cannot give you answers on how to recover but i can give you some motivation to seek help based on my experience. because i was underweight: i stopped getting my period. i still have not gotten it back. it is very likely i will never be able to have children. this may be the most devastating consequence of all. i lost almost half of my hair. it used to be beautiful and straight but now even many months after being at a stable weight it is thin wispy and unpredictable. due to lack of nutrition i still have not fully developed a woman's body. my breasts are small my hips are straight and i have little curves as a woman should have. it is very often i am mistaken for an age much younger than i actually am. i am an adult now however it is hard for people to see me as one as i look much much younger than i am. because i was sick: those around me suffered from watching me hurt myself more than i could ever understand. i was unaware at the time too engulfed in my obsession to realize their pain. my relationships have never been the same. some have simply changed in their dynamic but some are shattered beyond repair. i missed two months of school during my junior year while in treatment. some people are able to be effectively treated by a treatment team they visit a few times a week however my sickness became too severe for this type to be effective. those are two months of my teenage years i will never get back. tack on the  months i was severely underweight and depressed as a result of anorexia and that's nearly a year of my childhood lost to an eating disorder. much of my time today is still dedicated to recovering and fighting relapse. there are absolutely countless consequences of eating disorders. unfortunately your thoughts make it seem as though you may already be wrapped up in one. asking for help may not be what you want. it may be hard and maybe even embarrassing. however if i could tell my  year old self one thing it would be that help has always been hard to ask for but now than ever more important to seek. it took me months of suffering and unsuccessfully trying to recover to realize that i could not recover on my own. once i asked for help i found i had stopped feeling so helpless depressed and disheartened for i finally felt hope that i would get better. for me it took months but happiness does find a way to re-enter your life if you try to find it again. think hard not just about today but years from now as well. eating disorders put everything in your future at risk but getting help can make a world of difference.,why am i obsessed with eating disorders and losing weight? . i'm  and basically i hate the way i look and i hate myself for saying this but i want to be underweight. during the week i teat as little as i can and sometimes purge and also get guilty over eating a small amount but then at the weekend i tend to binge with barely any guilt. i research eating disorders and weight loss/exercise every night and it's the first thing i think of in the morning. i am obsessed with all to do with eating disorders and weight loss. why is this and what should i do?,"['eating disorder', 'weight', 'exercise', 'weight loss']",wmd
