why is it that the medical profession is so behind the times when it comes to considering the feelings of husbands as it pertains to their wive's medical care. i just recently learned about the exams my wife has been subjected to on a yearly basis (at least one of the following: pelvic exam pap smear breast exam). it depresses and angers me that a male physician can perform those exams without my consent. meanwhile the same doctor over the course of more than  years has never asked me to remove anything more than my shirt while she is asked to strip down every time she sees him. i think without the consent of both partners in a marriage that it should be illegal for an opposite sex health care professional to perform invasive exams of this nature. we're not talking about an emergency here and i feel that he has caused irreparable damage to our marriage and has taken something from me that i can't ever get back. what is your take on this?

had prostate removed due to cancer  years ago when i was . have had a few issues with erectile dysfunction however with viagra cialis or levitra i'm able to get a great erection. my problem is with the dry orgasm (or should i say lack of orgasm). for the first year or so after the surgery i could barely tell if i was having an orgasm. it has since got a little better but absolutely nothing like it was before when i ejaculated and after  years it just seems like it continues to dwindle. i have a very high sex drive (testosterone was recently checked and it is abnormally high for someone my age) but my orgasms are hardly worth the effort anymore. is there anything you can recommend that would or could improve the quality of my dry orgasms? i realize they'll never ever be the same as they were before without ejaculating but i've talked with other men who have had radical prostatectomies and they don't seem to have any complaints or have this lack of sensation.
