hello i'm 20 years old and i've always seemed to have almost random outbursts of anger. i first started this when i was in 1st grade where i would have 1-2 hour bursts of anger followed by a long fit of crying. i would completely freak out and start trying to injure myself start shouting resisting people trying to calm me etc. it would be quite frequent (at least once a week) and would continue up until the end of 6th grade where after 6th grade i thought it was gone for good. until i had an episode when i was a sophomore in high school when walking around with friends. it was the same as before punching a stone wall shouting incoherently the exact same type of thing. after that i usually have an episode about one time every year sometimes two. sometimes i'll also feel very depressed for about 1-2 hours as well with it just ending almost abruptly. i've always absolutely hated what this is and i want to have an idea of what is going on. thanks for reading.
