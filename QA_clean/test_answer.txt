i have never heard this. i have heard that it's important for seniors and young children to get the flu shot because they are at higher risk of having a severe case of flu or death. i make sure my children get a flu shot every year although they are never happy about it! here's some information from the cdc:  
"i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. my concern is that you don't have shingles at all. normally shingles isn't described as ""hives all over the body"" that ""itch. "" in fact if you have welts on both sides of your body (as divided by the spinal column) then i can guarantee you do not have shingles. shingles only affects one side of the body at a time. even though you don't currently have health insurance i'd suggest you find a way to get checked out by a medical professional preferably when you're having an outbreak of these hives. most communities have free or low-cost medical clinics to serve people who have no insurance. you can locate one of these clinics near you by calling your local medicaid office or by performing an internet search for ""free health clinic"" and your city name. i wish you all the best at finding a solution to this annoying condition!"
for most people including children and teens the challenge is to get enough physical activity. however excessive exercise and overtraining often coupled with restrictive eating can be a problem especially for some female athletes and dancers as well as girls who become obsessive about weight loss. overtraining like eating disorders can result in decreased estrogen and eventually lead to thin bones that break easily. years ago it was not unusual for coaches and trainers to encourage athletes to be as thin as possible for many sports including dancing gymnastics figure skating running and diving. fortunately many coaches now realize that being too thin is unhealthy and can negatively affect performance as well as lifelong health.

"most helpful answer washing up after sex will not wash away any semen that is deposited and entrapped in the cervical mucous  these are the sperm that have a chance of impregnation. advice is mixed about lying on your back or with a pillow under your buttocks to encourage gravity to help but it is fine to do so don't jump up and rush to the shower. i don't believe the contracting your vaginal muscles will help that much for increasing your chances of conception but doing these kegel-type exercises has some other advantages. having an intense orgasm during intercourse will help so remind your partner to be generous and considerate. my husband and i use wild wipes and we love them! wild wipes are intimate wipes for men and women they're really soft and smell really nice! their website is www. wildwipes. com and if you use promo code ""wild"" you get free shipping too"

"it sounds like you and your family are covered by a ""grandfathered"" health plan. these are plans that were in place prior to the affordable care act becoming law in march 2010. grandfathered plans lose their status when they make significant changes to their benefits or charge considerably more for things like co-pays co-insurance and deductibles. it's expected that in the next few years most employer-sponsored plans will lose their grandfathered status which means they will have to comply to all parts of the law including providing preventive services with no cost-sharing."

dark (yellow) phlegm could be a sign of an infection or at least stagnation of mucous in your nose sinuses or lungs. the fact that it is foul-tasting is another sign of a possible infection. the color of mucous is not as important is the entire package of symptoms that you may be experiencing so if this continues you may need to see a medical evaluation. in the meantime drink plenty of water (this will thin your mucous) humidify the air (humidifier or a hot steamy shower) and consider trying a decongestant during the day. if the underlying cause is a cold (viral) then you should be improving in a few days. if you are having sinus pain sore throat chest pain or fever then it would not be prudent to wait it out.

in my opinion. no. there could be a link between chlorophyll usage and hair loss / fertility issues. but the bottom line is that there is no scientific evidence through verifable studies proving that chlorophyll will cause hair growth or impact conception odds. with that said chlorophyll seems to have many possible beneficial properties. it may be a worthwhile time investment to discuss chlorophyll usage with your physician before its purchase and consumption. chlorophyll is found in green leafy vegetables and may be located in liquid form throughout health food stores. many natural medicine proponents claim that chlorophyll is a detox agent effective in heart health and protects against cancer. other claims include improvements in digestion bad breath body odor and gas conditions. specifically mentioned as effective in hormonal balancing according to the encyclopedia of natural medicine women taking chlorophyll experienced correction in conditions such as delayed menstruation and p. m. s. additionally menopause symptoms such as dry skin irritability depression and hair loss also showed improvement. in summary its worth some additional research and talking with your doctor about chlorophyll claims. although there is no scientific evidence of chlorophyll causing hair growth or stimulating conception some natural medicine experts cite menstruation improvement and a reduction of hair loss.

i'm sorry to hear you're going through a merry-go-round of diagnosis. sometimes skin rashes and lesions can be difficult to diagnose so hang in there. to answer your question yes lupus can indeed cause skin lesions. lupus comes in different forms. one type of lupus called cutaneous lupus or discoid lupus involves the formation of skin lesions that may be red and scaly or ring-shaped. these lesions typically form on sun-exposed areas of skin such as the arms legs scalp back of the neck and so on. but they can occur anywhere on the body. systemic lupus can cause a variety of other skin issues too. people with lupus erythematosus often experience hair loss raised sores called vasculitis lesions blotchy patches of skin and many other skin irritations. your situation illustrates why a skin rash should not be ignored (and i'm glad you didn't ignore yours! ). occasionally a rash can signal a serious underlying medical condition like lupus. in general if a skin rash doesn't clear up within hours or a couple of days you should have it checked out by a doctor. skin rashes accompanied by trouble breathing require emergency medical treatment. wishing you well!

"it's difficult to answer your question without more information. when people have copd and use home oxygen therapy they often are told not to set the oxygen delivery rate above a certain number. this is very important. it's not exactly because a person can ""get too much oxygen "" but rather because breathing is not only a matter of taking in oxygen  it's also a matter of exhaling carbon dioxide. if a copd patient sets their oxygen delivery rate too high they risk upsetting the balance between taking oxygen in and breathing carbon dioxide out. if you retain carbon dioxide it can be harmful to your health. if you have any questions related to your personal oxygen needs or the oxygen requirements of a loved one don't hesitate to ask your primary health care provider or a respiratory therapist. these experts can help you understand how your lungs work whether or not you need oxygen therapy and much more. i hope this answers your question!"
yes stress can cause bradycardia or reduced heart rate and as you have a recent stressful event it can be a cause. so my advise to you is to first of all relax and start doing meditation and deep breathing exercises. take nutritious and a sufficient sleep of atleast 8 hours. if at all the symptoms does not get better then consult a cardiologist and get a thorough evaluation done. hope this helps.

phthalates which are found in many nail polishes have been studied for a potential risk of causing birth defects. however evidence does not currently suggest a connection between phthalates and birth defects in humans. but studies in animals have shown these substances interfere with male sexual development so caution may be warranted. to be on the safe side you can use phthalate-free nail polish. or polish your nails in a well-ventilated area to limit your exposure. once the polish dries there's little risk to your baby since chemicals aren't absorbed through the nails. here's a great article on pregnancy-proofing your beauty regimen. i personally avoided most nail polish when i was pregnant. the story below says to avoid polish with phthalates which have been linked to birth defects. look at the ingredients list on your polish to be sure. if you go to a salon and are not sure if they carry phthlate-free brands take your own. some brands said to be free of phthlates include essie revlon and l'oreal but remember to check the label as they come out with new types all the time. none of these links are definitely proven of course but why not play it safe until we know for sure?

infectious mononucleosis or mono is caused by epstein-barr virus (ebv) a member of the herpes virus family. its spread during close physical contact mostly through transmission of saliva. (thats pretty close earning mono its nickname kissing disease. ) ninety percent to 95% of people in the u. s. eventually are infected by ebv although not all of them develop full-blown mononucleosis. people can transmit ebv to other people for six months or longer after recovering from mononucleosis. in studies many people continue to have ebv in their saliva for up to 18 months after symptoms of mono have resolved. thats why most people who get mononucleosis dont remember being around (or kissing) someone with mono. its also possible to periodically shed ebv virus in ones saliva throughout life without having symptoms. its not clear if people commonly transmit the virus during these periods. fever sore throat fatigue and swollen tonsils and lymph nodes are the usual symptoms of mono. the worst of the symptoms go away in one to two weeks but fatigue can last for months. vetsika ek. expert reviews in molecular medicine 2004; vol 6(23): pp 1-16. fafi-kremer s. journal of infectious disease 2005; vol 191(6): pp 985-989.

drugs used to treat nausea and vomiting are called antiemetics. many types of antiemetics can decrease the severity of nausea although most require a medical evaluation and prescription. medicines available over-the-counter are mainly recommended for use in motion sickness and for cases of mild nausea. meclizine hydrochloride (bonine) is an antihistamine that is effective in the treatment of nausea vomiting and dizziness associated with motion sickness. unless recommended by a doctor it should not be taken by people with lung diseases glaucoma or those who have difficulty urinating due to an enlarged prostate. meclizine may cause drowsiness and should not be taken with other sedatives such as alcohol tranquilizers or sleeping pills. due to drowsiness people using meclizine should not drive or operate dangerous machinery. meclizine is not recommended in children under 12 or in pregnant or nursing women unless recommended by a doctor. dimenhydrinate (dramamine) also is an antihistamine. its use should be limited to motion sickness. it can cause drowsiness and should be avoided in the same situations as meclizine. several different formulations of dimenhydrinate are available including a children's liquid which should be used according to the directions under the direction of a doctor. dramamine less drowsy formula contains meclizine like bonine and may have fewer sedative side effects. both meclizine and dimenhydrinate are recommended to be taken about an hour before travel to prevent motion sickness. emetrol is an oral solution designed to soothe the stomach when nausea and vomiting are caused by a viral or bacterial infection or overeating. emetrol contains sugar and phosphoric acid. diabetes patients should not use emetrol without medical supervision because of the concentrated sugar. according to its manufacturer emetrol should not be taken for more than five doses in one hour without consulting a doctor. consult a doctor before using this medicine for pregnant or nursing women and young children. bismuth subsalicylate (pepto-bismol) is a product containing bismuth subsalicylate a chemical shown to be effective in relieving nausea and upset stomach. this remedy has a direct effect on the stomach lining and has no known serious side effects. it may cause darkening of the stool color and of the tongue. pregnant or nursing women should consult their doctors before using bismuth subsalicylate since part of the active ingredient (salicylate) is chemically similar to aspirin which may harm infants and the fetus. patients allergic to aspirin or related drugs also should not use bismuth subsalicylate. use under the direction of a doctor if you take anticoagulants (blood thinners) or have diabetes or gout because the salicylate may further promote the anticoagulant effect.

firstly congrats on being independent and living on your own. its a big step but a great one. and at times yes you may feel down or irritated but this can all be helped! your anxiety can also be controlled and personally i think you should be doing this through eating the right foods including lots of raw fruit and vegetables dairy free milk such as oat milk soy milk almond milk or if you do not like that at least low or no fat milk. cut out on all processed foods that contain presertitives flavours or flavor enhancers artificial colors added sugar and high salts. this all has effects on the body and is un-natural. just changing what you eat will help your thought processes. decent exercise is also a great way to relieve anxiety and depression. doing good will make you feel good! and lots of good un-interupted sleep is very important too. at least 8-10 hours. i dont think the zoloft is doing you any good. these are synthetic chemicals that do more damage to your head and body in the long run. join a yoga class or do some volunteer work. getting out and meeting people will make you feel good. try to learn something new everyday and keep your mind active. don't let bad thoughts get in the way of enjoying this precious life you have. hope this helps you in some way  keep positive!
genital warts are similar to cold sores once the virus is in your system there is no removing it the virus can lay dormant for many years before reoccurring. if you notice that you are experiencing symptoms again i would visit your doctor.
"anger is not unusual for people on the autism spectrum. the rage can come on suddenly, seemingly from nowhere, and then vanish just as quickly. triggers include stress, sensory overload, being ignored, and a change in routine. a person with autism spectrum disorder may have trouble communicating, making things even harder. they may not even realize they are acting out of anger. part of the solution is becoming more aware of themselves and situations."

tell the doctor asap!
wart remover products in the drugstore contain usually salicylic acid. i don't like the ones that have the freeze because it's not cold enough to really cause enough damage to kill the wart virus. and oftentimes it can leave a scar on the skin. so that would be done by your dermatologist using liquid nitrogen which is really really cold and will eliminate the skin where the wart virus lives and then the wart virus is gone. so it's important to note that wart virus is everywhere. anything you touch chances are you are being exposed to wart virus. so don't be so concerned about having it transmitted to somebody else if you shake hands that's not as much of a concern. it's more just to get rid of it because it's uncomfortable. also it doesn't go beyond the skin. so this is truly simply a condition of the skin. some people are more prone to it genetically than others and sometimes more at some ages than others. the treatments that contain salicylic acid work pretty well but they take time. another treatment that has great medical literature behind it that shows it works as well as the in-office treatments that we do as dermatologist is duct tape. so i think every house or apartment comes with duct tape. i haven't seen one house where it doesn't exist. i think it's just magically there when you buy a house it's just in your house. you cut it slightly bigger than the size of the wart and wash the skin dry it well and then put it on the skin and hold your hand to the outside to warm the glue to the skin so it sticks really well. it seems that the glue is toxic to that wart virus and the thickness of the tape suffocates it. then after three days you just peel that off and put a new one on. if you don't like the way that silver duct tape looks you can put a bandage over it and it works great for wart virus of the foot as well.

if a man is suffering from erectile dysfunction then also a woman having sex with him get pregnant. i would explain you the logic erectile dysfunction is what? it is actually the problem of non-erection completely whereas the pregnancy is associated with the sperms if a person has good sperm quantity then woman get easily pregnant but if you want to cure the erectile dysfunction you can use the ejaculation pills which makes the penis harder but make sure that you use the pills having no side effects and such medicines with no side effects are the medicines which contains the natural herbal ingredients like catruaba bark yohimbe and horny goat weed. visit www. increaseejaculate. org to see and buy the medicine
i don't know if i have sleep apnea. i dont think i have ever been tested for it. i am an extremely deep sleeper but every so often i do wake up once or twice in the middle of the night before my alarm wakes me up. i just figured that is because where i live is very noisy due to people speeding by and other things (i'm basically in the city). normally i don't often have disrupted sleep and i usually don't get woken up by anything during the night.
mono can cause the liver and/or spleen to enlarge to the point that it is vulnerable to a blunt injury not uncommon in soccer. assuming that she does not have liver or spleen enlargement and her liver enzymes (a blood test) are normal she may be able to play. the doctor really should not have left it up to you. i agree. this is really a medical decision based on physical exam findings. mono can be mild. and mono can be very problematic so unfortunately without knowing the details of her particular case and of course those critical physical examination and lab findings you will need to put the ball back in the doctor's court to make this decision. yes she can. mononucleosis usually isn't very serious. it may subside on its own. in some cases they become immune to the disease. you may start her with herbs that increase general immunity like tinospora curcuma and triphala powder all in equal quantity at dose of 3 gms twice daily.
"at 11 years of age the ""normal"" blood pressure range is close to the same as it is for an adult. generally speaking the normal blood pressure range for an 11 year old boy or girl is around 115/75 to 125/85 or thereabouts. however this range can vary depending on many factors such as the fitness level of the child. a skinny kid who plays a lot of soccer probably will have a lower blood pressure than a larger kid who isn't very active. in that respect blood pressure in children isn't much different from blood pressure in adults. if you have concerns about your child's blood pressure you should consult your pediatrician. hope this helps!"
it will not it is the other way around. blood clots anywhere in the body especially in the brain and heart increases blood pressure. one of the reason is that brain and heart are poor anaerobic performer meaning of all body tissue this 2 cant perform well without enough oxygen so when there is a blood clot oxygen supply decreases as well and when oxygen supply decreases some of the cells starts to deteriorate and when those cells are damaged and start to die they releases enzymes that transmit impulses to our vital sign center(medulla oblongata) that they are lacking oxygen in response to those impulses it releases enzymes that tell our heart to increase its workload to increase perfusion of blood to those area affected by the blood clot. but this action only worsen patients w/ brain blood clots because as blood pressure increase those blood clots move further till the size or diameter of blood vessel is too small where it can totally block the blood flow. so it is advisable for patient w/ brain blood clot to have stable blood pressure most of the time

tuberculosis (tb) is an infection caused by slow-growing bacteria that grow best in areas of the body that have lots of blood and oxygen. thats why it is most often found in the lungs. this is called pulmonary tb. but tb can also spread to other parts of the body which is called extrapulmonary tb. treatment is often a success but it is a long process. it takes about 6 to 9 months to treat tb. tuberculosis is either latent or active. latent tb means that you have the tb bacteria in your body but your bodys defenses (immune system) are keeping it from turning into active tb. this means that you don't have any symptoms of tb right now and can't spread the disease to others. if you have latent tb it can become active tb. active tb means that the tb bacteria are growing and causing symptoms. if your lungs are infected with active tb it is easy to spread the disease to others. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

treatment of chlamydia involves antibiotics. a convenient single-dose therapy for chlamydia is 1 gram of azithromycin (zithromax zmax) by mouth. alternative treatments are often used however because of the high cost of this medication. the most common alternative treatment is a 100-milligram oral dose of doxycycline (vibramycin oracea adoxa atridox and others) twice per day for seven days. unlike gonorrhea there has been little if any resistance of chlamydia to currently used antibiotics. there are many other antibiotics that also have been effective against chlamydia. as with gonorrhea a condom or other protective barrier prevents the spread of the infection.

there are many seasonal reasons for the increase in the number of cases of otitis media (middle ear infections) but the no. 1 culprit has got to be colds. colds are due to viruses of course and kids are notorious for collecting them. the children that i see in day-care pre-school and the elementary years are usually active members of the cold of the month club.  colds are the no. 1 predisposing factor for ear infections. if we could prevent or at least control colds there would certainly be fewer ear infections. for generations researchers have tried to come up with an effective vaccine against colds but since there are over 200 different viruses â€” viruses that change/mutate â€” a vaccine is not likely any time soon. there are some good things about colds â€” really. colds are usually minor and self-limiting in about a week. these little annoying viruses do stimulate the immune system and a stronger immune system can fight off the more serious attacks. so even if we could prevent all colds it may be messing with mother nature and make things worse. like it not colds are here to stay at least for the foreseeable future. the cold and flu season is closely tied to the ear infection season or as i call it snowtitis. as the weather gets colds windows close and people tend to stay inside more. in closed spaces viruses are more likely to spread. if it is raining outside schools do not let the kids out for recess. ventilation in some schools is inadequate and hygiene is often non-existent. the janitorial staff will empty the trash but it would be rare for them to routinely disinfect surfaces. bathrooms may be clean at the start of the school day but tend to look like those outdoor privies in mumbai by lunch time. some children are more ear-infection prone. if one or both parents had lots of ear infections the apple may not fall far from the tree. children who go to day-care or preschool at an early age are more prone to get sick. some of those viruses may set the stage for middle-ear infections. after age six when kids have 50 or so colds under their immunity belt they get considerably fewer middle ear infections. breast-fed children are less likely to get ear infections than children who are bottle-fed and children who are given a bottle of milk to hold at bedtime are also more prone. children who are exposed to cigarette smoke tend to have more ear infections. there have even been studies that show that families who heat with wood stoves or fireplaces in the winter have a higher incidence. smoke of any type is not good for kids. the last risk factor worth mentioning is pacifiers. several european studies have shown these to be an ear-infection risk in children under four. i suspect kids over four are not using them at least i hope they are not. remember that ear pain is not necessarily an ear infection. parents and grandparents have been telling kids for generations to cover their ears when they are outside to prevent ear infections. this practice will not prevent ear infections but can prevent some cold-related ear pain that some (not all) people can experience. the sensory receptors in the ear canal can really fire up from a cold breeze. if you are cold-sensitive wear a hat or ear muffs but dont think it is going to ward off infections. oh and dont tell this to your grandma. i dont want to get any nasty postings. when you are getting out your winter clothing snow shovels windshield ice scrapes be prepared for a few trips to your medical provider. you may want to consider getting a home otoscope to add to your winter supplies.
using olive oil in a salad or cooking with it is one thing but drinking it is another issue entirely. i know of no contraindications for using olive oil while pregnant or otherwise but i am not sure your reasons to do so are valid. i have never heard that a shot of olive oil with cranberry juice every day for a week will flush out a sludgy gall bladder  i am very skeptical. drinking this much olive oil could cause a laxative effect. i do not think it would harm your baby but i have to tell yo that there are absolutely no studies that would prove safety. when you are pregnant the safety of you and your unborn baby is in the careful professional hands of your ob-gyn. before doing this i would suggest that you get a patient-specific okay.
as much as i would like to help you it would be impossible for me or any medical professional to be able to determine the reason(s) for your unwellness blindly over the internet. you will need to keep working with your doctors  those who know you and your medical history and those that have the ability to examine you first-hand and order any additional diagnostic tests  until these issues are solved. i know this is frustrating for you but some medical conditions defy an easy and quick explanation.
there has been much discussion about the low absorption of medications after gastric bypass surgery. in your case the absorption should not be affected. however we are more concerned about side effects from medications that can hurt your system after this serious procedure. pain medications have been used after gastric bypass surgery although sparingly. it is important to remember that vicodin (hydrocodone and acetaminophen) can cause constipation. we do not want to further increase your risk of discomfort. so minimal use of pain medication with or without a stool softener is advised. the important key is to weigh the risks and benefits. we do not want you to be in pain but we also dont want to over medicate or cause too many side effects. with proper rest and healing time pain medications may not have to be used at all. follow the advice and instructions you received from your surgeon.

without knowing the exact medication his father gave him it is really hard to say whether or not the combination is safe for your husband to take. keep in mind while over-the-counter medications are readily available safety is still important. there are still drug-drug interactions that can occur toxicities with taking too much and it is important to take medications whether prescription or over-the- counter for the right reasons. most over-the-counter sleep aids contain diphenhydramine as the active ingredient. if he was given 3 pills he could have taken too much. another thing to keep in mind is that many sleep aids contain a pain reliever such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. if he is taking percocet which contains oxycodone and acetaminophen he could be taking too much acetaminophen which can be very toxic. mixing over-the-counter medications with prescription medications is not as simple as one would think. it is really important to check with a medical professional to make sure there is no duplication or drug-drug interactions.

"homa calculation is a good adjunct to a1c and glucose testing in folks with type 2 diabete prediabetes or risk of diabetes due to family history or obesity. i believe more endocrinologists and other clinicians caring for such patients will use the homa calculator more routinely in the future. not to diagnose diabetes but rather to gain insight into the relative contributions of beta cell dysfunction and insulin resistance in folks with elevated a1c. i suspect homa can be used to spot people at risk for diabetes sooner than current screening tests (fasting glucose or a1c) however the appropriateness of this test for screening and perhaps for diagosis would need to be studied scientifically. in the meantime i believe it is a useful clinical tool under the right circumstances. . pancreatic beta cell function can be roughly estimated by measuring fasting insulin and glucose simultaneously (ask your doctor for these blood tests) then using. [a] homa calculator to assess the estimated beta cell activity and insulin resistance. . homa stands for ""homeostasis model assessment"". the general concept is that the higher your insulin resistance (due to excess body fat genetics or other causes) the harder your beta cells need to work to produce enough insulin to keep the glucose levels normal. someone with lots of insulin resistance say twice as much (200%) of a normal healthy person will have to have lots of beta cell activity (150% or 200%) just to compensate. over many years of excess beta cell activity (over 100% activity) then in some individuals the beta cell activity will start to peter out as reflected by lower insulin levels (or inappropriately non-elevated insulin levels in the face of mildly elevated glucose) and the calculator will indicate there is only around 50% beta cell activity. the a1c doesn't start to go up into the prediabetic range (a1c 6. 0-6. 4) until the beta cell activity is around 60%-50%. beta cell activity in the 40% or less range is what we see in type 2 diabetes. if we measured insulin and glucose and used the homa calculator in seemingly normal patients with moderate-to-high risk of eventual type 2 diabetessuch as patients with parents or siblings with type 2 or in patients wiith obesity then we could probably clarify the diabetes risk even sooner. we would not have to wait until beta cell function is 60%. we could spot it when it is at 80% etc. and monitor it. i think this is a concept scientists should explore further as a potential component of a national diabetes prevention/reversal strategy. ."

"adolescence is a volatile time: both socially and biologically. a lot of profound changes are taking place. it's especially important that once a child hits puberty he or she go back to the doctor for a check-up. it's possible that the physical changes of puberty may mean that your teen's medication needs to be adjusted. a lot of parents find that their teenager wants to stop taking medication. some teens with epilepsy feel like they no longer need epilepsy drugs or they don't want to be controlled by a drug. it's important that you make clear to your teen the risk of stopping medication. teens may need to be reminded what it was like when they had regular seizures. also if they haven't had a seizure in some time point out that the reason may be that their drugs are working. teenage years are often a time when standing out is the last thing a child wants. a lot of kids feel painfully awkward and it can be worse for teenagers with epilepsy. they may be embarrassed by their condition. they may be terrified of having a seizure in public. they may also not like the side effects of their medication which may affect their concentration or their physical appearance. it's important to get any of these concerns checked out with a doctor. it's possible that a change in medicine could ease some of their concerns. depression is a bigger problem among teenagers with epilepsy than previously thought says william r. turk md chief of the neurology division at the nemours children's clinic in jacksonville florida. if you think your child might be depressed it's important to get help. for parents some of the emotional preparation for the teenage years can start early. any parent of a child with epilepsy should work hard to establish a ""climate of trust "" turk says. if you have an open and honest relationship with your child when she's young you may feel more comfortable with her independence as she grows older. on the other hand if you're always isolating your kids or imposing restrictions on them they may be more likely to rebel when they get older."

i also experience pain like yours can't find the reason for it as well after a lot of different scan's blood tests etc very frustating. i have been to a gastroligist and diagnosed me with ibs have been on a fodmaps eating plan and have found some help with the pain gluten seems to be one of the culprits together with lactose look up fodmaps you will find a lot of information. it seems strange but too many fruit and vegetables can actually cause the pain? you could give it a try. it is like your body has an intolerance to specific foods it's finding out what food your body has a problem with. the severity of my pain was nine out of ten doubled up severe pain it is hard to believe food can cause so much extreme pain. i still have pain attacks but not nearly as often as i use to but gluten in particular can be found in cough lollies yogurt ice cream and other foods that you would never guess has gluten in them. this is only a suggestion it has helped me.

"you will probably be fine but it is always wise to use a secondary form of contraception (like condoms) if you are not taking your birth control pills consistently. being a few hours late or early on your daily pill really should not be problematic. it would be your decision to take plan b. i can't make that decision for you. try taking your birth control pills when your brush your teeth in the morning or evening. put a rubber band around your pill pack and insert your toothbrush as a reminder or set your cell phone to remind you daily to ""take your pill""."

assuming you have a 28 day (regular) cycle you'll start your period on day one around day 14 you ovulate - this is when the sperm can fertilize the egg give or take a day or two. if you're bleeding before your period is due it could be implantation bleeding - which is when the fertilized egg (assuming conception worked) is attaching to the wall of the uterus. if it is implantation bleeding it should be light red or brownish in color and only last a day or two at the longest. implantation bleeding occurs 6 - 12 days after conception (having sex). so going off a 28 day cycle that's day 20 - 26. two days later your period would normally come starting the cycle over with day one again.

the treatment of the anemia varies greatly. first the underlying cause of the anemia should be identified and corrected. for example anemia as a result of blood loss from a stomach ulcer should begin with medications to heal the ulcer. likewise surgery is often necessary to remove a colon cancer that is causing chronic blood loss and anemia. sometimes iron supplements will also be needed to correct iron deficiency. in severe anemia blood transfusions may be necessary. vitamin b12 injections will be necessary for patients suffering from pernicious anemia or other causes of b12 deficiency. in certain patients with bone marrow disease (or bone marrow damage from chemotherapy) or patients with kidney failure epoetin alfa (procrit epogen) may be used to stimulate bone marrow red blood cell production. if a medication is thought to be the culprit then it should be discontinued under the direction of the prescribing doctor.

if the redness and itchiness is in the same spot as where you applied the patch this is a common side effect of patches applied to the skin. it is important when you use a patch to rotate the sites of application each day and to try and avoid using the same spot for at least 7 days. this can help curb the local reaction caused by the patch. if it happens every day wherever you apply the patch you could be allergic to one of the ingredients in the patch. you can ask your pharmacist to suggest a different patch or a different method to help you quit smoking if you are allergic to the patch you are using.

so sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds miserable! if you had been taking hormone replacement therapy but went off it some time ago it doesn't seem likely your symptoms are related to lack of estrogen. if on the other hand you stopped hrt relatively recently then your symptoms could indeed be related to a reduction in your female hormone levels. because other health issues can cause the symptoms you describe i'd suggest you visit your primary care provider for an evaluation. he or she may have you get some blood work done to try to determine the cause of your symptoms. i wish you all the best!
"a viral infection should not cause knee pain and stiffness. does he have pain in any other joints? if not he should see an ortopaedic md and have it looked at. he should try to excercise as often as he can by walking. he certainly should not try running as running puts a lot of strain on the knees and the joints of the knees. his knee caps may ""look"" ok but just looking at them isn't enough to tell if he has something more serious possibly needing in the future knee replacement. he should try taking aleve or some otc medication walk as much as he can and consult his physician"
"yes it is possible that you are suffering at least in part from post partum depression. post partum depression can manifest itself in"" just feeling blue and emotionally low"" in a modest to moderate way by having frequent mood swings fits of anger and range or in a very severe manner where feelings of harm to yourself or others may exist. just like any major depressive disorder untreated ppd can last for many months or even years. yes having a husband that works long hours and living in a state with no close family or friends is more than likely also contributing to your unhappy feelings. treatment for depressive disorders including ppd involves talk therapy and medication. i would recommend that you first discuss your feelings of sadness with your husband. if for some reason he cannot be available or be supportive your family doctor or a church official may act as a good sounding board to openly express your sad mood. joining a support group may also generate some insight into your depression and provide you with some positive recommendations. only a doctor or highly trained mental health professional can interrupt your negative symptoms and assign a diagnosis. i admire you for taking the first brave step to recovery by honestly acknowledging your feelings and asking for help on this website. eighteen months is a long time to feel sad and to be unmotivated. you are deserving in feeling worthy in having friendships in having a close bond with your child in being loved cared for and appreciated. feeling chronically sad in a clinical manner is not normal. with appropriate treatment unhappiness can effectively be changed to joy."
i bet that you want to know why since a daily stomachache is problematic. unfortunately since i do not know anything about you your medical history or have any way of examining you or ordering some diagnostic tests you will need to see a medical provider. there is not way for me or any medical provider to be able to blindly diagnose you over the internet based solely on one sentence. sorry. do you have heartburn and/or vomit that comes up but isn't enough to actually vomit? if so it could be gerd or it could even be an allergic reaction to a food you're eating

look for products that are fragrance- and dye-free and designed for baby skin. the words natural and organic may imply that they are more gentle or safer but there are no standards for these in skin care and these products end up being more expensive without necessarily being superior.

"utis are very rare in men (assuming you are male). if you are having unprotected sex and diagnosed with ngu (really this is chlamydia ). all the letters ""ngu"" really mean is that you do not have gonorrhea. hopefully the std clinic ran the appropriate lab tests. urethritis is really an infection or inflammation of the urethra. period. urethritis can have many causes but chlamydia is high on that list. i can't really diagnose you blindly over the internet but your penile rash has nothing to do with urethritis. i don't know what ointment you are using but if it is getting better than good."
"i'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time. what is happening to you is called ""early satiety "" meaning you are getting full early in the eating process. when this happens it's best to see your doctor and describe your symptoms so he or she can run some tests. it could be gastro-intestinal (gi) related such as irritable bowel or gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd) or something else entirely. you need to find out what's going on as you are likely not getting adequate nutrition and no doubt your quality life is suffering. good luck!"

no. vodka added to any drink will not sterilize it.
that depends on what the physician wants to use for their procedure. you can't exactly go in and say i want this particular product. there are two products that is true that are available currently and one does involve taking tablets and they did find that with these particular preparations there is decreased cramping and abdominal discomfort. so therefore patients thought that it wasn't as much of these side-effects and medication was actually easier for them to take. but we want to consider the fact that the physician really makes this choice. they are the ones who are doing the procedure they are the ones that are familiar with which they like better in patients. so i would say to this particular patient sure there are two alternatives one you may not have to drink as much fluid or you may get to take some pills they are i believe they are not the size of horse pills they are tiny pills but we don't get to make that decision. that's up to the healthcare provider or prescribing physician.

well this is an interesting question. i'm not sure there's a straightforward answer because i'm not sure anyone has studied this. here's what we know: smoking around infants and children can cause them to inhale second-hand smoke which may be linked to higher rates of certain lung problems like asthma. we also know second-hand smoke contains harmful chemicals and that this smoke (containing chemicals) can settle on surfaces such as clothing draperies countertops and so on. will coming in contact with this potentially toxic material on someone's shirt (or fingertips) cause problems for your baby? my guess (and it's strictly a guess! ) is probably not. if this were the case the entire baby boomer generation would probably exhibit symptoms because nearly all of our relatives smoked and held babies at the same time. you can reduce any possible risk by gently wiping off your baby with a damp cloth after he or she has been cuddled by someone you believe has tobacco smoke residue on their clothing or hands. you probably don't need to be overly aggressive about this. don't scrub the little one's skin off. but a simple swipe should do the trick. hope this helps!
hi yes i get this kind of smell in the morning and without having sex its just a natural odour we get as guys. but why is your b/f not showing before he come to meet you the first thing any real man does before he sets off for a night of passion is shower so you know your clean for your women. i would tell to shower before he sees you next time its just being healthy for your women so for me at 69 i wash before sex and after just in case you want it again anyway you like then. hope this helps you. good luck

"given the description you could be experiencing mental dependency on narcotics. it doesnÃ¢Â€Â™t seem that you are physically dependent on narcotics currently. in time if you donÃ¢Â€Â™t stop abusing narcotics you may develop physical dependence of the drugs. mental and emotional dependence on drugs is defined as a need for narcotics to achieve pleasure. physically dependent addicts require narcotics to stay alive. you can ask for expert help from a mental health doctor for drug addiction treatment. many former addicts have also found a way to keep the ""mental withdrawal"" in control by joining support groups like narcotics anonymous or alcoholics anonymous. these groups advocate complete lifestyle and belief change in order to recover from addiction. you can visit their websites at www. na. org or www. alcoholics-anonymous. org to look for a meeting near you."
"i'm no expert on wisdom teeth extraction and you certainly have my sympathy on that point by the way. but i think you hit the nail on the head when you mentioned ""swelling. "" gross swelling of the tissue can put pressure on delicate nerves. swelling due to extraction of the widsom teeth might irritate the mandibular nerve and cause temporary tingling or numbness. this type of paresthesia should clear up as the swelling goes down. it's also possible for paresthesia to persist for a few weeks. nerves don't like getting irritated. it can take them awhile to calm back down. only in rare cases is this type of thing permanent. your best bet is to consult the oral surgeon who performed the procedure. he or she will be able to give you information specific to your situation. wishing you well!"
bleaching the skin of your buttocks will not remove acne scars. the only way permanent scarring can be removed would be under the expert services of a cosmetic surgeon which may include chemical peel and/or dermabrasion. i am not sure why you are uncomfortable besides the idea that it may involve some discomfort and the fact that it is your butt exposed to the clinician. see a female provider if you must. i am not sure about the overall safety of bleaching darker pubic or anal skin areas so you should ask the cosmetic medical professional (not the lay person who claims an expertise).
the tsh levels are getting raised due to inconsistent doses of medication that you are taking. so my suggestion is to take doses as advised by your gynaecologist. hope this help.
"well let me start by noting that not all body shaking is caused by a seizure. seizures are caused by abnormal brain signals while other types of involuntary body movement such as tremors may be hereditary and of unknown origin. there also are different types of seizures. some of them involve mild to severe convulsions but some of them merely cause a person to sort of stare off into space for awhile as if they can't hear you. seizures rarely (dare i say ""never"") last up to 20 minutes. most seizures last just a few minutes maybe 3 to 5 minutes or so before they end. if you believe you've had a seizure you should see a doctor for further examination and assessment. it's important to do this because a seizure can be a symptom of another underlying health problem such as in infection. i hope this helps! it is because i am a survivor of one. i have epilepsy from several head injuries and in 2012 minutes after surgery for a lumbar laminectomy i had a documented +30 minute seizure which ended with having a 4 day stay in icu along with scaring a surgeon and a anesthesiologist. even with all the precautions a 6 hour stay ended up with a 4 day camping trip at one of my least favorite places. luckily i don't remember anything except for the usual aura headaches and tiredness after each seizure. what saved my life was communication asking questions and family and doctor support. meds i take: keppra and depakote."
remember that condoms do more than just contain semen so you will not have an unintended pregnancy. condoms help protect against sexually-transmitted disease. if you are 100% sure of the sexual health and fidelity of your partner you will find the implanon to be a highly-effective contraceptive. you are not likely to get pregnant even if this was your sole means of contraception.
i don't understand it either. this is a beta blocker primarily used to lower blood pressure. you would need to ask your doctor for his/her rationale.
most pregnant women will feel some changes in their breasts. your breasts will increase in size as your milk glands enlarge and the fat tissue increases causing breast firmness and tenderness in the first and last few months of pregnancy. bluish veins may also appear as your blood supply increases. your nipples will also darken and a thick fluid called colostrum may leak from your breasts. all of these breast changes are normal. recommendations: wear a bra that provides firm support. choose cotton bras or those made from other natural fibers. increase your bra size as your breasts become larger. your bra should fit well without irritating your nipples. try maternity or nursing bras which provide more support and can be used after pregnancy if you choose to breastfeed. to ease discomfort and maintain support try wearing a bra during the night and day. tuck a cotton handkerchief or gauze pad into each bra cup to absorb leaking fluid. nursing pads which you can buy in a pharmacy are also available. make sure to change these pads as needed to prevent irritation to the underlying skin. clean your breasts with warm water only; do not use soap or other products since they can cause dryness.
maybe. depends on the lab. depends on how much xanax you have been taking and how recent (i am assuming it is non-prescribed correct? ). and if the lab is specifically testing for this class of drug. i know this may be a vague answer but there are just too many unknowns in your brief posting to offer you a more-specific response.

assuming he does not have a history of kidney problems protein shakes can be a part of his diet but not as a substitute for meals (make sure he isn't trying to lose weight to get into a lower weight class). protein shakes will not make him stronger or his muscles bigger in spite of what he hears or reads on the side of the product. excess protein can be a stress on the kidneys so make sure he remains well hydrated and does not exceed the recommended amounts of this product. more is not better.
i've never heard that. people who routinely live in cold temperatures eventually habituate and their bodies get used to it. your blood does not get thicker if you are cold. blood gits thicker if there is an over production of platelets or if there is some other issue with the blood. even in a cold area your body is still somewhere in the neighborhood of 98 degrees because your body burns fuel to keep itself warm. people in ancient japan for example regularly lived in unheated homes with only a charcoal brazier and thick quilts on the bed in winter. they tended to be quite healthy. the human body is amazingly adaptable.
"i'm sorry you experience this. it doesn't sound pleasant that's for sure! whenever a patient describes pain with words like ""jolt of electricity "" we tend to think in terms of nerve pain. only a physical examination and perhaps some testing like x-rays or mri can say for sure what's going on with your neck. that said i would suspect you occasionally pinch a nerve when you turn your head suddenly. this type of neck pain can occur if you have a spinal disc that is slowly collapsing or if you have some arthritis in the vertebrae (spinal bones) of your neck. while i don't think this situation is an emergency i would suggest you get this checked out by a health care provider soon. catching spine problems early usually results in a better outcome. you can start with a visit to your primary care provider and he or she can get the ball rolling. hope this helps! i do that all the time. even in bed. go see a chiropractor! i wouldn't want to live without one since i started seeing one. usually a quick adjustment to the neck is all it takes. also ice packs to the area help with the pain. this is a case cevical spondylitis which mean iflamation of the cervical spine i am a yoga guru in india. been in the field for 12 yrs. i also have been suffering from arthritis for some time in the neck hands and low back. believe me i am not taking any medicine. i have been able to manage only with yogaanasas yoga nidra or corpe pose. you have to learn from an expert and not self learn. it is a good pain reliever. my website is srimadhwayoga. com yoga guru i have had this exact pain since i was a little girl (5 or 6). im now 18. i used to go to doctors all the time and no one ever knew what to do. it hasnt happened for about 3 years but it is now happening monthly. did you have any luck finding out what is causing this pain?"
"recovery from spinal fusion surgery takes longer than with other types of spinal surgery. patients often have a 3- or 4-day hospital stay, with a possible stay on a rehabilitation unit. patients typically wear a brace immediately after surgery. rehabilitation is often necessary to rebuild strength and functioning. activity level is gradually increased. depending on the patient's age and health status, getting back to normal functioning can happen within 2 months, or up to 6 months later."

"the most recognizable symptom of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is a feeling of a rapid, fluttering heartbeat. you also might:"
we know aspirin interferes with blood clotting so people go off aspirin for some period of time. but often patients dont know that some of the other medications they are taking without a prescription again or even with prescription may interfere. so we have a list of over 200 medications over the counter and prescription that are known to contain elements that would interfere with blood clotting and we give it to the patient well in advance of the surgery and say look through this list and if youre taking any of these please stop or lets talk about. and we ask very specifically on our questionnaires what medicines are you taking both prescription medications and non-prescription medications. we are trying to make sure the patient doesnt forget or doesnt disregard the importance of these medications that could interfere by the way not only with the bleeding but even with the anesthesia. there are certain drugs that the anesthesiologist would be very unhappy if he didnt know the patient were taking. but its not just supplements and prescriptions. what about foods? well garlic and ginger for example when consumed in large amounts can cause some change in clotting yeah so we tell people about it. we tell people those things that would get them into trouble. by the way foods can also help us though because papaya and pineapple rich in an enzyme called papase which is the same thing that is in meat tenderizer after surgery very good because they help digest the red cells that cause bruising. when you see a bruise its because the red cells in the blood have seeped into the tissues and it helps digest them. so you know foods can work for us and they can also work against us. but we need to know. this is the most important thing. and this is why its so important to have a very complete evaluation by the cosmetic surgeon a very complete evaluation by your personal doctor so that none of these things would slip through the cracks. we dont want anything slipping through the cracks. an anesthesiologists worst nightmare is that the patient took a drug that the anesthesiologist didnt know about and that drug was in the patients system and could interfere sometimes significantly with a safe anesthetic.

i am sorry for your daughter's illness. i know that it is a scary time for you and your family. the waiting period is the worst and should end soon. it sounds like she may have hepatitis a. hepatitis a is primarily contracted by eating or drinking contaminated food or beverages containing the hepatitis a virus. the news is essentially positive in that treatment usually consists of 3 months or so of bed rest with most people making a full recovery within 6 months. it also seems that the doctors are appropriately covering all bases by asking a surgeon to review the mri results. yes the viewing of some undistinguishable object next to the liver is worrisome but it could end up being a benign and non-issue. at this time it is difficult not knowing the complete results of the mri for your precious daughter. based upon her young age having a supportive mother and doctors that are investigating all possibilities i'm rooting for and predicting a positive outcome.
benadryl or diphenhydramine is an antihistamine used to aid with sleep because it makes people drowsy. taking benadryl every night alone should be all right depending on other medications that you may be taking. keep in mind a few things. while benadryl is over the counter for self-treatment it is for temporary relief. if sleep issues continue you many want to look into lifestyle modifications and consult your health-care provider. be careful when taking benadryl with other antihistamines such as claritin zyrtec and other prescription medications. additive side effects will occur such as constipation; diarrhea; dizziness; drowsiness; dry mouth nose or throat; excitability (especially in children); headache; loss of appetite; nausea; nervousness; restlessness; trouble sleeping; vomiting.

upset stomach is not likely a side effect from the cortisone injection. but cortisone can cause flushing or swelling of the skin. do not be alarmed. this side effect will probably subside. however if you itch if redness appears or if you have difficulty breathing seek medical advice to make sure you are not having an allergic reaction to the injection. if any of these symptoms becomes unbearable seek advice from your health care professional or your local pharmacist.
it would be safer and more appropriate to just have a surgical sterilization (tubal ligation) or have your husband get a vasectomy. you bore four children so perhaps it is his turn to help. you can not just request that your uterus be removed just for contraception. there has to be a true medical reason or insurance will not cover it and surgeons will not do it.

"i'm sorry you're going through this. it sounds uncomfortable and unsettling. keep pursuing this situation with your physician. sometimes swelling of the lower limbs is caused by simple things like too much salt consumption or having a job that requires you to be on your feet all day (like a nurse for example. ) but other times swollen legs and feet can be a symptom of something more serious like congestive heart failure. because you state you feel fatigued you are considered ""symptomatic. "" in other words you're not just experiencing swollen feet with no other complaints (""asymptomatic""). and any time a patient has at least one sign (swelling) plus symptoms fatigue) it deserves to be investigated. if possible go back to your doctor as soon as you can. if nothing else call your doctor's nurse and explain how you're feeling. they will give you guidance on what to do. wishing you well!"

yes that can happen. it happened to me. if the prescription or prism (assuming you have one in your glasses) is incorrect even in one lens this can cause dizziness. if the glasses are progressive lens bifocals or trifocals this can also cause visual disturbances that are interpreted by your brain as dizziness. there can be hundreds of different causes of dizziness but your first step is to take your glasses back to check your prescription and fitting. if everything is perfect then you will need to see your medical provider so other causes of dizziness can be investigated.

"i have no way of confirming or disputing this chiropractor's diagnosis but i do have issues with the treatment plan. degeneration by definition is ""wear and tear often due to aging"". i don't believe it is possible to reverse aging by chiropractic adjustments but then again i am not a chiropractor who believes in those things. before mortgaging your house see an orthopedist for a medical opinion and have some imaging studies read by a radiologist. i think you will find a different perspective on your neck and low back issues"

typhus refers to a family of diseases spread through the bites of lice fleas ticks and other insects. there are several versions of typhus which are very different diseases: epidemic typhus is rare worldwide today and extremely rare in the u. s. in this country flying squirrels can carry the louse that transmits epidemic typhus. infection in people is almost unheard of. scrub typhus is an ongoing problem in asia and part of australia. people catch scrub typhus through the bite of a chigger which injects a tiny mite that carries bacteria that cause the illness. murine typhus is spread by fleas carried on rats and is present in the u. s. its possible for outdoor pets (cats and dogs) to encounter those fleas and bring them inside. murine typhus might occur regularly in texas and california; the exact rate isnt known. common symptoms of typhus include: fever headache rapid breathing muscle aches rash if untreated epidemic and scrub typhus can be severe or life-threatening. murine typhus is almost always mild and goes away on its own; it may go undiagnosed or be misdiagnosed as a viral infection. if you live in the u. s. typhus should be near the bottom of the list of health threats to worry about. avoiding rats and keeping pets indoors and treated against fleas and ticks should almost eliminate the risk of serious illness. typhus is usually curable with antibiotics once it is recognized or suspected. people traveling to parts of asia where scrub typhus is widespread may benefit from taking antibiotics for prevention.
"if you have symptoms of a herpes outbreak even if mild there is a risk of transmitting the infection to your partner. in fact even if you don't have a herpes outbreak you could transmit the infection to your partner. whether you have an outbreak is not a reliable way to prevent transmitting infection. even people on medication can transmit infection  even with no outbreak. the best way to help prevent infection is to always use a condom. here's a study from january that further explains. hope that helps. it needs to be added to the doctors answer that if you have blisters anywhere on your private area that is not used for ""sex"" a condom will not help. example: if you have blisters on the bend of your leg or tip of your butt cheek a condom isnt going to help. whatever you do. no matter what. do not ever have sex with someone if you know you have herpes without telling your partner. you might think you are safe but in fact you could spread it. you will be shocked how many people have herpes. you will be shocked how your partner reacts if they care about you. heck you might be shocked on what they confess to you."
these are not medications that should be stopped abruptly. zoloft in particular needs to be tapered to avoid potentially serious side effects such as suicidal feelings. zoloft normally is used to treat depression. therefore stopping zoloft can allow depressive symptoms to return. focalin normally is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd). stopping it can cause adhd symptoms to be uncontrolled. if you are the 17-year-old in question i suggest you participate in decision that affect your health. ask your parents to make an appointment with the doctor so you can discuss the pros and cons of taking these medications. you of all people need to understand why you're taking the medications what the potential side effects are and how long the therapy is expected to last. if you are the parent of the 17-year-old try to involve your teen in the medical decision-making process. individuals who feel empowered tend to take more responsibility for their medication regimens than those who feel medications are being forced upon them. as i said under no circumstances should zoloft be abruptly withdrawn. this can cause serious negative consequences. wishing you well!
running (and anxiety) increased epinephrine (adrenaline) that will speed up your heart. because you are so concerned i would strongly suggest that you see a cardiologist and undergo an exercise stress test. an ekg while you are running an a treadmill. this test will show if you are showing any signs of an irregular heart rhythm or other exercise-related cardiac problems.
doctors can often easily recognize ringworm when there is a distinct ringworm -patterned rash. your doctor will probably also look at a hair or skin sample (koh preparation) under a microscope to determine whether a fungus is present. tests used for ringworm of the scalp or beard include: a koh (potassium hydroxide) preparation which your doctor can use to find out whether the skin condition is caused by a fungus. a fungal culture ( skin culture ) which your doctor usually will do only if diagnosis is difficult or the skin condition is not responding to treatment. the test results may take 4 to 6 weeks. early detection if someone in your family has ringworm of the scalp or beard talk to your doctor about whether other family members should be examined. it is quite common for one family member to spread the fungus to other family members. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

treatment for migraines includes therapies that may or may not involve medication. nonmedication therapies for migraine therapy that does not involve medications can provide symptomatic and preventative therapy. using ice biofeedback and relaxation techniques may be helpful at stopping an attack once it has started. if possible sleep is the best medicine. preventing migraine takes motivation for the patient to make some life changes. patients are educated as to triggering factors that can be avoided. these include smoking cessation avoiding certain foods especially those high in tyramine (sharp cheeses) or those containing sulphites (wines) or nitrates (nuts processed meats). generally leading a healthy lifestyle with good nutrition adequate fluid intake sufficient sleep and exercise may be useful. acupuncture has been suggested to be a useful nonmedication therapy. medication therapies for migraine individuals with occasional mild migraine headaches that do not interfere with daily activities usually medicate themselves with over-the-counter (otc nonprescription) pain relievers (analgesics). many otc analgesics are available. otc analgesics have been shown to be safe and effective for short-term relief of headache (as well as muscle aches pains menstrual cramps and fever) when used according to the instructions on their labels. there are two major classes of otc analgesics: acetaminophen (tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids). the two types of nsaids are aspirin and nonaspirin. examples of nonaspirin nsaids are ibuprofen (advil nuprin motrin ib and medipren) and naproxen (aleve). aspirin acetaminophen and caffeine also are available combined in otc analgesics for the treatment of headaches. examples of such combination analgesics are pain-aid excedrin fioricet and fiorinal. finding an effective analgesic or analgesic combination often is a process of trial and error because individuals respond differently to different analgesics. in general a person should use the analgesic that has worked in the past. this will increase the likelihood that an analgesic will be effective and decrease the risk of side effects. there are several precautions that should be observed with otc analgesics: children and teenagers should not use aspirin for the treatment of headaches other pain or fever because of the risk of developing reye's syndrome a life-threatening neurological disease that can lead to coma and even death. patients with balance disorders or hearing difficulties should avoid using aspirin because aspirin may aggravate these conditions. patients taking blood thinners such as warfarin (coumadin) should not take aspirin and nonaspirin nsaids without a doctor's supervision because they add further to the risk of bleeding that is caused by the blood thinner. patients with active ulcers of the stomach and duodenum should not take aspirin and nonaspirin nsaids because they can increase the risk of bleeding from the ulcer and impair healing of the ulcer. patients with advanced liver disease should not take aspirin and nonaspirin nsaids because they may impair kidney function. deterioration of kidney function in these patients can lead to kidney failure. patients should not overuse otc or prescription analgesics. overuse of analgesics can lead to the development of tolerance (increasing ineffectiveness of the analgesic) and rebound headaches (return of the headache as soon as the effect of the analgesic wears off usually in the early morning hours). thus overuse of analgesics can lead to a vicious cycle of more and more analgesics for headaches that respond less and less to treatment.

"most helpful answer i guess that would depend on the scope of practice for each one. many primary care providers are not that keen on providing gynecological care (assuming your ob days are over) and some ob-gyns are not crazy about handling your depression or dealing with hundreds of other non-gynecological problems that a woman might develop. if you had to pick one pick the primary care provider but consider finding one that has hospital privileges if that is important to you. many hospitals now use ""hospitalists"" that take over your case once you are admitted so not having hospital privileges may not be a big problem. talk to them both about your situation and you will see where they stand."
well first i'm obligated to note that marijuana smoking is illegal under u. s. federal law even in states that regulate the use of medical marijuana. but as to your question: there shouldn't be any conflict between cannabis use and vicodin (hydrocodone). cannabis is not an opioid the way hydrocodone is. both substances provide mild pain relief so if anything cannabis might make you feel as if the pain relieving effect of the hydrocodone is enhanced. that said it's generally not a good idea to mix drugs with similar properties (such as pain relievers). so your best bet is to avoid smoking marijuana while taking hydrocodone. the hydrocodone should provide sufficient pain relief on its own. if it doesn't please contact your health care provider for a different pain reliever. there are plenty to choose from! hope this helps!
hi this is the information from your packet seems you did not read it. if this is the first time you are using this medication and you are not switching from another form of hormonal birth control (such as patch other birth control pills) take the first tablet in the pack on the first sunday following the beginning of your menstrual period or on the first day of your period. if your period begins on a sunday begin taking this medication on that day. for the first cycle of use only use an additional form of non-hormonal birth control (such as condoms spermicide) for the first 7 days to prevent pregnancy until the medication has enough time to work. if you start on the first day of your period you do not need to use back-up birth control the first week. if you have not read this as you can see you should have started on the first day of what would have been your next period you started a week early. and this is a serious answer. good luck
you should not be able to get strep while on amoxicillin since this drug is used for strep. you can however get a viral sore throat or even mono while taking antibiotics.
before making any recommendations i would really need some additional information about your daughter and the medications she is using. . it is unlikely that a medication for impetigo or an eye drop medicine would interfere with any over-the-counter fever reducers. so it is likely to be fine. i would suggest you ask your pharmacist to recommend a medication to reduce your daughter's fever based on her age weight and the other medications she's taking.
hi abnormal cytology findings and intra epithelial neoplasia grade 2. are findings of early stages of malignancy and indicate cervical cancer. you should get a further evaluation done to find out whether it has spread in the pelvis or in the body. it seems to be in a early stage and curable. consult a oncologist and get immediate treatment. thanks
poison ivy on the skin is not contagious. it will not spread from one area to another even it if is touched nor will it spread to another person. it can seem to spread since areas with more exposure out first and areas that were lightly exposed may break out days later. assuming that the skin has be washed to remove the original plant oil it will not spead. it is the plant oil that is the problem not any oozing from the skin lesions. it does not need to be wrapped but you can cover it lightly to keep the drainage contained.
ask your ob doctor since most set their own rules and parameters for their patients. as a rule raw seafood (including oysters) would not be recommended due to the possibility of getting a food-borne disease or parasite while you were pregnant.

i am glad you raised this question. bupropion is the generic or chemical name of the drug and budeprion and wellbutrin are brand names. drugs can have both a generic name and a brand name. the fda released a statement that the brand named medication; budeprion xl 300 mg is not therapeutically equivalent to the brand named medication wellbutrin xl 300 mg. this means that these two versions of bupropion xl 300 mg do not work the same when given to patients. when a suffix or ending is attached to a drug that refers to how often it is taken. bupropion xl (extended release) is taken once daily; bupropion sr (sustained release) and is taken twice daily; and bupropion 300 mg (immediate release) is taken 3 times daily. the fda statement pertained only to the xl 300 mg dose. when brand named medications lose their patents different manufacturers can make their version or the medication can be marketed under the generic name. generic and brand named drugs should contain the exact same active drug and have the same dosage intended use action side effects risks and safety. the difference between generics and different brands of the same drug is that they may vary in the inactive components. these inactive components include dyes and fillers. the fda does studies to make sure that all the different brands and generic formulations are the same. the fda did the studies on the dose of bupropion xl 150 mg and concluded that all the manufacturers were making equivalent medications. the fda did not study the 300 mg dose but assumed the 300 mg would be just as good. due to complaints from patients the fda finally studied the 300 mg dose and found that the budeprion and the wellbutrin version of bupropion xl 300 mg were not the same. there was a difference in the rate to which they were released into the blood stream. there are ongoing studies on the manufacturers of other versions of bupropion xl 300 mg. some physicians feel that the differences in the inactive components of a drug do influence the availability of a drug to the target tissue (bioavailability). this difference is not usually felt to be clinically significant. talk to your doctor about your use of bupropion to determine whether the formulation you are using is the right one for you.
yes it can or at least i have on that medication. i am also hungry and just down right mean.
aerobic exercise and resistance training are both beneficial for diabetes and lower the hemoglobin a1c levels. structured exercise programs typically produce better results than exercise advice simply because the structured exercise programs achieve greater intensity and duration and greater compliance than when patients are left to their own devices to get the recommended exercise. in fact studies with exercise advice typically produced no improvement in the hemoglobin a1c (due to poor compliance) unless dietary improvements were also made. the best combination is always simultaneous dietary improvement plus exercise (cardio and/or resistance) and the more structured or formalized the better. in fact while patients who achieve the standard recommended 2. 5 hours per week see greater improvements in hemoglobin a1c than those who do not meet this standard; those patients who exceed the standard get even greater improvements!
yes it's possible to have a period even if you're pregnant. if you are at least 10 to 14 days late for your period you can take a pregnancy test. home pregnancy tests are very accurate. in fact some pregnancy tests may even detect pregnancy on the first day of your missed period. hi well the thing is time will tell but if not don't try and put to much pressure on you and your guy. the thing is to put it to the back of your mind don't count the days just enjoy your love making give it time and it will happen. but if you have not been long of the pill then just weight if you were on depo shot then even longer could be up to a year. the thing is relax and enjoy life it will happen. good luck

well the symptoms of ebv commonly subside in 2-3 weeks but fatigue can last for 2-3 months and in very few cases can even last for about one year. so the symptoms can be lingering from ebv infection only. but i would also suggest you to get a blood culture done to rule out for any other infections. a cbp +esr should also be done.

last year the obama administration issued new rules that prohibit group health-insurance plans â€” typically offered by employers â€” from restricting access to care by limiting mental-health benefits and requiring higher patient costs than those that apply to general medical or surgical benefits. the rules implement the paul wellstone and pete domenici mental health parity and addiction equity act of 2008 (mhpaea). in other words the mhpaea states that a group health plan may not impose annual or lifetime dollar limits on mental-health benefits that are less favorable than any such limits imposed on medical surgical benefits. the affordable care act also takes steps to help people access the mental health services they need: right now if you havent been able to find health insurance due to a pre-existing mental-health condition you may be able to access the new pre-existing condition insurance plan. starting in 2014 substance abuse or mental illness can no longer be used by insurers to deny coverage as a pre-existing condition â€“ and insurers also wont be able to use those conditions to raise your premiums. also in 2014 mental-health and substance-use disorder services will be part of the essential benefits package a set of health-care service categories that must be covered by certain plans including all insurance policies that will be offered through the exchanges and most coverage in medicaid. these reforms all work to make the health-insurance marketplace a more accessible affordable place for people with mental-health and substance-abuse disorders.

there are a number of ways to treat gallstones though most gallstones are silent. if silent gallstones are discovered in someone age 65 or older the chance of developing symptoms from the gallstones is only 20%(or less assuming a life span of 75 years. in this instance it is reasonable not to treat the individual. among younger people no treatment also might be appropriate if they have serious lifethreatening diseases  for example serious heart disease  that are likely to shorten their life span. on the other hand in healthy young people treatment should be considered even for silent gallstones because the chances of developing symptoms from the gallstones over a lifetime is higher. once symptoms begin treatment should be recommended since further symptoms are likely and more serious complications can be prevented. cholecystectomy cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder surgically) is the standard treatment for gallstones in the gallbladder. surgery may be done through a large abdominal incision or laparoscopically through small punctures of the abdominal wall. laparoscopic surgery results in less pain and a faster recovery. cholecystectomy has a low rate of complications but serious complications such as damage to the bile ducts and leakage of bile occasionally occur. there also is risk associated with the general anesthesia that is necessary for either type of surgery. problems following removal of the gallbladder are few. digestion is not affected and no change in diet is necessary. chronic diarrhea occurs in approximately 10% of patients. sphincterotomy and extraction of gallstones sometimes a gallstone may be stuck in the hepatic or common bile ducts. in such situations there usually are gallstones in the gallbladder as well and cholecystectomy is necessary. it may be possible to remove the gallstone stuck in the duct at the time of surgery but this may not always be possible. another way to remove gallstones in the duct before or after cholecystectomy is with sphincterotomy followed by extraction of the gallstone. sphincterotomy involves cutting the muscle of the common bile duct (sphincter) at the junction of the common bile duct and the duodenum in order to allow easier access to the common bile duct. the cutting is done with an electrosurgical instrument passed through the same type of endoscope that is used for ercp. after the sphincter is cut instruments may be passed through the endoscope and up into the hepatic and common bile ducts to grab and pull out the gallstone or to crush the gallstone. it also is possible to pass a lithotripsy instrument that uses high-frequency sound waves to break up the gallstone. complications of sphincterotomy and extraction of gallstones include the general anesthesia perforation of the bile ducts or duodenum bleeding and pancreatitis. oral dissolution therapy it is possible to dissolve some cholesterol gallstones with medication taken orally. the medication is a naturally-occurring bile acid called ursodeoxycholic acid or ursodiol (actigall urso). bile acids are one of the detergents that the liver secretes into bile to dissolve cholesterol. ursodiol reduces the amount of cholesterol secreted in bile. the bile then has less cholesterol and becomes capable of dissolving the cholesterol in the gallstones. there are important limitations to the use of ursodiol: it is only effective for cholesterol gallstones and not pigment gallstones. it works only for small gallstones less than 1 centimeter-1. 5 centimeter in diameter. it takes one to two years for the gallstones to dissolve and many of the gallstones reform following cessation of treatment. due to these limitations ursodiol generally is used only in people with smaller gallstones that are likely to have a very high cholesterol content and who are at high risk for surgery because of ill health. it also is reasonable to use ursodiol in people whose gallstones were likely to have formed because of a transient event for example rapid loss of weight since the gallstones would not be expected to recur following successful dissolution. extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (eswl) is an infrequently used method for treating gallstones particularly those lodged in bile ducts. eswl generators produces shock waves outside of the body that are then focused on the gallstone. the shock waves shatter the gallstone and the resulting pieces of the gallstone either drain into the intestine on their own or are extracted endoscopically as in sphincterotomy.

no. the flu vaccine in shot form is not a live vaccine. you cannot spread influenza from the shot nor can you spread a disease you do not currently have. no you cannot spread the virus by sneezing or with close contact for which you are immunized.
"that's a good question. i can see why you might make that connection since both cystic fibrosis (cf) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) involve the lungs. cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease that causes mucus throughout the body to become thick and sticky. this becomes very evident in the lungs where there's a lot of mucus. in order to get cf a child must inherit a gene defect from both parents. if only one parent passes along the gene mutation that causes cf the child is called a cf ""carrier"" because if he or she has a child with another person who is a cf carrier their child will have cystic fibrosis. if you are a cf carrier you do not have the disease and cannot get the disease. cf is not in any way related to copd which is usually caused by external factors such as smoking tobacco. copd is not an inherited disease and cannot be ""caught"" from another person. copd is not in any way related to  or associated with  carrying the cystic fibrosis gene mutation. if a cystic fibrosis carrier develops copd this is in no way related to the person's genetic status and the cf gene mutation in no way affects the individual's copd. wishing you well!"
hi you need to know the cause of fibromalgia in order to control it do kidney profile full blood electrolytes (magnesium zinc calcium/phosphorus) also do a full antibody profile test for auto immune disease stronger drugs can be prescribed but they are dangerous you need to be under supervision before taking them like epicotil good luck
maybe but you will need to address this problem with your baby's pediatrician  someone who knows her and her medical history. this issue is always a challenge for parents traveling with babies. some have used benadryl but i am not a big fan of doing this since this medication which will make adults sleepy can result in a paradoxical effect in children. in other words it could cause her to be stimulated like you gave her coffee! you do not want a wild and stimulated baby on a nine hour flight. talk to the pediatrician.
the goal of psoriatic arthritis treatment is to control inflammation stop joint destruction and maximize joint function. skin symptoms and joint symptoms are usually treated at the same time. the initial treatment for psoriatic arthritis often includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) such as ibuprofen or naproxen (advil excedrin ib motrin). nsaids can provide long-term relief from the chronic pain and inflammation of psoriatic arthritis. there are many different nsaids. sometimes you must try several nsaids before you find the safest and most effective one for you.
"a diagnosis of hypothyroidism can be suspected in patients with fatigue cold intolerance constipation and dry flaky skin. a blood test is needed to confirm the diagnosis. when hypothyroidism is present the blood levels of thyroid hormones can be measured directly and are usually decreased. however in early hypothyroidism the level of thyroid hormones (t3 and t4) may be normal. therefore the main tool for the detection of hyperthyroidism is the measurement of tsh the thyroid stimulating hormone. tsh is secreted by the pituitary gland. if a decrease of thyroid hormone occurs the pituitary gland reacts by producing more tsh and the blood tsh level increases in an attempt to encourage thyroid hormone production. this increase in tsh can actually precede the fall in thyroid hormones by months or years. thus the measurement of tsh should be elevated in cases of hypothyroidism. however there is one exception. if the decrease in thyroid hormone is actually due to a defect of the pituitary or hypothalamus then the levels of tsh are abnormally low. this kind of thyroid disease is known as ""secondary"" or ""tertiary"" hypothyroidism. a special test known as the trh test can help distinguish if the disease is caused by a defect in the pituitary or the hypothalamus. this test requires an injection of the trh hormone and is performed by an endocrinologist (hormone specialist). blood work confirms the diagnosis of hypothyroidism but does not point to an underlying cause. a combination of the patient's clinical history antibody screening and a thyroid scan can help diagnose the precise underlying thyroid problem more clearly. if a pituitary or hypothalamic cause is suspected an mri of the brain and other studies may be warranted. these investigations should be made on a case-by-case basis."

i do not know of a mechanism by which allergic reactions would lead to hearing loss.
herpes would not be high on a diagnostic list based on what you have described. while it would be impossible to blindly offer you a definitive answer without examining you more likely possibilities would include chaffing (like you mentioned) or a fungal skin infection (tinea cruris also known as jock itch)  a common skin condition that occurs in warm dark moist skin areas. you would need to see a medical provider if this condition persists or worsens. this is really the only way to be properly diagnosed and treated.

yes this would be called viral conjunctivitis. however when it is only affecting one eye with purulent discharge i would be suspicious of a secondary bacterial component. this is just a guess however since i have no way of seeing your eye first-hand. many times it is difficult to tell even during an examination so many medical providers will just treat it with topical ophthalmic antibiotic ointments or drops. it may clear up on its own. it may spread to the other eye or to others in your family or work so having a prescription eye medication would nice. many medical offices will simply call it in for you if you ask.
thanks so much. we are waiting on the dr. to call us back. originally his pediatrician said not to cover that by covering it could build moisture and make a breeding ground for more fungus. they said there was no reason to have to cover that after 24 hours of using cream it was no longer contagious. he has been going to school with it uncovered for a month and they just now are telling us to cover it.
sperm producing cells in the testicles are very heat sensitive which is why a human male's testicles are in the bottom of the scrotum. when cold they pull in tight. when hot they relax and pull away. the thin wrinkled skin of the scrotum also allows for rapid heat dissipation like radiator fins on a car or air conditioning unit. the type of underwear you wear makes no difference in many studies. hot tubs are indeed bad for fertility but only for the few months after until you can make new sperm (the sperm production cycle is 74 to 90 days long). i tell my fertility and vasectomy reversal patients to avoid hot tubs hot baths jacuzzis or hot saunas.
co. if the intravenous thrombolytic and antibiotic treatments has failed then this embolization procedure might be considered as a treatment of choice i do not believe that the procedure may have such complications. unless you are still having problems with blood clotting factors and a high risk of developing deep venous thrombus or other thrombi at any part of your body i recommend doing clotting factor test blood test inr and ecg and visiting a cardiologist to rule out any related pathologies as soon as possible
if tuberculosis bacteria are found in the sputum (phlegm) the diagnosis of tb can be made in a day or two but this finding will not be able to distinguish between drug-susceptible (regular) tb and drug-resistant tb. to determine drug susceptibility the bacteria need to be grown and tested in a laboratory. final diagnosis for tb and especially for extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (xdr) may take from six to 16 weeks.
getting rid of bed bugs is not an easy process and most cases of bed bug infestation will require treatment by a pest-control expert. a variety of low-odor sprays dusts and aerosol insecticides can be used to eradicate bed bugs. these must be applied to all areas where the bugs are observed as well as spaces where they may crawl or hide. the pest-control company can help you determine if the mattress can be disinfected or must be discarded. since beds cannot readily be treated with insecticides it's often necessary to discard infested mattresses and beds. the pest-control expert may recommend certain forms of deep-cleaning such as scrubbing infested surfaces with a stiff brush to remove eggs dismantling bed frames and furniture filling cracks in floors walls and moldings encasing mattresses within special bags or using a powerful vacuum on cracks and crevices.

sepsis is not contagious but the microorganism is capable of being transferred in many ways. exposure does not necessarily mean that you will develop anything since our body is usually quite skilled at fighting off these attacks. how in the world are you getting urine splashed in your eye from someone else? you need to step back a bit.
baby formula water? i can't say that any of my little patients are using special water to mix the formula. i see nothing wrong with mixing the formula with any bottled water. just buy a gallon of purified drinking water leave it at room temperature and use that. or use your water cooler water to fill up a jug so it gets to room temperature before you give it to the baby. i don't think they would appreciate ice water! i don't know the quality of your city water (some cities have excellent water).

possibly a allergic reaction or maybe a med interference. i have never been able to get any over the counter migraine meds to work besides excederine tension and i was put on fioricet which helped. i would say a different ingredient whether inactive or active is in the off brand. nothing really compares to the original.
it could be the lotion. even though it's meant to moisturize an inexpensive lotion can contain alcohol and other drying chemicals and some of these substances can cause dermatitis or allergic reactions. keep in mind too that a lotion is actually meant to be absorbed so it doesn't really do the trick as a lube. you're better off using a water-based personal lubricant meant for the purpose and you can follow up when you're done by washing and then applying a penis health creme (health professionals recommend man1 man oil) to soothe moisturize and rejuvenate the skin.
"based on my experience over the years i think fm makes our muscles more susceptible to strains or tears/injuries within the muscles. also we seem to be more susceptible to getting tendinitis and bursitis. some of this may be due to certain deficiencies that we with fibro develop like low intracellular magnesium levels low muscle energy (atp) and low growth hormone levels that interfere with the protection flexibility and recovery of the muscles and soft tissues. our soft tissues may be more susceptible to the degenerative ""wear and tear"" changes we all get with aging and overuse. also our muscles act more ""deconditioned"" when we have fm which increases our chance of an injury. fm doesn't cause/aggravate disc disease or arthritis changes but the reverse situation is true. that is disc and arthritic disease can aggravate fm symptoms. i don't believe in automatically attributing any soft tissue problem to fm. in fact most of the times something else like a trauma or a degenerative problem is ""clearly"" identified as the direct cause of the tear or bursitis/tendinitis. but we can surmise that the fm probably played a secondary role in a lot of these situations. no i dont believe so"

hi if you tested negative to hepatitis then you should explore other possibility like g6pd deficiency or thalassemia intermedia in my opinion it is g6pd deficiency are your kids boys? if a mother have g6pd deficiency she can pass it to her boys yes you can have it from birth and not show up until recent medication or infection. good luck
"i have to tell you that the ""stomach flu"" is not influenza. influenza is a respiratory disease not a gastrointestinal disease so tamiflu will not help as you have experienced. tamiflu only works for influenza not other viral infections. what you most likely had was viral gastroenteritis - a viral infection that is unrelated to true influenza. viral gastroenteritis is a self-limiting disease lasting about a week. i am assuming that you did not have a nasal swab (rapid flu test) to diagnose your illness. unless you actually had a flu vaccine to prevent influenza you would still be considered ""at-risk"" for getting the true influenza. it is not too late to get a vaccine but it will not help you for about two weeks. keep that in mind when you are exposed to large groups of people."
obesity has been identified as an independent risk factor for ui [urinary incontinence) and urgency and frequency in many studies. the incontinence seen in obesity may be related to increased weight causing more pressure on the bladder and urethra. weight loss even just a decrease of 5% of your weight may improve or eliminate your bladder issues.

i would not recommend she take sudafed pe with adderall. these two medications can be too stimulating in combination. sudafed pe is for congestion. it does not treat allergies. for allergies she would be better off using an antihistamine which will treat her allergies without causing drowsiness and is safe to take with adderall. you should always talk to your pharmacist before taking any over-the-counter medication so they can help you choose the best one for your symptoms.
your condition sounds quite challenging. boils all over the body may be secondary to an altered immune system an opportunistic staph infection or a hereditary condition of the sweat glands referred to as hidradenitis suppurativa. your first step is to undergo a complete examination by your internist including a comprehensive blood panel to determine if there are any underlying medical causes for your skin changes.

lice are very easily spread usually through close personal contact. lice infestation may be caused by any of the three types of lice: head lice may be spread through close personal contact shared personal items (combs brushes hats helmets clothing or earphones) or shared bedding. pubic lice are spread mainly through sexual contact and are very contagious. most people become infected after a single exposure to an infected person. but the lice and eggs may survive long enough on personal items such as clothing or towels to be spread to another person. a child diagnosed with pubic lice may have a history of sexual abuse. body lice are most often spread by contact with personal items especially clothing and hats. they are occasionally spread by direct personal contact. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

"no i wouldn't recommend wet wipes or anything like that for treating pinkeye. conjunctivitis is also called ""pinkeye"" and refers to inflammation (redness and swelling) of the membranes that surround the eye. usually conjunctivitis makes the white part of the eye look bloodshot and the lower lid may appear swollen. you may experience burning itching and drainage from the eye too. if you think you or your child might have pinkeye you should see a health care provider as soon as possible. there are different types of conjunctivitis some that do well with treatment. also conjunctivitis is highly contagious so you or your child should not go to school or work until the cause has been determined. be sure to wash your hands often and thoroughly if you have pinkeye. baby wipes antibacterial wipes and wet wipes should never be used around the eye. to get rid of the ""gunk"" (drainage) that often goes along with pinkeye use a wash cloth or paper towel soaked with lukewarm water and gently clean the outer eye area. cool compresses may help with the burning and itching. symptoms of pinkeye usually go away within a week. if you still have symptoms after a week it's time for a trip back to the doctor. hope this helps! sorry you're feeling miserable."
serotonin is one of a few chemicals that may be low in depression but depression may be due to genetics stress and your personality or coping style. some of us think that psychotherapy actually exercises the front of the brain which helps to increase many of the chemicals that are low. so psychotherapy changes chemical levels too perhaps. if counseling has routinely helped you keep doing it. if it fails to help then a med may be called for. unfortunately i see that the more depression spells someone has then often they do end up on a med more often.

hi. getting the dressing changed in a 7 days time can itself be a cause of infection at the site of surgery so it will be better to get it changed daily or atleast every alternate day. you can change it on your own only if you have the expertise to follow proper aseptic precautions. it will be better that as of now first you should go to your surgeon and get the dressing changed and if not possible you can consult an emergency service. if placed properly it will not come off on its own. hope this helps.
although the exact cause of celiac disease is not known having certain genes increases your risk. you are more likely to have these genes and may get celiac disease if you have a first-degree relative (mother father brother sister son or daughter) with the condition. environmental factors such as viral or bacterial infections may trigger changes in the small intestine of a person with these genes. then eating foods that contain gluten can trigger an abnormal immune system response. eventually digestion and absorption problems may result. research continues on how genetic environmental and immune factors interact and affect a person's symptoms at what age they begin and whether long-term health problems develop. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

i agree with you. testing him for strep would have been prudent although he was not experiencing a severe sore throat. there can be other reasons (intestinal virus) to account for his array of symptoms. preventing dehydration is essential. i suspect he is nauseated so there are medicines that can be prescribed so that he can drink fluids without vomiting. call his medical provider. some immediate signs of dehydration includes lack of tears dry mouth and a reduced urine flow. if he is experiencing these he should be re-evaluated immediately by his medical provider.
alcohol can raise the blood pressure and slow down clotting. so it is a good idea to curtail drinking a few days before an extraction.
yes it is ok to take adderall with lexapro or prozac. both adderall and ssris like prozac and lexapro increase your levels of serotonin a chemical in your brain that affects your mood. taking them together can increase these levels too much and your doctor should be monitoring you for severe changes in your mood heart rate and blood pressure. if monitored properly you should be fine.

"according to the american cancer society's website: ""no sugar intake has not been shown to directly increase the risk of getting cancer or having it get worse (progress). still sugars and sugar-sweetened drinks add large amounts of calories to the diet and can cause weight gain which we know can affect cancer outcomes. "" it makes sense to eat a healthy whole food based diet with cancer which would naturally be low in added sugars but no one can say for sure if it feeds cancer. for more on diet see this webmd article. the american caner association is either being extremely negligent evasive or just plain ignorant when it comes to cancer. according to german doctor otto wartberg the ""crux of his nobel thesis was that malignant tumors frequently exhibit an increase in anaerobic glycolysis  a process whereby glucose is used as a fuel by cancer cells with lactic acid as an anaerobic byproduct  compared to normal tissues. 1 the large amount of lactic acid produced by this fermentation of glucose from cancer cells is then transported to the liver. this conversion of glucose to lactate generates a lower more acidic ph in cancerous tissues as well as overall physical fatigue from lactic acid buildup. 2 3 thus larger tumors tend to exhibit a more acidic ph. 4 this inefficient pathway for energy metabolism yields only 2 moles of adenosine triphosphate (atp) energy per mole of glucose compared to 38 moles of atp in the complete aerobic oxidation of glucose. by extracting only about 5 percent (2 vs. 38 moles of atp) of the available energy in the food supply and the body's calorie stores the cancer is ""wasting"" energy and the patient becomes tired and undernourished. this vicious cycle increases body wasting. 5 it is one reason why 40 percent of cancer patients die from malnutrition or cachexia. 6 hence cancer therapies should encompass regulating blood-glucose levels via diet supplements non-oral solutions for cachectic patients who lose their appetite medication exercise gradual weight loss and stress reduction. professional guidance and patient self-discipline are crucial at this point in the cancer process. the quest is not to eliminate sugars or carbohydrates from the diet but rather to control blood glucose within a narrow range to help starve the cancer and bolster immune function.

i've gone back and forth with the depo injections and oral contraceptives for the last decade or so i can't decide which is the lesser of the evils. there are certainly pros and cons to each but in the end i decided to stick with the oral contraceptives. why? although convenient (you only go in every quarter or so for a shot) but like you i've gained quite a bit of weight after the initial shot and my weight continue to skyrocket with each injection. after about three years i have gained a total of about 1/3 of my pre-depo body weight! not only was my body image suffering since the injections but my moods swings were swinging at full force i was tired all the time and my calcium levels were fast depleting! i loved the convenience of not having to take the pill on a daily basis but side effects of the injections turned me into someone who i ultimately hate! now that i'm back on the pill most of the side effects i've suffered from the depo has left my system and i'm somewhat back to my pre-depo body weight but i'm feeling so much more energized and alive! i didn't know the extent of the side effects until i decided on another form of birth control. true the pill may be a pain in the rear for someone as forgetful as i am but i'd rather forget and have to use a backup method than to suffer the ill effects the depo injections. birth control is a definite must for some women (myself included) and i've accepted the fact that there are side effects to any substance we take but it shouldn't interfere with our daily lives and turn us into someone/something we're not! with this experience i've learned that depo injections just didn't work for me but it may for others. in the end i think you should have an in-depth discussion with your gyn weigh your options and figure which will work best for you based on your needs your lifestyle and your preference.

the key is not to avoid certain foods when you have diabetes but to be aware of the total carbohydrate in foods and keep intake consistent throughout the day. a small piece of fresh fruit 1/2 cup canned and 1/4 cup dried fruit contains about one carb serving (15g total carbohydrates). most people with diabetes can have between 3 and 5 carbohydrate servings at each meal and 1 to 2 at snack time. foods with added sugars are less nutritious than foods with natural sources of sugar but what counts for blood glucose control is watching total carbs. for good health healthier sources of carbohydrates are recommended including whole grains fruits and low fat dairy. make sure to work with your healthcare provider on the appropriate of carbohydrates for you. for more on carb counting see this article.

what about hydrohydrosis?
i would like to know the details of your hystectomy. what exactly was removed. is there any bleeding? is the pain aggravated by eating? a stool and urine analysis are necessary.

make sure that you are; sleeping enough eating properly moderate exercise get check-up from dr. you may also need vitamins
whenever a person hits an extremity hard enough to break the skin we become concerned about a possible fracture. your friend probably would be well-advised to head for an urgent care facility for an x-ray especially given the level of bruising you describe. meanwhile your roommate can elevate her foot apply a compression bandage (like an ace wrap) for moderate compression (don't wrap it too tightly! ) and apply ice packs to the foot. these steps  the so-called rice approach for rest ice compress elevate  may help reduce swelling which hinders the body's healing response. i hope your roommate feels better soon!
it is not duotrav who is causing your symptoms in my opinion you could be suffering a hormonal disorder specially thyroid disorder get a thyroid profile done. note also that one of the rare symptoms of duotrav is it may mask symptoms of hypoglycemia in a rare population. although most of its side effects are localized to the eyes. also another test for blood sugar is necessary. feel better soon.
your symptoms are multiple system involvement. so i think you are having a kidney problem could be your cyst. and a problem in your neck causing numb and painful upper limbs. neck x ray and kidney new usg are important. thanks
hi i am an orthopaedic surgeon and at our clinic we have successfully treated patients with such type of fractures and ligament injuries by plaster cast immobilisation and strict non weight bearing. this should be done for atleast 4-6 weeks. taking calcium and vitamin d tablets will speed up the recovery process. a check xray has to be done before removing the cast to confirm union. the fractured fragments are not displaced and i do not see any reason for a surgery. surgery will cause more harm than benefits. thanks

"this could be a type of exertional migraine called ""orgasmic headache"". its pretty rare but something that we see occasionally in the headache clinic. there are medical article suggesting that some patients many have a problem like aneurysms as a cause for this but its not really clear if this is really a problem. i've seen a number of patients with this type of headache but i've never found any specific cause. some of the migraine type medications can work for this type of headache if it happens a lot. if it happens again you might want to talk with your doctor about an mri scan of the brain with an ""mra"" (mri arteriogram)."
"i'm sorry to hear you've suffered a spinal injury. that's always scary! ""c-spine"" refers to the cervical spine which consists of the first 7 vertebrae (bones) at the top of the spine (the part of the spine that connects to the base of your skull). this part of the spinal column protects some very important major nerves including the ones that enable a person to breathe. the question of whether or not you need surgery to correct your c-spine injury is entirely up to your doctor and depends on how severe the injury is. minor injuries to the cervical spine may heal on their own with help from stabilization (such as a soft or hard collar). more severe injuries may require surgery to ensure those major nerves i referred to don't get injured as well. cervical spinal fusion for degenerative disc disease or injury is not uncommon. i hope you find this information useful and that you're able to get through this without surgery!"
if i am a decision maker in your case. i would consider surgical options first to remove the abnormal cells causing barretts esophagus. then taking ppis in a low dose  like once every 2days and ranitidine 300mg every night as the long term use of ppis is accompanied with high risk of developing kidney disease. make the necessary life style changes avoid caffeinated beverages. spice and fatty foods. chocolate and peppermint. do not lye down at least 4hours after eating. speedy recovery wishes.

remember: before you start any exercise program consult with your health care provider. your health care provider can give you personal exercise guidelines based on your medical history. kegel exercises help strengthen the muscles that support the bladder uterus and bowels. by strengthening these muscles during your pregnancy you can develop the ability to relax and control the muscles in preparation for labor and birth. kegel exercises are also highly recommended during the postpartum period to promote the healing of perineal tissues increase the strength of the pelvic floor muscles and help these muscles return to a healthy state and also increase urinary control. to do kegels imagine you are trying to stop the flow of urine or trying not to pass gas. when you do this you are contracting the muscles of the pelvic floor and are practicing kegel exercises. while doing kegel exercises try not to move your leg buttock or abdominal muscles. in fact no one should be able to tell that you are doing kegel exercises. so you can do them anywhere! we recommend doing five sets of kegel exercises a day. each time you contract the muscles of the pelvic floor hold for a slow count of five and then relax. repeat this ten times for one set of kegels.

i've never heard of condoms causing a uti before. what i do know is that you should go pee right after you have sex. your pee kills the bacteria it's gotten with sex. whether you're a female the bacteria gets jammed back in during sex. as a male it's own bacteria stays and you need to pee to kill the bacteria. i once got a uti for lack of going to pee after sex. i regret it and make sure i go after sex now. it's something i never wish to feel again. if you keep getting them you should go to the doctor so you'll finally be rid of them. over the counter methods only work for so long.
it may be that you are pregnant. feeling nausea.

as many times as you can become mentally aware of your behind and as you do contract your glutes. you can be standing in line walking up stairs or running to the bus. pay attention to how they feel as you move. in addition to strength training and good nutrition you need to be doing regular cardio (goal is to burn 400 calories each session) with intensity intervals. that means when you hit the hills by increasing your treadmills incline youll cook a ton of calories compared to simply walking on the flat. or ramp up the speed with which you walk. intensity intervals simply mean adding hills and/or speed every now and again to your workout. other butt blasters: backward leg toe touch and lift: stand behind a chair toes facing forward with both hands placed on top of the chair for stability. keeping both knees straight extend your left leg back pointing your toes with your big toe touching the ground behind you. gently lift your left leg about 30 degrees off the ground without bending your knee. tighten your glutes and hold for a count of 10. bring down and touch the ground with your pointed big toe and lift right back up for another count of 10. repeat this 5 times and switch sides. donkey kick crossover: grab a mat and get on all fours with your hands under your shoulders. keep your left knee and ankle flexed as you lift your knee to hip level behind you. hold for a count of 5 and bring down touching the mat briefly and lift again. repeat 5 times and switch sides. butt bridge: lie face up on a mat with knees bent and feet flat arms by your side. left hips slowly off the floor forming a straight line from knees to shoulders. tighten your glutes and maintain this bridge position for a count of 10. bring your butt down for 10 seconds and lift back up again into bridge position for a count of 10. see if you can do it for a count of 20. repeat 5 times. sizzling squat: stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. engage your core abdominal muscles. place your hands behind your head elbows out to the side. squat down never going beyond a 90 degree angle to your lower legs. for novices or anyone with knee issues just squat down enough to feel your glutes engage well and hold for a count of 3. as you stand up for an added twist rotate your trunk to the left and lift your bent left knee in front of you. return to squat again. switch sides and repeat. do this whole set 5 times. invisible chair wall squat: you can do this anytime and anywhere theres a wall. standing straight place your back on a wall. squat down as previously described and imagine youre sitting on an invisible chair. squeeze your glutes. hold for a count of 5-10 (or 20 for the advanced) and stand up. rest for 10 seconds and repeat 5 times.

rosacea is a skin disorder that affects people above 30 years. other than acne like lesions people with rosacea have redness of face and dry skin associated with burning sensation. they also have redness and irritation in the eyes. the redness of the face is aggravated by triggering factors such as weather changes stress alcohol consumption exercise and spicy food. yours clinical condition is not rosacea since your history is contradicting with the above said information. you seem to have acne. the cysts are a part of acne. acne varies in severity from individual to individual. some may have mild acne which may come off and on. others may have almost incessant eruption of acne which may leave behind post acne hyperpigmentation and acne scars. for acne you need to be constantly taking care care of your skin until the tendency for new acne formation dies down. topical treatment of acne mainly revolves around topical antibacterials (clindamycin gel or nadifloxacin gel) benzoyl peroxide and topical retinoids. topical retinoids are comedolytic thereby preventing new acne. for inflammatory acne (papules and pustules) i advise to start with one of the oral antibiotics either azithromycin doxycycline or minocycline. cystic acne is an indication for starting oral retinoids. they are the most effective drugs for acne and are usually first choice in severe acne or cystic acne or moderately severe acne or acne not responding adequately to traditional anti-acne medications or acne significantly affecting the quality of life of patients regardless of severity. you could also take a few peeling sessions like salicylic acid peels from a dermatologist. salicylic acid peels are specific for acne. acne is a recurrent condition and once your acne is brought under good control with oral and topical anti-acne medicines you should still continue to use a cream/gel (topical retinoid) for maintenance of improvement. topical retinoids are ideal for maintenance of improvement because they are comedolytic as well as anti-inflammatory thereby preventing the formation of new acne. for further follow up consult a dermatologist online

for people with obstructive sleep apnea (osa) a cpap machine can be a life-changing device. ive written about the importance of regularly using your cpap machine before but there may be even more benefits to use of a cpap. most people with osa arent aware that they stop breathing multiple times during the night. this results in fragmented poor sleep as well as low blood oxygen levels. osa has been associated with an increased risk for myriad health problems including hypertension heart disease mood and memory problems â€” even difficulties driving. cpap stands for continuous positive airway pressure and cpap machines are the most effective and helpful treatment currently available for patients with osa. a new study in the journal sleep suggests that cpap therapy can do much more than improve sleep: patients who regularly use a cpap machine felt significantly less fatigue throughout the day. patients who regularly use a cpap machine also had much more energy. patients felt considerably less daytime sleepiness particularly patients who had previously been excessively sleepy or fatigued. scientists arent certain how and why cpap therapy can have these additional positive effects but they think that cpap may reduce inflammation which in turn reduces fatigue. whatever the reason this is great news for people who have osa â€” and even better news for people who are already using cpap machines to improve the quality of their sleep. ive said before that the cpap machine isnt exactly the most attractive or sexy addition to your bedroom. but in addition to completely transforming the way a person with osa sleeps it also has the potential to help people feel less fatigued and have more energy throughout the day. we already knew that cpap improves the quality of sleep of many many people â€” and spares their partners hours of listening to the snoring and loud breathing that can accompany osa. this study just gives us a few more reasons to recommend that patients with osa use their machines every night. the amazing machine that could. i use a bipap every night and it has made a significant difference in the way that i feel - at least in the morning. unfortunately in addition to sleep apnea i have severe hypersomnolence and i often fall asleep at my desk during the day while working. i can really feel the difference when i fall asleep without using my bipap and my throat is often dry and sore. yes! i have sleep apnea. when should my bipap or cpap machine be used?
there is no collagen product that when applied to the skin will penetrate and remain as intact collagen. the molecule is simply too large. however topical collagen can be a really good moisturizer. there are ingredients such as peptides and other antioxidants that can help stimulate collagen production. the effect won't be the same as having a soft tissue filler such as collagen or hyaluronic acid injected into the skin but they can help soften fine lines and wrinkles. the gold standard best product for brightening the skin is hydroquinone. other ingredients such as glutathione sepi-white n-acetyl glucosamine licorice root extract mulberry root extract and azeleic acid can also be helpful. there is no collagen pill that has been shown in proper studies to grow collagen. i do recommend a multivitamin daily omega-3 and vitamin d supplements always under the guidance of your physician.

"you must first identify the cause. not something that i can do for you over the internet. one possible culprit would be enzymatic detergents like tide or perfumed dryer-soften sheets (bounce etc. ) that cause a ""contact dermatitis"". of course there can be many other considerations. until you figure it out re-wash your sheets in a milder detergent and don't use a softener. take a long-acting antihistamine at bedtime."

an eight month old baby needs a proper balanced diet and should still be on formula or breast milk as part of their daily intake. of all the foods a baby should eat dark chocolate (or any chocolate for that matter) isn't one of them. there is plenty of time when the child is much older to introduce a little bit of chocolate for pleasure. not nutrition.

if you have a temperature of 100. 4Âºf or higher for more than 1 hour or a one-time temperature of 101Âºf or higher this should be considered an emergency. you should call your doctor right away even if it is in the middle of the night. its important for you to remember though that even if you dont have a fever but just arent feeling well you should call your doctor right away no matter the time of day. www. preventcancerinfections. org is an excellent resource to learn more about the risk of getting an infection during your chemotherapy.

"i had basically the same thing happen to me. i was driving in high holiday traffic during december on the bqe in nyc for my nieces' baptism. all of a sudden i was going numb on left side of my face and scalp as well as feeling weak but had no pain. then bam my eyesight went and came back. i panicked and managed to pull over. i had no idea what was happening to me. i thought i was having a stroke and my heart was racing because i panicked. so it felt like a heart attack. my boyfriend drove us the rest of the way and i went to the er to be checked out. i had an mri cat scan echo blood drawn for tests etc. i was vamped pricked and prodded by 4 different doctors. then the neurologist saw me and said he thinks i had an atypical complex migraine headache and a mild panic attack. i was told to avoid several things. all of which lead to migraine headaches and for me most are not avoidable but some are. thing such as chocolate too much sleep too little sleep caffeine stress alcohol smoking extreme fatigue skipping meals and bright or flickering lights. you better believe that the things this doctor listed pretty much was like a check list for my 6 hour drive. i worked a 10 hour shift skipped dinner drank 4 20 oz cups of coffee and had a chocolate bar all while arguing over navigation issues with the bf. also was stressing because i was the god mother and if we were late to the church my sister would never forgive me. i was also surprised to learn that when i would get stressed at work i would get a mild headache with a tick or fluttering eye muscle and ""floaters"" in my eye and that it was a migraine but with out the pain. i now keep a headache or migraine diary and try to figure out what my triggers are. the biggest ones for me are sleep stress and caffeine. just know that you aren't alone in this and you might never even have another one again. it helps to just take care of yourself and avoid caffeine/stress."
mitral valve prolapse (mvp) is often seen in fm. i conducted a study years ago at the ohio state university and published results that showed the majority of people with fm also had evidence of mvp on cardiac echo testing. mvp is a condition where one of the heart valves the mitral valve bulges excessively during the heartbeat. although it sounds scary most doctors feel that mvp is usually a benign condition. it may contribute to atypical chest wall pain in some patients with fm or it may be part of the dysfunctional autonomic nerves and contribute to rapid heart rate palpitations and shortness of breath in some. we're not sure exactly why those with fm seem to have more mvp than the general population. perhaps there is a genetic factor involved or a dynamic change that results from the dysfunctional autonomic nerves. more research is needed in this area. chest pain in fm is usually not angina but people with fm can have other problems too including heart problems. if there is ever any questions about chest pain or new cardiac symptoms a physician should be consulted at once.
atenolol is a blood pressure medication that has been used for some anxiety issues. if this seems to help him in these social situations then i do think it justifies using it. i don't believe he will experience any adverse effects from taking this low dose. there are other medications that may be more helpful if this does not work.

since you are only 20 and have no wrinkles then the best advice for you is to always wear sunblock stay out of the sun eat non-processed foods and drink 4-6 glasses of water a day. most wrinkles come from the sun. so your best anti-wrinkle cream if you don't have wrinkles is sunblock. at around 30 it does make sense to start with a nice anti-wrinkle cream. using expensive products is ok if you can afford it since they will provide good moisture and they feel good. moisturizing daily will keep the skin supple at any age. but only sun avoidance will really make a giant difference over time as far as line prevention is concerned.
it's difficult to say what is causing your weight change because i don't know your height or pre-pregnancy weight. women do burn about 500 more calories while breastfeeding so it could be the reason you weight is down. you say you are constantly eating but if that means grazing all day you might be getting less nutrition than you think. i recommend you eat 3 regular meals with 4-5 food groups and 2-3 snacks with 2-3 food groups (dairy fruits vegetables lean proteins whole grains and healthy fats). for example breakfast could be oatmeal with fruit nuts milk and a boiled egg. a snack could be an apple dipped in peanut butter with some yogurt. this article will help you meet your unique nutrition needs during this time. if you remain concerned with your weight see your healthcare provider.
if it does it is written on the bottle. that is a good question. i know that i have used bottles that i have kept around for years (mostly on my dogs when the get skunked). i think hydrogen peroxide is very stable and can last for a long time in a sealed bottle but if you are ever in doubt just buy a new one. it is also very inexpensive.

baby carrots are not at all bad for you! in fact theyre quite the contrary actually. there were concerns going around the internet that baby carrots were bad for you because they were rinsed in a solution that contains chlorine. its true that baby carrots as well as many other pre-cut vegetables on the market are cleansed using a solution that contains water and chlorine but this is to help prevent food borne bacteria like e. coli and salmonella. the baby carrots are rinsed again with potable water afterwards to reduce any trace of the chlorine. its important to know that the chlorine is used in amounts much lower than what the fda allows. also rinsing the baby carrots at home wouldnt make a difference because even your tap water has chlorine in it too! there were also rumors around the internet that a white film that you may see develop on the baby carrot is chlorine rising to the surface but its merely just a result of dehydration. the bottom line is that baby carrots are safe to eat are low in calories and are a great source of nutrients like vitamin a and fiber so they can be part of an overall healthy eating plan. no. these are fine to eat. they taste pretty-good too.

look for under-eye creams that contain ingredients such as niacinamide peptides and caffeine. be careful to also manage your salt intake get enough sleep and try not to rub the area around your eyes. if you have allergies/sinusitis be sure to keep them under control as much as possible since that can also contribute to the puffiness in this area. the under-eye area is also one place where stress shows very quickly so managing your stressors is helpful as well. avoid heavy eye creams that trap moisture into the skin and may cause puffiness. make sure you use a full face product with anti-aging ingredients that deliver firmness and protect skin from uv damage and ensure you add a targeted eye cream or serums for extra care. i've heard alot of people saying that by putting tea bag on the eyes can help. but i never try them yet.
plans vary from state to state and even from one health plan to another. you really need to take a number of factors into consideration beyond the premium such as how often you go to the doctor and how much you'll pay in co-pays and co-insurance for your visits. what doctors are in the network and are your prescriptions on the plan's formulary? these are all important factors for you to evaluate among the various plans being sold in your state. i suggest you work with someone to help walk you through the insurance options. you can find help in your area by searching on healthcare. gov. you can also look for an insurance agent certified to sell through healthcare. gov at nahu. org.
one of the first steps in quitting smoking is to examine the different methods to become smoke free and decide which one would work best for you. some of the options include nicotine replacement therapy (nrt) such as gum or patches; prescription medication like chantix or wellbutrin; or methods like tapering postponing or cold turkey. do research beforehand to weigh the pros and cons of each method before implementing a program. next think about how ready you are to quit smoking on a scale from 1 to 10 with 1 being not ready to quit whatsoever and 10 being ready to quit right now. pick a number that best represents where you stand at the moment. why didnt you pick a number that was lower? here it may help to think about the benefits that you stand to gain from quitting smoking or your reasons behind wanting to quit. what would it take for you to be higher on that scale towards a 10 then? at this point it might help to think about what you would need to become fully motivated and put your thoughts about quitting smoking into action. its important to develop strategies to help you be successful. what are potential barriers that may get in the way of your success and how do you plan to overcome them? it might be helpful to tell your friends your desire to quit and enlist their support in working towards your goal. no matter what dont give up! many people have several unsuccessful attempts before they finally are able to become smoke free because quitting smoking can be an incredibly difficult thing to do for some people. the webmd smoking cessation center would be a great resource for more information and for direction on where to get more help regarding becoming smoke free. talk to your doctor for further guidance as well.

"the short answer is: yes. unfortunately you have exposed yourself to genital herpes. it doesn't matter that the cold sore was scabbed over or that the lip lesion ""barely touched"" your penis. a person with herpes can spread the virus even when it's not active. your girlfriend's herpes most definitely was active since she had a lesion. this does not mean you positively will develop genital herpes but you're flirting with disaster. you need to take better precautions in the future. there is no cure for genital herpes. if you do develop genital herpes you absolutely must disclose the fact to your partners before you have sex with them. they have a right to decide whether or not to risk getting the virus from you. and while condom use is good be aware a condom won't necessarily protect you from herpes because the virus can reside in groin areas that aren't covered by the sheath. i'm not sure how old you are but you may want to read this article about the rise in genital herpes transmission among us teens due to having oral sex with an infected partner. even if you're not a teenager the same scenario applies to your story. please stop engaging in unsafe sex. always use a condom. don't have any type of sexual relations with a person who obviously has a virus that can become a sexually transmitted disease. you owe it to yourself and your sexual partners to be responsible about your sexual practices. wishing you well! there r two types of herpes. there r the oral kind and then there is genital kind. yes u can get herpes on your genitals from a cold sore. but even tho it is herpes on your genitals it is not actually the genital type of herpes. it is the oral type actually. u can spread each type to each area. yes her giving u head with a what looks like mainly healed sore can give u herpes. i have kissed a chick with a sore before to and didn't get nothing. some times your just lucky or perhaps your immune system is working harder and better at times i don't know. but u can get on acyclovir twice a day from your doctor it's herpes meds. or if u don't have insurance there is a natural pill for it u can get at health stores or what have u called l-lysine and take it twice a day and have her take it as well. hell even once a day would b good."

i dont think the idea that cold water causes fat in your stomach to congeal making weight loss more difficult holds much merit. all fat whether solid or liquid will get broken down metabolized and digested in your body. if anything ice cold water may actually slightly boost your metabolism to help promote weight loss. although its a very small amount your body has to expend calories to bring the ice water up to your bodys natural temperature. in your situation drinking water is helping to keep you from drinking soda which doesnt have much nutritional value and has excessive amounts of sugar. so you should continue to substitute water in place of sugar-laden beverages like soda in order to promote weight loss. you dont have to completely get rid of soda if you enjoy it but continue to be mindful of moderation and portion control when you do have it.
hi these are signs of reduced immunity. eat healthy diet. take protein supplements. no other active management required at present. thanks
the short answer is it depends. starting next year young adults who are younger than age 26 can stay on their parents' health insurance plans even if they have the option of enrolling in coverage offered by an employer. if you are in this situation you (and your family) should look carefully at the overall cost of adding you to your parents' plan compared to the cost you would have to pay for premiums under an employment-based option. in addition don't look only at premiums. consider factors as well such as: (1) whether your doctor or the hospital you may go to if you are sick are part of the two plan's networks; (2) how much coinsurance or copayments are for routine doctor's visits; and (3) what you will have to pay for prescription drugs under the various plans. and as always you should also listen to your parents! they may have views on this too.
there could be a few things going on. even though you eat healthy you could be low in nutrients causing you to feel tired. the only way to know for sure is to go for a physical and get labs run including vitamin d glucose and iron. also less likely increased hunger accompanied with thirst and weight loss could be sign of diabetes. also look closely at the quality of your diet. are you eating filling foods with meals including healthy fats (nuts and seeds/avocado/veg oils) whole grains lean proteins dairy beans/legumes and fruits and veggies? the fiber found in plant foods such as fruits vegetables whole grains and beans help fill you up. fat provides adequate calories and is satisfying and protein is also filling. make sure your meals contain 4-5 food groups and snacks 2-3. you want to avoid grazing on less filling snacks high in refined grains and low in nutrients (crackers pretzels chips). if you need help see a registered dietitian. you can find one in your area at eatright. org. read more. filling foods do you feel hungry and tired on days when you eat more than 3500 calories? probably there is mismatch between calorie intake and expenditure. feeling hungry is ok with your workout schedule but feeling tired is worrisome. any family history of diabetes please check. there are a few reasons you are feeling tired without any reason. one of them is anemia which is a lack of red blood cells and conversely oxygen from the lungs is not properly brought to the tissues and cells. anemia may be caused by deficiency of vitamins or minerals internal bleeding or chronic diseases. women who are at that time of the month are susceptible to anemia as blood is lost during menstruation. still iron deficiency due to menstruation is less than in pregnant women or lactating mothers as their body needs extra iron to maintain healthy blood levels. things may also go wrong when your thyroid glands refuse to cooperate with you. thyroid hormones thyroxine (t4) and triiodothyronine (t3) are responsible for metabolic processes in the body. too much thyroid hormone causes hyperthyroidism which speeds up metabolism while too little thyroid hormone slows down metabolism. hyperthyroidism causes fatigue and muscle weakness and starts in the thighs. doing energy demanding activities become difficult and other symptoms include weight loss feeling warm shorter menstruations increased heart rate and thirst. hypothyroidism also causes fatigue and muscle weakness. the symptoms are reversed to hyperthyroidism such as weight gain feeling cold and longer menstruations. diabetes notorious for causing a range of problems in the body is also related to fatigue. as glucose is the staple fuel of the body it is not utilized properly in patients with type 2 diabetes as the absence of insulin causes the glucose to build up in the body. without its staple fuel the tissues of the body are not nourished properly and causes fatigue. sadly being sad can also be the reason you feel tired. depression induces negative feelings and also has negative effects on the body as it causes a reduction in energy levels changes in sleep and eating patterns decreased concentration and overall laziness and worthlessness which keeps you in bed all day. reference: 
"hormones are substances produced by your endocrine glands that have a tremendous effect on bodily processes. they affect growth and development, mood, sexual function, reproduction, and metabolism."
"hello gigi !coughing up blood with sputum (henoptysis) is a red flag sign .. meaning to say it definitely needs medical attention . considering you have had tb in the past there are many possibilities for your present episodes of hemoptysis. it could me a bacterial infection or relapse of tb or post tb bronchiectasis (abnormal permanent dilation of your airways at few places which happens when they get damaged due to your past tb). take a course of antibiotic as prescribed by your physician ,consult with your physician and discuss about taking drugs like tranexemic acid which reduce the bleeding tendency , cough suppressants . while sleeping, lie on the side which was previously affected by tb and be on complete bed rest . once your hemoptysis gets controlled go for sputum examination to check for tb bacilli , chest x ray and if needed hrct thorax (to pick up bronchiectasis which can sometimes be not evident on x ray). since u mentioned severe back pain , vascular abnormalities concerning the descending aorta (the major blood vessel carrying blood from the heart)needs to be also considered treatment is to be decided based on the cause for your hemoptysis.do review with your physician and get the necessary investigations done."
she is allergic to something most likely. you and her allergist haven'tfound it quite yet and may never find it. some hives are caused by changes in temperature (like getting too warm). it is not necessary to know the cause of the hives in order to treat it successfully with antihistamines. i know hives can be frustrating but it can be very very difficult. even impossible to find the one (or many) causes.
it could be ovarian cysts like the ones i have but you should consult with a gynecologist to rule out or confirm this possibility.
i have peripheral artery disease. i got it in my late 40s due to blood coagulation problem. i also had very high cholesterol (over 300+ my entire life). i had difficulty walking by age 50. i put myself on high dose nattokinase and serrapeptase and the symptoms disappeared within 6 weeks. you will know it is working within 1 month. i eat as much cholesterol as i want. i have been on this over 6 years. i am on maintenance dose. just experiment with dosage over time to get the minimum dose and cost. please be aware that conventional medicine perpetuates lies about cholesterol. just take the time to look at the studies. if the arteries are clean enough you won't have heart disease. ignore the cholesterol propaganda. they have nattokinase made from bacteria and fungus with and without vitamin k. both work but i prefer the nattokinase with vitamin k. without vitamin k is for people on prescriptions drugs. i take best nattokinase and serrapeptase. i buy from swanson vitamin because they are cheap. ii'm amazed they don't have heart disease category for this. chinese have done thousands of studies on effectiveness of fibrolytic enzymes for heart attack and stroke prevention.
the problem is when men are young theyre going to live forever nothings going to get in their way thats why young guys do stupid things. because its not going to hurt them. why are teenagers promiscuous in the face of hiv hepatitis c and all those other diseases because it will happen to somebody else but it wont happen to them and then as men get older they get into this pattern of reactive care. they dont understand about proactive health care they dont understand that thats their body for life that they have to be in tune with their body and take care of it and if they do the quality of their life experience will be dramatically improved. but when they do these abusive things when they drink too much drugs overweight then that impacts on them. they dont realize that that never happening to me  it will happen and then its just around the corner. and then its often too late. why is it too late? because theyve had years of abusive behaviors. theyve eaten the wrong foods theyve had too much to drink they smoke hypertension diabetes liver disorders cholesterol problems. and those are the guys you know you read about people in their 40s and 50s who suddenly get a heart attack and die or have a massive stroke. it doesnt make sense. sometimes its random bad luck but sometimes its things theyve been doing all these years. unlike women who mentally society programs them to be into preventative health. they go to the ob-gyn young in life. they go to the doctor for checkups. women are the leaders in health care in this country almost all of the health care decisions are driven by women. im sure on webmd a lot of the women in fact on the mens health message board a lot of times its women asking the questions. you want to wonder if its about blood in the semen or erection disorders or pain or lumps or bumps how come the guy isnt there asking the question himself? and its because thats not what guys do. guys will comment on it but i dont know whether its fear or denial or maybe they dont value themselves enough but the wives are the ones that go online and ask the questions. even on your message board. even on the mens health message board. women are the ones asking the questions.
yes. you have to take off the shirt because even non-radio-opaque objects (like buttons) can hide a tiny mass or mimic a mass. as far as a journal resource you will need to find that yourself. you are doing this project not me.
hi you can get chlamydia by having vaginal anal or oral sex with someone who has chlamydia. but if you now did not have chlamydia then you would not be here asking this question yes? but as you now have it still the same answer gay or straight and yes it can stay hidden deep inside your body tissues your lucky sometimes can stay there for up to 15 years some couples get there marriages wrecked because of that. do hope this helps you. good luck
so pharmacists want to have a patient that comes to me that tells me about this particular medication and saying that its not working i have to ask him a few questions. i want to find out if they are applying the patch in the right way. sometimes patients don't understand that they have to apply a patch to a certain area of the body. they also may not understand that one of the things that they need to do is take off the patch that they shouldn't leave the other patch on and then put on another one. so i tend to ask a lot of questions about how you are using this patch. i will also ask them if they are keeping a diary about how their pain has been since they started it. now my skin is going to be different than your skin. so patches the drug is actually absorbed through the skin and gives the effect. so if your skin might be a little more thicker than mine it might take longer for that drug to pass. in this case i also want to ask the patient if he has made the physician fully aware of how he is using the patch and maybe we need to switch him to a different company. because they all make different platforms of how the drug is absorbed into the skin so he might need a different type of patch. also maybe we need to increase the strength of the patch and see how he does on that. so it's a step wise approach and individualized therapy. the physician probably wants to try this because at some point because of the past medication he was on he may have developed a tolerance to that medication and it wasn't really treating his pain. so the doctor is probably looking at other options instead to make it a little more easier for the patient.
com high heart rate should be neglected anyway you may be overstressed and anxious. other than calming down ang trying yoga. you should do a cbc and ecg to check for anaemia and any other pathology

chemotherapy knocks out the saliva glands. saliva lubricates the teeth and protects against acid decay and gum disease. when the saliva is diminished bacteria can run wild and cause the symptoms you described. see a dentist asap because there are solutions. salivary stimulants extra artificial saliva and fluoride supplements can all be excellent aides in combating your problems.
in my opinion you are falling under a big stress and this can cause what you are suffering from. i recommend starting asap doing regular yoga classes relaxation training meditation walking daily in open air also weight lifting can help raising your testosterone level but avoid taking any anabolics. do not try going medically treated with drugs unless you try life style changes and diet. regards

sometimes hitting the outer skin is half the battle. i used to have really bad acne when i was younger and they prescribed me a lot of creams that never worked. i heavily researched online and noticed how a diet plays a significant role in oily skin that results in breakouts. i decided to do a research study of my own and it involved a two week diet of using olive oil grease and other fatty foods. then the next two weeks i ate more vegetables (especially a & c) and also took 50 mg of zinc and cut the saturated fats within 40g and consumed 0 trans fats. the first two weeks i experienced break outs that only seemed to keep getting worse and worse. then the after the first week of eating healthier i noticed a halt and no new acne had sprung up or anything and most of my breakouts began to go away. at the end of the second week my skin had just about cleared up which was expected due to the vitamin a c and zinc helping reduce oily skin. in reality dermatology is a scam when many home remedies can be found in your home. hope this helps
"maybe if specifically prescribed by your medical provider for this purpose. i caution you against any self-treatment with steroids if this was your intent. i was given a direct injection in my bursae of cortisone which is quite different that taking it orally. if you look up definition of bursitis symptoms and treatment this is one of the recommended treatments. i recently had a fractured femur and am post operative three months and overdid my activity and got this pain i never have had before but with researching bursitis it was like a checklist item. thank goodness i had a follow up post surgical appointment and told my orthopedic doctor he did x-rays of my hip femoral head and the bump swelling i got on the side of my leg definitely follows the symptoms of bursitis. the doctor did not say ""you have bursitis"" but gave me a cortisone injection quickly after seeing the ""bursae bump"" as i call it. that is the only thing i fault him for but am glad i came here and coming from the medical field knew it had to be a bursae as it did not feel like muscle or nerve although i did have sharp sudden pain when it first started. i had been gardening as i was feeling better but think i over did it so i am ""resting"" the area but doing the band exercise gently as recommended by my doctor to strengthen my muscles around my surgical site. so i get to add this incident to now knowing what bursitis feels like. hope this helps someone else get help and evaluated by their doctor."
yes that is tinea fungal infection. iÌ‡ recommend using antifungal topical cream and using clorohexidine wash on the area to prevent recurrence
you need to have your ear medically-examined. it would not be possible to blindly guess where the blood is coming from based on your brief sentence. it could be from your ear canal. or a ruptured eardrum. before a treatment course is determined you must first have a diagnosis.
you wouldn't have a problem on a drug screening from taking the drugs you mentioned in the amounts you mentioned because they aren't related to narcotics. you could get a dui however or a driving under the influence charge if you drove erratically after taking too much cold medication and were caught by a cop. it would still be counted as being under the influence. but you'd have to be driving really badly and you'd have to fail the field sobriety test. moral? if you are woozy from cold meds stay home. it's safer anyway.
it will take 3-6 months for you to get pregnant. start taking folic acid tablet. hope it helps. consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online for further help  
well i need to know more so i can help you to get a proper diagnosis. how old are you? what are your dieting habits? your weight? any history of medical condition? what food or position makes it worse? i am waiting your reply
"they are called ""one a day"" because that is all you really should take. the body does not really store most vitamins so if you take two by accident (harmless) you will just pee out most of those excess vitamins so taking two would be a waste of money. certain vitamins like a or d can accumulate to toxic levels so one must be careful not to exceed the recommended dosage unless specifically prescribed by a medical provider. as a rule just take one a day. not two."
even though the doctor says the flu injection can't cause blood pressure to rise i had my second ever flu jab last week and within a few hours i started to feel nauseous and light headed. by the next morning i felt much worse. i had an oral hygienist appt and decided i'd probably be ok to attend. after that appt i was feeling so dizzy i went into doctors room in the same building to get checked as didn't think i could safely drive home. it turned out my bp was highish at 170/80 and had dropped to 144/90 an hour later. the doctor couldn't find any cause for the raised bp. i am 65 in very good health not on any medication have never had high bp before. i am sure it was the injection that caused it. i came right by the end of the second day. i will never have another flu injection.

the life cycle of the malaria parasite ( plasmodium ) is complicated and involves two hosts humans and anopheles mosquitoes. the disease is transmitted to humans when an infected anopheles mosquito bites a person and injects the malaria parasites (sporozoites) into the blood. sporozoites travel through the bloodstream to the liver mature and eventually infect the human red blood cells. while in red blood cells the parasites again develop until a mosquito takes a blood meal from an infected human and ingests human red blood cells containing the parasites. then the parasites reach the anopheles mosquito's stomach and eventually invade the mosquito salivary glands. when an anopheles mosquito bites a human these sporozoites complete and repeat the complex plasmodium life cycle. p. ovale and p. vivax can further complicate the cycle by producing dormant stages (hypnozoites) that may not develop for weeks to years.
well we have come a very very long way in technology for cleansing the skin and for taking care of our skin. so i have a feeling that if your grandmother used the products available today her skin would look even more young and more beautiful than it did in your eyes. we love our grandmas so they always look beautiful to us. but the newer cleansers are able to get the makeup off our skin without removing our natural oils and sometimes they can even add moisturizers into our skin before we even rinse off. so using the newer products will help your skin look younger and better and will help the products you put on afterwards penetrate more evenly which will be good for your skin as well.
most antihistamines are safe to use with medications for high blood pressure. but i would avoid the ones that also contain a decongestant as these may raise blood pressure. i would need to know which medications you take in order to provide a more precise answer. you should talk to your pharmacist before taking any over-the-counter medications especially if you have high blood pressure.
women whose ovaries produce inadequate estrogen are at an increased risk for osteoporosis. hyperprolactinemia can cause reduced estrogen production. although estrogen production may be restored after treatment for hyperprolactinemia even a year or two without estrogen can decrease the strength of the bones. women should protect themselves from osteoporosis by regular exercise and increased calcium intake through diet or supplementation and by avoiding smoking. women may want to have bone density measurements. they may also want to discuss estrogen replacement therapy with their doctors.
hi this is from nuvaring it may help you. some women miss periods on hormonal birth control even when they are not pregnant. consider the possibility that you may be pregnant if: you miss a period and nuvaring was out for more than 3 hours during the 3 weeks of ring use you miss a period and waited longer than 1 week to insert a new ring you have followed the instructions and you miss 2 periods in a row you have left nuvaring (etonogestrel/ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring) in place for longer than 4 weeks if you know or suspect you are pregnant do not use nuvaring. see your health care provider as soon as possible. hope this helps you. good luck
when you see a doctor about acne you'll have a physical exam and your doctor will ask about your medical history. women may be asked questions about their menstrual cycles. this information can help your doctor find out if hormones are playing a role in acne flare-ups. most often you won't have any special tests to diagnose acne. you may need other tests if your doctor suspects that acne is a symptom of another medical problem (such as higher-than-normal amounts of testosterone in a woman). webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

"residents are doctors getting advanced training in obstetrics. in order to learn by observing and participating they need to do those procedures. your hospital is most likely a ""teaching hospital"" that has many residents in many different specialty area. instead of seeing this as a training session view it as you had two doctors for the price of one. one highly experienced and another in training. two heads (and four hands) are always better than one head and two hands."

your doctor may suggest medications to reduce inflammation ease pain and control your shingles infection. painkillers such as aspirin or acetaminophen can relieve mild pain. anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (motrin) or naproxen (aleve) are also often helpful for pain. antiviral drugs such as acyclovir may help stop progression of the rash especially if used early in the course of the blister breakout. similar drugs such as valtrex or famvir can also be used. these drugs may also help stave off the painful after-effects of shingles known as postherpetic neuralgia. benzoin available over the counter may protect irritated skin when applied to unbroken lesions. antibiotics can keep the infection under control if the area becomes infected by bacteria. tricyclic antidepressants or seizure medication may be prescribed for the pain that lingers after lesions have healed. antidepressants may also help with depression that can occur with the onset of shingles or as a result of the lingering pain. steroids to reduce inflammation and postherpetic neuralgia are considered controversial.
it would depend on the type of ear infection: a middle ear infection or an external ear infection (swimmer's ear). yes it is possible. swimming with a middle ear infection especially if there was diving or underwater swimming could be painful. a deep dive could actually rupture an eardrum if you have a lot of middle ear pressure. swimming around on the surface of the water is not usually a problem. swimmer's ear (otitis externa) is often caused by water exposure so it is a good idea not to overly expose the ear canal to even more water until it has been treated. wearing a form-fitted ear plug may be helpful.

it would not be prudent or even possible to determine if someone was experiencing a stroke blindly over the internet. strokes are unilateral (one sided) and severe daily foot or leg cramping are not signs one would experience. these symptoms could indicate vascular problems or even neurological disorders however so they deserve a complete evaluation by your medical provider. expect some diagnostic tests; including blood tests and perhaps a low back x-ray or doppler imaging studies of your lower extremities if your medical provider feels these tests are necessary. never underestimate the wisdom of your bodies to give us warning signs so please do not ignore these symptoms.

"there really is no sure way of knowing without inspecting the blisters. however because of the reddening of the skin it leads me to believe you have an allergy. keep in mind an allergy can appear at any time. you could eat peanuts all your life then one day have a reaction. she could also have a yeast infection which has been passed on to you. it's rare for a male to get blisters from a transferred yeast infection but it can happen. yeast infections can be transferred during intercourse but it isn't a true sexually transmitted disease. women can get yeast infections from antibiotics or wearing panties that don't ""breathe"". and lastly the reason i want you to go to the dr. for inspection of the blisters. herpes. don't fly off the handle. i think this is the least likely. also keep in mind that herpes is not just transferred by intercourse. if she has a cold sore or ""fever blister"" on her mouth she could've transmitted it to you via oral sex. please don't automatically think your wife is cheating! get an accurate diagnosis from your doctor before you even give it a first thought!"

most helpful answer everything i have read says cold. if there is tissue damage the cold constricts blood flow which reduces spread of cellular components which can cause rupture of nearby cells making the injury worse and longer to heal. heat is not usually applied to an injury until 72 hours have passed. this is to increase circulation and promote healing. more recent research shows movement of skeletal muscles produces hormone-like substances that promote and speed healing of damaged or inflamed tissues throughout the body. so if you can move do. lastly a small meal of four parts carbs and one part protein within 90 minutes of exercise will help speed muscle recovery. the body will use that energy and protein to quickly try to re-construct those damaged tissues. this information is from exercise physiology. ice is typically among the first thing to do in the recovery process after strenuous exercise. icing your muscles helps to reduce pain and decrease swelling and inflammation. ice causes your blood vessels to narrow which will reduce your blood flow to the muscle or injured area. never place ice directly on your skin however. wrap an ice pack around a thin cloth and place on the affected muscle for ten minutes at a time. you can use ice multiple times per day for a few days after exercise but make sure to allow for your skin to return to room temperature before icing after each 10 minute interval. heat is typically applied to uscles or injuries that do not have swelling or inflammation. heat will cause your blood vessels to expand which improves circulation and allows more blood to go to the affected area. heat can be useful for chronic injuries and muscle soreness or it can be used before exercise to stimulate blood flow and help prepare the muscle for exercise. heat should also not be directly applied to skin and should be used for short 10-15 minute intervals. always check with your doctor before starting treatment of an injury especially if the condition worsens or fails to improve. within the first few days of an injury ice can help the process of healing. applying ice to injured tissue can cause blood vessels to shrink and this makes them less capable of releasing chemicals that lead to swelling inflammation and pain. after a few days it probably best to apply heat to sore muscles. this makes muscle spasms less likely and relaxes injured muscles. however because the events behind every injury are different speak with your doctor first. i have just spent the last 6 weeks in physical therapy. they always apply heat or have me get on a bike to heat up my muscles for 15 minutes before i go through any table massage work. next i do all my exercises then they end the session with 10 minutes of ice. somtimes what contributes to soreness is 1) lack of warm-up so insuffcicient oxygen was available to fuel the work. and 2) lack of cooldown which will help the muscles recover by completing any partial combustion of sugars for energy leaving residual metabolites such as one feels with the muscle burn of working beyond anerobic threshold. anerobic threshold can be increased through more careful training. i can exercise well beyond my predicted 100% of age heart rate for periods of 10 20 and 30 minutes or more
"eczema is a skin condition caused by inflammation. atopic dermatitis is the most common of the many types of eczema. while the word ""dermatitis"" means inflammation of the skin ""atopic"" refers to an allergic tendency which is often inherited. although atopic dermatitis itself is not caused by an allergy eczema sufferers have a higher risk of developing other allergic conditions (like asthma or hay fever). typically eczema causes skin to become itchy red and dry  even cracked and leathery. eczema most frequently appears on the face and extremities but it can show up in other areas too. eczema is a chronic problem for many people. it is most common among infants many of whom outgrow it before school age."
arthritis is inflammation in a joint. diagnosis is based on a history of joint pain stiffness and/or warmth redness or swelling and physical examination. the examination can demonstrate swelling and often limited range of motion of the joint. x-ray examination can support the diagnosis and often disclose the type of arthritis and it's severity. early diagnosis is important for early treatment. many types of arthritis can progress without treatment. this can lead to permanent destruction of cartilage bone and ligaments which can result in deformity and loss of function that is not reversible. moreover some forms of arthritis are associated with disease elsewhere in the body. to avoid injury to other body tissues early diagnosis can be crucial.

how old are you? you could be in the beginning of menopause. i stopped having my period long before the hot flashes even began to start like years! i was surprised when hot flashes actually started! i am 53 now but stopped having my period when i was about 40. i did not start hot flashes until about 45.
cervical cancer may have an underlying cause such as hpv (human papilloma virus) but i would have no idea if this man also has hpv. herpes is an entirely different type of infection that does not cause cervical cancer but can be transmitted to you during sex. a condom would offer a reasonable (but not 100%) protection against herpes. there are different strains of hpv. some of them cause cervical cancer and some of them cause genital warts. if his wife's cervical cancer was caused by hpv (most cases are) then he most certainly had or has a serious form of hpv. the herpes diagnosis is a completely separate issue. please keep in mind that hpv (and maybe herpes but i don't know about that) can be spread by contact with areas that are not covered by a condom. it can also be spread by oral or anal sex.

"we cannot change our genetics age or number of vaginal births! sadly there are not many scientific studies testing different forms of pelvic organ prolapse prevention. the strategies for prevention that are most often suggested include: kegel exercises up to four times daily. the hope is that by strengthening muscles in the pelvic floor that those muscles can help delay or reduce the onset of prolapse. physical exercise. regular exercise can help keep one's body weight down and being overweight is linked to prolapse. exercise is also reputed to keep muscles and ligaments more flexible. decrease straining to have a bowel movement. constipation or having to bear down increases pressure in the abdomen which ""pushes down"" on pelvic organs. eating a healthy diet with whole grains fruits and vegetable not only helps constipation but can improve body weight. treat chronic coughs. if one is a smoker  quit. if there is another reason for a chronic cough  have it treated. a cough increases the pressure inside the abdomen which can ""push down"" on pelvic organs. there are studies linking smoking with poorer tissue integrity after pelvic organ prolapse repair. use a correct technique for heavy lifting. straining to lift increases pressure within the abdomen. hysterectomy surgery considerations. if one is having a hysterectomy there are studies which suggest that attaching the uterine ligaments to the top of the vagina may help to keep the vagina from dropping down."

most helpful answer some people do experience vertigo and lightheadedness when taking bp meds. it happens a lot when going from laying to standing or sitting to standing. i recommend getting in these positions slowly and standing still for a few seconds before walking. these symptoms can also mean that your bp is dropping too low. if it continues and happens at other times besides just changing positions call your doctor. your meds may need to be lowered a bit or switched to something else.
normal since you were a light smoker. it takes approx. 2 weeks for it not to show up in blood work. i would say your safe for it not showing up.
it is recommended to avoid alcohol when taking lyrica. the problem is that alcohol may increase the sedative effects of alcohol. in other words make you sleepy. lyrica may also increase the effects that alcohol has on your body so that even a small amount of alcohol may feel like you had a lot more to drink. it is tough to predict the effects in any given person so that's why we recommend avoiding alcohol when taking this medication. i would not skip a dose without talking to your doctor.

sensodyne is a toothpaste for patients with sensitive teeth who would like to whiten their teeth. the jury is out on what is an appropriate age to whiten teeth. whitening toothpastes have polishing agents in addition to the mild abrasives that help remove surface stains from teeth. teeth that have surface stains are cleaned and whitened by whitening toothpastes. however deeper stains wont be affected. if your teeth have deeper darker stains due to injury or certain medications a more thorough brightening treatment such as bleaching or microabrasion will be required. if you choose to use whitening toothpaste make sure the toothpaste contains fluoride as well as whitening agents.

atopic dermatitis is very common worldwide and is becoming more common. it affects males and females equally and accounts for 10%-20% of all referrals to dermatologists (doctors who specialize in the care and treatment of skin diseases). atopic dermatitis occurs most often in infants and children and its onset decreases substantially with age. scientists estimate that 65% of patients develop symptoms in the first year of life and 90% develop symptoms before the age of 5. onset after age 30 is less common and often occurs after exposure of the skin to harsh conditions. people who live in urban areas and in climates with low humidity seem to be at an increased risk for developing atopic dermatitis. about 10% of all infants and young children experience symptoms of the disease. roughly 60% of these infants continue to have one or more symptoms of atopic dermatitis even after they reach adulthood.

"i obviously cannot see into your ear across cyberspace or conclusively interpret what your doctor called ""bubbles"" but he may have been referring to middle ear effusion (fluid). fluid in the middle ear can occur with colds and as the body tries to reabsorb this fluid and refill the middle ear space with air through your eustachian tubes there may be air bubbles that can be seen through the translucent eardrum. this condition is typically painless but a person may feel fullness or that their ears are clogged. the pain concerns me since pain can be a sign of infection or increased pressure. if your symptoms persist you will need to see your doctor again or a different medical professional for a second opinion."
"just a thought. probably have no energy because you are dehydrated from the increased loss of fluid even tho you are drinking it may very well not be enough. the blood may be caused from the increased amount of defecation causing irritation in the bowel. the first thing that comes to my mind is cholecystitis (gallbladder inflammation and/or stones). i have been an rn for over 20 years and have had this condition myself and it was necessary to have my gall bladder removed. the symptoms that you describe is exactly what i experienced to a ""t"". a total gall bladder work up was suggested on my behalf and surgery was required. a visit to your physician is must assuredly suggested and questions related to the gall bladder and even the pancreas should be explored."

the exact cause of gad is not fully known but a number of factors  including genetics brain chemistry and environmental stresses  appear to contribute to its development. genetics : some research suggests that family history plays a part in increasing the likelihood that a person will develop gad. this means that the tendency to develop gad may be passed on in families. brain chemistry : gad has been associated with abnormal levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain. neurotransmitters are special chemical messengers that help move information from nerve cell to nerve cell. if the neurotransmitters are out of balance messages cannot get through the brain properly. this can alter the way the brain reacts in certain situations leading to anxiety. environmental factors : trauma and stressful events such as abuse the death of a loved one divorce changing jobs or schools may lead to gad. gad also may become worse during periods of stress. the use of and withdrawal from addictive substances including alcohol caffeine and nicotine can also worsen anxiety.

unfortunately there isn't any way to pm anyone on this site. i totally understand wanting to be private if you are embarrassed about what happens though. you can post anonymously if you need to. a one on one chat with a real doctor is going to be a lot more helpful because brain disorders can't be diagnosed over the internet - there are just too many variables. good luck to you!
"the ematrix uses radiofrequency energy but also a technology that is fractional and ""sublative "" meaning that there is very little time needed for recovery and a broader range of skin types can have the treatment since it is gentler on the skin. i have been impressed with the improvement in acne scarring however several treatments are needed and you should be evaluated because some scars will improve more than others. it is important to understand that most scars will be improved but not completely resolved unless they are very superficial."
i've experience that feeling and its usually because i didn't eat enough during the day before my workout and i pushed myelf too hard. if you are overexherting yourself then it could be that you have low blood sugar and it is causing your dizziness and making you feel light headed. if you are not eating enough during the day before a strenusous workout this could be a side effect. i would try to eat a healthy meal that contains a good balance of protein/carbs/nutrients (try something like a chicken breast and a small sweet potato and maybe a small dinner roll). give your food some time to settle (an hour or two) then during your workout try to sip on a gatorade or vitamin water. try not to over do it when you work out sometimes people push themselves too hard and it can results in injury as well. if you are still experiencing those symptoms after trying this then i would see your doctor to make sure it's not something more serious.

"an erection is a sign of sexual arousal. it starts in your brain with something you see, feel, smell, or think. your nerves send chemical messages to the blood vessels in your penis. the arteries relax and open up to let more blood flow in. at the same time, the veins close up. once blood is in the penis, pressure traps it inside. your penis expands and holds the erection."

one of the most exciting areas of exercise research is the investigation of cognitive function. what scientists have learned so far is that brain neurons the special cells that help you think move perform all the bodily functions that keep you alive and even help your memory all increase in number after just a few days or weeks of regular activity. in a study where researchers used an mri machine to measure the amount of brain tissue in adults 55 years of age and older they found  consistent with other studies of aging and brain volume  that there were substantial declines in brain tissue density as a function of age in areas of the brain responsible for thinking and memory but importantly the losses in these areas were substantially reduced as a function of cardiovascular fitness. in other words the fittest individuals had the most brain tissue. how might fitness and more brain tissue help you? in another meta-analysis of older adults researchers found that the fittest individuals had the highest scores on tasks like coordination scheduling planning and memory. and in a recent study of 1 740 adults older than 65 researchers found that the incidence of dementia in individuals who walked three or more times per week was 35% lower than those individuals who walked less than three days per week.

"if you want to feel satisfied and kill carb cravings at the same time then head on over to lean protein. that means low fat dairy poultry fish and beans. you can also buy whey protein powder at any whole foods gnc or vitamin shoppe. i like to combine vanilla powder with skim milk and frozen berries for a protein shake  two scoops of protein equals 20 grams which is very satisfying. you're probably not eating enough protein. most people overeat carbs especially ones filled with refined sugars. refined sugars (white sugars) increase your insulin levels through the ceiling and then they come crashing down stimulating a major appetite for more sugar. it's a vicious cycle you want to avoid. stick with lots of non-starchy veggies and healthy fats like olive oil and nuts. just watch out for what i call ""bingeables""  foods that feel addictive to you and you can't seem to have just one. and if you have one you'll end up eating a mountain of them. finally try to eat a balance of healthy protein carb and fat roughly every 3-4 hours beginning with breakfast. that will help to quell your hunger and appetite as well."
ulcers the liquid from the stomach that refluxes into the esophagus damages the cells lining the esophagus. an ulcer is simply a break in the lining of the esophagus that occurs in an area of inflammation. ulcers and the additional inflammation they provoke may erode into the esophageal blood vessels and give rise to bleeding into the esophagus. occasionally the bleeding is severe and may require: blood transfusions. an endoscopic procedure (in which a tube is inserted through the mouth into the esophagus to visualize the site of bleeding and to stop the bleeding). surgical treatment. strictures ulcers of the esophagus heal with the formation of scars (fibrosis). over time the scar tissue shrinks and narrows the lumen (inner cavity) of the esophagus. this scarred narrowing is called a stricture. swallowed food may get stuck in the esophagus once the narrowing becomes severe enough. this situation may necessitate endoscopic removal of the stuck food. then to prevent food from sticking the narrowing must be stretched (widened). barrett's esophagus longstanding and/or severe gerd causes changes in the cells that line the esophagus in some patients. these cells are precancerous and finally become cancerous. this condition is referred to as barrett's esophagus and occurs in approximately 10% of patients with gerd. the type of esophageal cancer associated with barrett's esophagus (adenocarcinoma) is increasing in frequency. it is not clear why some patients with gerd develop barrett's esophagus but most do not. cough and asthma many nerves are in the lower esophagus. some of these nerves are stimulated by the refluxed acid and this stimulation results in pain (usually heartburn). other nerves that are stimulated do not produce pain. instead they stimulate yet other nerves that provoke coughing. in this way refluxed liquid can cause coughing without ever reaching the throat! in a similar manner reflux into the lower esophagus can stimulate esophageal nerves that connect to and can stimulate nerves going to the lungs. these nerves to the lungs then can cause the smaller breathing tubes to narrow resulting in an attack of asthma. inflammation of the throat and larynx if refluxed liquid gets past the upper esophageal sphincter it can enter the throat (pharynx) and even the voice box (larynx). the resulting inflammation can lead to a sore throat and hoarseness. as with coughing and asthma it is not clear just how commonly gerd is responsible for otherwise unexplained inflammation of the throat and larynx. inflammation and infection of the lungs refluxed liquid that passes the larynx can enter the lungs. the reflux of liquid into the lungs (called aspiration) often results in coughing and choking. aspiration however can also occur without producing these symptoms. with or without these symptoms aspiration may lead to infection of the lungs and result in pneumonia. this type of pneumonia is a serious problem requiring immediate treatment. when aspiration is unaccompanied by symptoms it can result in a slow progressive scarring of the lungs (pulmonary fibrosis) that can be seen on chest x-rays. fluid in the sinuses and middle ears the throat communicates with the nasal passages. in small children two patches of lymph tissue called the adenoids are located where the upper part of the throat joins the nasal passages. the passages from the sinuses and the tubes from the middle ears (eustachian tubes) open into the rear of the nasal passages near the adenoids. refluxed liquid that enters the upper throat can inflame the adenoids and cause them to swell. when the sinuses and middle ears are closed off from the nasal passages by the swelling of the adenoids fluid accumulates within them. this accumulation of fluid can lead to discomfort in the sinuses and ears.
poison ivy (or oak) is caused by exposure to the olioresin (oil) of the plant. it does not come back in the same place two months later unless you were re-exposed to the oil again. the oil can remain stable on an object for years so you don't have to come in contact with plant. just an object that still has the oil on it. please be sure you actually have poison ivy. many skin eruptions can mimic this allergic disorder and some can even show up in the same place (like eczema shingles etc. ).
it sounds like you may have had some kind of allergic reaction to an ingredient in the shampoo. normally when someone uses a product and develops symptoms that go away when they stop using the product it means an ingredient in the product was the cause of their symptoms. it may not have been the keratin at all. shampoos contain a wide variety of ingredients from perfumes to dyes. it's possible your scalp really didn't like one of the components of that particular shampoo's formula. all that said i admit i don't know anything about keratin treatments specifically. however i certainly would be hesitant to undergo any treatment with a reputation for making people's hair fall out! take care!
not likely. gonorrhea is painful a man with lots of penile discharge and pain on urination. i don't think he could have tolerated it for six days let alone six years. chlamydia is not as painful but again it is very unlikely that he has had untreated gonorrhea and chlamydia for six years. my guess is that he has sexually contracted it recently even if he denies it. he may not want to truthfully disclose this information.
1. taking the time to cook your familys meals is probably the most important step to cutting back on the salt. processed and prepared foods usually contain substantially more salt than youd ever add to your home prepared meals. 2. buy fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables. if you buy canned look for no salt added on the label. 3. choose alternate seasonings to flavor your food. if you use a seasoning blend select one that is salt-free. 4. be a label reader. salt will be listed as sodium.  select items that contain 5% of less of your daily salt intake. steer clear of food items that contain 20% or more of your daily salt intake! 5. look for hidden sources of salt: salad dressing canned soup/broth and packaged mixes. 6. love sushi? pick low-salt soy sauce (it usually has a green top). 7. avoid or limit high-salt meats - those that are smoked cured or processed. 8. dont put the salt shaker on the kitchen table.

most helpful answer low testosterone can cause a drop in sex drive poor erections and enlarged breast. its common in men and there are treatment options that include injections patches gels etc. one possible side effect of testosterone treatment is an enlargement of the prostate or bph with symptoms that can cause urinary frequency. in men this hormone is responsible for features such as facial pubic and body hair. it also helps maintain your sex drive and sperm production. the symptoms you describe seem more directly related to prostate or bladder problems rather than a low testosterone. speak with your doctor to get examined and treated if needed.
"you will need to see your health care provider or gynecologist for a proper examination to determine the true nature of this ""lump"". your description is just too vague for me to be able to narrow down the several possibilities but one common lump could be a bartholin gland cyst. you can do a little research to see if that fits the bill. the fact that this lump is bigger and more painful emphasizes the importance of medical intervention."
"everyone feels some discomfort about bringing up this topic. people (especially women) with incontinence problems tend not to bring them up during a routine examination. unfortunately some health care professionals don't automatically ask questions about urine leakage timing amount and frequency of incontinence episodes. one way for anyone to feel empowered about this difficult topic is to arrive for a medical appointment with some written descriptions about the problem. this can be as simple as a list of symptoms but what i find most useful is a three day bladder diary that details exactly what is going on with a patient. . in addition you can answer a standard set of questions in writing and share them during your appointment. this is an easy way to steer the conversation in the right direction. you can say something like ""i jotted down some items that i want to share with you so i wouldn't forget. "" here are some standard questions that will help you describe your problem: do i have strong sudden urges to urinate? do i urinate more than 8 times in a 24-hour period? do i have uncontrollable urges to urinate that sometimes result in wetting accidents? do i leak urine on the way to the bathroom? do i leak urine when i laugh or cough or when i participate in active sports? do i frequently get up two or more times during the night to go to the bathroom? do i avoid places because i do not know if there is a restroom near by? do i go to the bathroom so often that it interferes with my activities? do i frequently limit my fluid intake when i'm away from home so that i won't need to worry about finding a restroom? when i'm in an unfamiliar place do i make sure i know where the restroom is? do i use absorbent pads to keep from wetting my clothes? remember that you and your doctor or other health care provider (nurse practitioner physician assistant) are partners in solving your health problems. the better the information about them you share the more likely you will both be successful. there are many types of solutions for incontinence issues so go to your appointment expecting to control or completely resolve your urinary symptoms. and if the first treatment you try doesn't work keep trying. no one should live with incontinence controlling their life. hi diane here are answers to some standard questions that you asked: do i have strong sudden urges to urinate?

thank you for your question on ehealthforum. com dysmenorrhea (pain during periods) associated with back ache is common in some women especially young women in their initial years of sexual life. meningitis can produce headache due to interference with cerebrospinal fluid circulation by altering the intracranial pressures. if your meningitis was uncomplicated with no csf blockage it is unlikely to cause any problems. neurological examination will help in identifying any sequelae of meningitis suffered earlier. eye examination will show signs of increased intracranial pressure like optic disc edema. in an instance of raised intracranial pressure person suffers from headache (chronic) visual disturbance and even loss apart from other neurological symptoms depending on pressure related damage. if you do not have any of those mentioned than it is very unlikely that you have any symptoms related to meningitis sequelae. thank you.
"typically, your doctor will suggest a walking cast or boot  called a controlled ankle motion (cam) walker  only when other treatments haven't worked for you. the cast or cam walker forces you to rest your foot, which can help ease pain. but it's not a cure. when the cast comes off, the pain may come back. you'll probably need other treatments, too, like insoles and stretching."

no you can safely sleep with commercial earplugs. homemade ones perhaps not. earplugs made with a wad of cotton can become trapped in the ear but those inexpensive foam ones designed to block ambient noise are fine to use. have a good night's sleep. as long as the ear plugs are well fitted to your ears you should be fine. you obviously don't want them to be able to get inside the ear canal where they could be difficult to remove.
there are a lot of factors that go into the price of insurance - how much competition there is in the area how many hospitals and physicians are in a given area and how strong their bargaining power is how sick the people are that the insurance company enrolls etc. however many of the policies offered through the marketplaces/exchanges actually have lower premiums than many experts expected. you should try shopping on your state's marketplace to see what the premiums are. if you have low income you also may qualify for a subsidy.

i'm very sorry to hear this. alcoholism is a terrible disease. from the symptoms you describe it does sound like your father's physical condition is an advanced state of deterioration. yellowing of the white parts of the eye is a sign of liver failure. fatigue and weight loss often occur toward the end of life. i'm sorry your father won't seek medical attention. and i'm very sorry you have to witness his deterioration. obviously no one can predict how much time any individual has left on earth but in general this situation doesn't sound good. as a person enters the actual dying process they lose the ability to walk lose control of bladder and bowel function and eventually enter a coma-like state before they pass to the other side. are you able to get hospice care for your father? virtually all types of insurance cover this care which could be a great comfort to you and your dad. if your father is reluctant you can perhaps reassure him you only want him to be comfortable during this time of life. hospice care focuses on comfort and pain relief. at the very least perhaps you can get a hospice provider to make a home visit to evaluate the situation. i wish you peace.

first please confirm the pregnancy with a serum beta-hcg test (human chorionic gonadotropin) as urine pregnancy test is not reliable till eight days post missed periods. if the hcg levels are more than 5 ng/dl then she is pregnant. in that case as she has been a post c-section case medical abortion is not to be undertaken with either mifepristone or misoprostol simply. because the c-section scar would still be weak by one year and there are often chances of uterus rupture. the best option in that case would be an ultrasound guided dilation and curettage procedure for surgical abortion. please meet your gynecologist and get the needful. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online  
most helpful answer yes and yes. children can get hpv sometimes through birth and this can result in hpv in a child's throat or larynx for example (laryngeal papillomatosis). untreated this can lead to cancer. teenagers who are sexually involved or children who are sexually-molested can definitely get hpv and this can lead to cancer later in life. it would be highly highly unlikely to get hpv after sharing a bathtub or just using a used towel or other dirty laundry. while viruses can remain on some objects for hours. perhaps longer on wet objects. it really requires more of an intimate contact for an extended period of time to a susceptible person for transmission. some forms of hpv do not lead to cancer. only certain strains. the common wart is an hpv virus. the hpv vaccine for the more dangerous cancer-causing strains is very important and can be given as early as age ten.

"it all depends on what part of the hip replacement fails. there are times when a revision hip replacement just entails a change out of the liner in the hip socket portion of the replacement. this is generally a pretty easy operation to recover from. there are also times when the femoral component (thigh bone implant) and/or the acetabular component (metal part of the hip socket implant) fail. these are bigger operations and are associated with a longer period of recovery. there is not doubt that surgeons now have much better implants to use in these ""redo"" situations. it is hopeful that the options for these redo procedures continue to improve as we go forward. it is most important to make sure you keep an appropriate follow-up schedule with your surgeon so that early signs of failure are not missed."

"most of the signs and symptoms of hcv relate to the liver. less commonly hcv causes conditions outside of the liver. an example is when the body produces unusual antibodies called ""cryoglobulins. "" these cryoglobulins cause inflammation of the arteries (vasculitis) which may damage the skin joints and kidneys. patients with cryoglobulinemia may have joint pain arthritis a raised purple rash on the legs generalized pain or swelling. in addition these patients may develop raynaud's phenomenon in which the fingers and toes turn color (white then purple then red) and become painful at cold temperatures. two skin conditions lichen planus and porphyria cutanea tarda have been associated with chronic infection with hcv. for reasons that are unclear diabetes is three times more common among patients with chronic hcv infection than in the general population. low platelet counts may occur as a result of antibody-mediated platelet destruction. hcv also is associated with b-cell lymphoma a cancer of the lymph system."
thinning hair is a very common problem. it's as common in women as it is in men. but unfortunately for women it's much harder to conceal. and women don't really have the option of going bald and being proud of it the way men do sometimes. so it is important to be able to disguise that. let's start with the underlying causes. there are two types of hair loss that occur in women: scarring and non-scarring. the most common is non-scarring and this tends to be genetic and familial. even if no one in your family had hair loss it can still happen to you and still be part of your genetic makeup. so once you have that issue it's important to be evaluated by a dermatologist or internist or ob/gyn. there are a lot of doctors who can do the evaluations for you. sometimes we check hormonal levels. often even if the hormone tests come back normal there is still somewhat of an hormonal imbalance that may be occurring. people often think that thyroid changes can lead to hair loss but it really doesn't. it may make your hair more dry and brittle but doesn't typically make your hair fall out. but it's worth having your thyroid checked as well to make sure that everything is in order. taking supplements does not really help hair growth. i have a lot of patients who take biotin to help their hair grow. but it doesn't really help if you don't have a biotin deficiency. biotin will make your hair stronger potentially again only if you have a deficiency in that area. there are no other supplements that i know of that have been proven in the literature to help grow hair. however having any nutritional imbalance may have an effect on your hair. another cause of hair loss would be stress. sometimes when you have a stress you can see the hair loss starting about three months later. you have to think about what stress you might have had three to four months before because that's about how long it takes to show. to conceal hair loss you can try combing your hair different changing your hair style or coloring it a little closer to your own natural scalp or skin color. use more neutral tones as opposed to a very dark or light tones. also there are powders that you can add to your hair that work as hair expanders to make your hair appear more full and thick. the one thing you don't want to do is to over tease or over process your hair because then you are pulling it out and causing more damage.

i would suggest setting up an appointment with a dermatologist. when i was diagnosed with eczema by my general physician i was prescribed triamcinolone acetonide which didn't do much. it was later found out that i had psoriasis (your description sounds similar to my symptoms) and i was prescribed clobetasol propionate for two weeks followed by triamcinolone acetonide for 6 weeks or until the symptoms disappeared. i'm no doctor but i have a lot of experience with rashes as i have suffered from psoriasis for many years. i would also suggest visiting an allergist as they would find out what is causing the flare ups. eczema is typically allergy related if i'm not mistaken. lastly i would suggest cleaning all her laundry and bedsheets with sensitive skin detergent (arm & hammer is great). is she allergic to any foods? maybe you could keep track of what she eats and see if you can pinpoint the flare ups to any particular food? like i said do not take my advise to heart only my suggestions as i am not a physician. hope i helped and good luck.

"tumor cells compete for nutrients often at the expense of the normal cells' growth. in addition to fatigue weight loss and decreased appetite are common. decreased nutrition from the side effects of treatments (such as nausea vomiting mouth sores taste changes heartburn or diarrhea) can cause fatigue. cancer treatments specifically chemotherapy can cause reduced blood counts which may lead to anemia a blood disorder that occurs when the blood cannot adequately transport oxygen through the body. when tissues don't get enough oxygen fatigue can result. medicines used to treat side effects such as nausea pain depression anxiety and seizures can cause fatigue. research shows that chronic severe pain increases fatigue. stress can worsen feelings of fatigue. stress can result from dealing with the disease and the ""unknowns "" as well as from worrying about daily accomplishments or trying to meet the expectations of others. fatigue may occur when you try to maintain your normal daily routine and activities during treatments. modifying your schedule and activities can help conserve energy. depression and fatigue often go hand-in-hand. it may not be clear which started first. one way to sort this out is to try to understand your depressed feelings and how they affect your life. if you are depressed all the time were depressed before your cancer diagnosis are preoccupied with feeling worthless and useless you may need treatment for depression."
yes if you are having unprotected sex especially on days that you have calculated to be fertile times (ovulation) and your male partner is capable of fathering a child it is possible that you could be pregnant. only time. and a positive pregnancy test. will confirm this. if your period is not due for 14 days you are likely to be mid-cycle so it is too early to start getting pregnancy tests. wait a few more weeks. your white milky discharge is not a definitive sign of pregnancy

antacids yes you certainly can and the one thing i will tell you is it could cause constipation or it could cause diarrhea. so i really want to make sure that patients understand that. they also develop a condition called rebound which means when they get their heartburn it will come back. after taking too many antacids it will come back really more severe than they ever had before. so you want to be tracking what you eat you want to be tracking your episodes and you want to be limiting your intake. typically with an antacid you want to limit its use to about two weeks. if you feel that your symptoms are still there you are going to want to talk to your doctor or healthcare provider for further evaluation.
unfortunately it is not possible to accurately determine a skin diagnosis blindly over the internet. a desciption is just too vague so this is going to require a hand-on medical examination by your primary care clinician or a dermatologist.
"interestingly yes you can use breast milk for diaper rash. although i'm not aware of any studies that prove it works many women claim it does. it certainly can't hurt to try. my concern is when you say the rash is ""all over. "" i hope you mean ""all over"" the baby's bottom. if your baby is having a rash above the waist you should seek medical treatment. with diaper rash prevention is better than treatment. remember diaper rashes thrive in moist environments. it's very important that you thoroughly clean and dry your baby's genitals groin and bottom with each diaper change. and never leave your baby ""soaking"" in wet diapers. change the diapers regularly. instead of commercial baby wipes try cleaning with a soft cloth and plain water to make sure your baby isn't having an allergic skin reaction to something in the wipes. wishing you and your baby well!"

although the research on whether they work shows mixed results some octors said they do find relief from natural remedies. i use echinacea and goldenseal because they help boost the immune system and fight off microbes  says lauren richter do assistant professor of family and community medicine at the university of maryland center for integrative medicine. even so studies havent found much evidence that echinacea prevents upper respiratory infections but some of its extracts (such as e. pallida and e. purpurea) may help you feel better if you are already sick. what about zinc? some studies show it can shorten the duration and reduce the severity of colds while others have found the evidence isnt strong enough yet to recommend it. most doctors arent convinced that using herbal remedies is worth the effort. and one note of caution if you do take herbal remedies: check with your doctor first. just because theyre all-natural doesnt mean they dont have side effects; for example some studies have shown that zinc nasal sprays and swabs may reduce your sense of smell. more important herbal remedies may interfere with medicines youre already taking.
you cannot accurately diagnose a rotator cuff tear by symptoms alone and certainly not as a self-diagnosis. even your doctor may have difficulty unless an mri is ordered. take it from someone who had a rotator cuff tear. you need to see a good orthopedist and probably need to have imaging studies (like an mri). i think you should take rods advice hon. i too had rotator cuff repair bicep and then cuff again. when the dr. did the cuff repair the first time he said that the bicep was only torn about 8 % so he thought it would mend itself. 5 months later took an mri and the bicep was torn by 65% so i went in for bicep surgery. 5 months later another mri because i was still in pain. needed rotator cuff repair again and trigger finger release surgery. this last time my shoulder felt great a week after surgery but my finger was in pain and just didn't feel right. unfortunately i had a back pain and jerked my shoulder just a little bit which started pain in my arm/shoulder once again. went back to the dr. he gave me antiinflammatory cream to put on my finger and shoulder made an appt. for 6 wks. and sent me on my way. i had this last appt. got tired of waiting 1:15 min. later so i tried to get a new dr. - they all keep saying they can't help me. try going to the university hospital! so this is where i am at. i guess what i am trying to say is that you definitely need a dr. to look at it and if what your dr. prescribes isn't working or if he decides you need surgery - get a second opinion.

by age 65 more than half of us will have x-ray evidence of osteoarthritis a disease in which the cartilage that covers the ends of the bones at the joints breaks down and bony overgrowth occurs. for many the result is stiffness and pain in the joint. although osteoarthritis is more common as we age it is not an inevitable part of aging. as researchers work to understand the causes of osteoarthritis they are able to offer advice to help prevent the disease or its progression and lessen its impact on your life.
copd and heart failure cause the same main symptom: shortness of breath with exertion. people with copd heart failure or both have a limited ability to exercise climb stairs or walk long distances. difficulty breathing occurs for different reasons in copd and heart failure. people with copd have difficulty exhaling all the air in their lungs because of lung damage  often from years of smoking. when it takes longer to exhale completely its hard to increase the rate of breathing. most people with copd breathe comfortably while resting. during exertion though breaths start coming in before air from the last breath has been exhaled and shortness of breath results. in people with heart failure the heart does not pump blood efficiently. as in copd most people with heart failure can breathe easily when at rest. with activity blood flow must increase and the heart must pump harder and faster. if the heart cant keep up blood backs up into the lungs. this fluid congestion causes shortness of breath.
"cervical cancer grows slowly. but even if you have only precancerous changes in your cervical cells, you may decide to have a hysterectomy. that may be particularly so if abnormal cells are found inside the opening of your cervix or you have severe or recurring dysplasia. this surgery is more likely to be done if you do not plan to have children in the future."

not everyone is seeing lower costs. whether or not your premiums will increase depends entirely on your income and how many people in your family you need to cover. it's always a good idea to shop around to see if there is a good plan available to you at a lower cost than what you're currently paying.

the easiest way to estimate when you'll ovulate is to count back. first figure out what day your next period will probably start. (if your period is very irregular this method won't work for you. ) from that day count back 12 days and then another four. you're most likely to ovulate during this five-day range. if you're one of the many women who have a 28-day cycle there's a good chance youll ovulate on day 14. (day 1 is the first day of your period; day 28 is the last day before day 1 of your next period. )

"there is no lead in a ""lead"" pencil anymore just graphite so you won;t get any lead poisoning. assuming the area is not infected the only problem would be the possibility of a permanent black ""tattoo"" from the graphite. i actually have one on my knee from being stabbed by a pencil in 7th grade (i deserved it). if there is a black stain in the wound this should be removed to avoid a permanent black spot that may be cosmetically unattractive."
the most common form of gingivitis known as plaque-induced gingivitis develops due to plaque adhering to tooth surfaces. this is also the most common form of periodontal disease. in the absence of treatment gingivitis may progress to periodontitis which is a destructive form of periodontal disease. bleeding comes from inflammation. if you are bleeding every time you brush you need to see your dentist immediately.
does your son have tubes in his ears? if not then he has most likely experienced a spontaneous rupture of his eardrum due to a middle ear infection. another less-likely source would be trauma - he put something in his ear or sustained a scratch resulting in an infection in the ear canal itself. .
"well i'd sure like to hear the backstory on this one. you're referring to the als association ""ice bucket challenge "" i presume? the one where people pour a bucket of ice water over their heads and donate money to the als association? if that's what we're talking about then i would cautiously answer your question with a ""no "" while also stating i'm not a doctor and cannot give medical advice. i'm betting you're asking this question because someone poured a bucket of ice water over their head and then fainted. this would not be uncommon and i'm surprised we haven't heard of it happening before. why would dumping a bucket of ice water over your head possibly cause you to faint? it's called "" the vagal effect. "" dunking your face in icy water causes your heart rate to suddenly slow way down. this is often referred to as the ""diving reflex. "" if the heart rate slows suddenly you can pass out. usually this lasts for only a few moments. it is not an indication of an underlying heart problem. interestingly you can also faint by holding your breath and bearing down hard to push out a bowel movement  another way to suddenly slow your heart rate down. think about that before you try to rush your bowels in the bathroom next time. wishing you well!"

men have two testicles so it is good to have this spare if one of the testicles are injured to the point where sperm cannot be formed. i have no idea if your partner is capable of having children but my guess would be yes. he can have a semen analysis to check his sperm count or just wait until you are ready to have children and check it out then if you are unable to conceive. no sense in worrying about an issue. that may not even be an issue. even with one testicle function and a decreased count a man usually makes more than enough sperm to do the job.
simple answer yes. complex answer sometimes every pregnancy is different. as your pregnancy progresses things like morning sickness can fade or come and go. i have 4 children currently 20 weeks along with my 5th. my first 2 both boys i was sick from day of conception to day of delivery. my first daughter i had morning sickness till the third trimester. my second daughter i had mild nausea the first trimester that went away by end of first trimester. this preg i have had nausea that finally went away about 2 weeks ago. tiredness usually eases near end of first trimester but comes back during third trimester. if this your first take advantage of the rest while you can because once that baby is born you will not get much the first year or so between feedings and diaper changes. that urge to pee every 20 or 30 minutes will ease up to a point near end of first trimester too but warning this comes back hard in third trimester. if you have an active baby this can be worse and i strongly recommend keeping liners or incontenance pads or diapers on hand especially if you don't have the strongest bladder. trust me all it really takes is 1 strong kick to the bladder and you can/will loose your bladder or have leakage. keegle exercises help to strengthen muscles and can be done any time. keep in mind that the more children you have the higher the likelyhood of having this issue. hope this helps.
if your child's bmi percentile is in the healthy zone then congratulations! it sounds like your child is at maybe the ~90th percentile for height and a 50% weight so that might be around the 25th percentile for bmi. if the trend is good then your child's growth is tracking along a healthy path. children who have 2 parents with weight issues are at higher risk of obesity that is 13 times higher than the baseline so you are doing a great job. just like i would counsel parents with a child at the 75 or 80th percentiles not to worry likewise feel good about your child being at the 20-25th percentile.
most helpful answer this is a cyst near or on your left ovary. without seeing the results of your test and delve into your medical history i have no way of knowing the significance or treatment approaches. ovarian cysts are more likely to be non-cancerous and may even be self-resolving (like corpus lutiem cysts - the ones that form as a result of monthly ovulation). you will need to discuss patient-specific questions with your own doctor. someone who is familiar with your particular case

in polycystic ovaries the hormone dis-balance is such that there are long intervals in between two periods. relax deranged sugar levels are common in pcod but that does not mean that you would have diabetes in future. metformin is commonly prescribed in case of pcod. doing some lifestyle changes will help you like- 1. reduce saturated fat intake. 2. maintain good body composition. 3. increase dietary fiber. 4. increase aerobic exercise. 5. restrict sugar intake. you can also consider visiting a dietician who can help you in diet according to your requirements and choice. take care!
"you have been doing this for ten years. it is now a well-established habit. you don't need to do this of course. your vagina or your urinary bladder should not be leaking fluid or creating moisture to the point where you need ""protection"". this habit most likely stared when you first ""estrogenized"" - started having estrogen. this caused a mucous discharge that may have freaked out a little girl thinking she would have an embarrassing wet spot. use a light panty shield like you use for your period and i think you will find it dry most of the time. perhaps this will give you the confidence to stop this little girl habit that you can't seem to stop. if you are getting an unusual amount of moisture see your gynecologist for a careful exam to determine the reason."

it is very common for all men and women to experience small aches and pains due to muscoloskeletal issues or tissue wear and tear. the analysis of your history and symptoms do not indicate that you have serious neurological issues like als. this is true since all the tests including the mri have been found to be normal. the other possibilities would be that you have a low threshold to pain or they could be due to psychological issues. conditions like fibromyalgia or chronic pain syndromes might also be a possibility. it would be recommended that you consult a rheumatologist and a psychiatrist who can help with proper diagnosis and also proper counseling and behavior management to help you manage and live with the pain. i hope this helps.
since you have had this injury a long time ago with no effect on breathing over a 19 month period i do not think it is related. the initial injuries was mostly contusions and they have gone. but your shoulder stiffness must have been treated as you are so young to live with such problem. the current breathing difficulty is related to the recent chest infection as the vital capacity decreases with chest infections and you need rehabilitation with breathing exercise (diaphragmatic) and incentive spirometer device training.
"well let's start at the beginning. i'll include some links to more information. the bun (blood urea nitrogen) test basically is used to give an idea of how well your kidneys are working. a ""normal"" bun range for adults is around 6-20 mg/dl. the fact your bun is 21 isn't necessarily reason for concern. many factors (including various medications) can affect the bun result and 21 might even be normal for you. it's hard to say without some past lab results to compare with. serum creatinine ranges in adult men run from about 0. 6-1. 2 mg/dl and for women the range is around 0. 4-1. 0. so it sounds like your creatinine level is within normal limits. a normal bun:creatinine ratio is considered to be 10:1-20:1. your bun/creatinine ratio is slightly elevated but probably no cause for alarm. however your best bet is always to consult a health care provider to discuss these results. what's normal for one person may not be normal for another. that's why we health professionals recommend you get blood work done every year. by comparing past results with current ones we can get a better idea of whether you have a problem developing that needs treatment. since i have no background information on you specifically it's impossible to say if these results deserve further investigation. if you're at all concerned about them you should visit your primary care provider. best wishes to you! no"
the good old-fashioned exercise treadmill test remains one of the most powerful diagnostic tests we have to assess a persons cardiovascular risk. a stress test typically consists of a brisk walk on a treadmill according to a protocol of increasing speed and elevation. electrocardiographic monitoring documents abnormal heart rhythms and other indicators that your heart is under stress from lack of oxygen during exercise. these more sophisticated measurements coupled with simpler signs like heart rate blood pressure and exercise duration help your doctor better understand your level of fitness and your risk of having coronary artery disease. but the latest research suggests that we havent been doing it entirely the right way for about half of the population. you have probably heard that if you subtract your age from 220 you will get your predicted maximal heart rate. that is if youre a man. the research studies that gave us this equation were performed on men back in the 1970s. and like many studies performed on men (and like many things in the 1970s in general) the results dont always apply to women today. so a group of researchers at northwestern university decided to tackle this question by monitoring exercise tests in over 5 000 women and looked for correlations between heart rate and increasing risk for heart attacks. their data resulted in a new improved and gender-appropriate calculation of 206 minus 0. 88 of a womens age to predict maximal heart rate. the changes between the old and the new calculations might result in small differences in the peak heart rates doctors might expect you to achieve or the targets that might be used in exercise testing or even when youre at the gym. its interesting information but is it useful? for years stress tests have been used to estimate cardiovascular risk with excellent track records in both women and men despite using the same calculations. occasionally a stress test is considered suboptimal or less diagnostic if a person does not achieve a particular heart rate. now that the threshold is different this may result in more conclusive tests. but how should this impact your workout? while treadmills and elliptical machines present information about heart rate and zones for fat burning and cardiovascular training  the reality is that tailoring your workout to your heart rate is not as important as tailoring it to how you feel. you can have an excellent workout at a lower or higher heart rate depending on what you do and how long you are doing it. and tailoring your workout to your age (by using the heart rate calculation) just seems sort of depressing. the bottom line is that you should exercise consistently and to the best of your ability â€” regardless of your heart rate age or sex. competitive athletes and gadget hounds will find this new information helpful in gauging the intensity of a particular workout but for the rest of us the most important calculation is how to find time to get to the gym in the first place.

if there is no walled off cavity or abscess formation then drainage or any surgical intervention would not be required. antibiotics would be required for addressing the pansinusitis for 3 to 4 weeks. a better alternative would be levofloxacin at a high dose 500 mg bd or moxifloxacin in consultation with an ent specialist. wishing you best of health thanks

there is very little fiber in breast milk so it is not uncommon for a breast fed baby to defecate several times a day (even as you feed them) or as infrequently as once a week. it takes about three months for babies to grow a healthy bacterial flora in their intestines so gas pains are less common after three months but babies can still clear a room at times with some smelly ones. there is not much you can do about this expect blame it on your husband.
yes it would be appropriate for you to see a medical provider so that you can have your throat properly examined. a sore throat primarily in the mornings wiht improvement in the afternoon may be due to post-nasal drainage at night accompanied by mouth-breathing. allergies can cause this but so can back to back viral infections. mononucleosis is a virus that can cause a sore throat. people also worry about a lingering strep infection so this can be tested for during your examination if your medical provider feels it is necessary. as you have read there are many possibilities to consider so you are wise to seek medical care at this point. i'd say so. it may be something minor like dryness due to furnace season being upon us or post-nasal drip but since the symptoms are bugging you and aren't responding to over-the-counter (otc) remedies you won't lose anything by seeing the doctor. it could be you have a sinus infection or something else that's treatable. and then you won't be uncomfortable anymore. best wishes to you!

platelets are the tiny blood cells that help stop bleeding by binding together to form a clump or plug at sites of injury inside blood vessels. a normal platelet count is between 150 000 and 450 000 platelets per microliter (one-millionth of a liter abbreviated mcl). the average platelet count is 237 000 per mcl in men and 266 000 per mcl in women. a platelet count below 150 000 per mcl is called thrombocytopenia while a platelet count over 450 000 is called thrombocytosis. platelets seem to have a large backup capacity: blood typically still clots normally as long as the platelet count is above 50 000 per mcl (assuming no other problems are present). spontaneous bleeding doesnt usually occur unless the platelet count falls to 10 000 or 20 000 per mcl. platelets are constantly being produced in the bone marrow. a low or high platelet count is not often a problem by itself but can frequently be a sign of another medical condition. for this reason high or low platelet counts require additional medical attention. 329

bikram yoga is a form of yoga developed by bikram choudhury. in this practice the classroom is heated to 105 degrees fahrenheit and 40% humidity. from there students perform 26 postures and 2 breathing exercises over 90 minutes specifically selected by choudhury to improve health and stamina. the classes are highly structured and poses are performed in an exact sequence every time and repeated twice. many people praise this form of yoga and i have found it very beneficial. however not everyone is a proponent of this training. many health professionals contend that stretching in extreme heat increases your chances of injury. muscles and other connective tissues warmed by the high room temperature allow you to stretch well beyond normal limits. furthermore exercising in extreme heat significantly increases chances of dehydration and places a huge stress on the cardiovascular system that could be harmful to some people. if youre interested in this form of yoga its important to keep three things in mind. one this is a very physically demanding form of exercise and is not for everyone. two if you have any previous injuries or health conditions ask your doctor if this type of training is appropriate for you. three remember bikram yoga is not the only form of yoga available. numerous studies involving all types of yoga (ananda ashtanga and iyengar) can improve your health.
the short answer to your question is this: any prescription medication should only be taken as prescribed. that means it should be taken at the dosage prescribed and it should be taken at the times prescribed. any deviation from the dosing schedule could be harmful in different ways and different degrees. unfortunately i can't answer questions about specific doses of medication because i'm not a doctor or pharmacist. if you have concerns about your medications including divalproex you can consult your pharmacist or medical provider. he or she can advise you about specific dosages. all the best to you!

out of curiosity from what parts of her body did they try to draw blood besides the mid-arm? for example did they attempt to draw blood from veins in her hands? what about her feet? if these other areas were not tried they may be more fruitful. emla is definitely a great option since it provides total anesthesia (no pain) if applied more than an hour in advance. it can be applied in multiple locations well in advance of the next attempted blood draw. hopefully your daughter is not too traumatized by the failed attempts at blood drawing. speak with your child's doctor about using emla in the future.
growth in terms of height drastically reduces after puberty. you have not mentioned your gender. theoretically with proper nutrition and under ideal circumstances growth in height stops in women at 18 years and in men at 24 years. this does not consider other factors like family tendencies and genetic inheritance. i suggest you to have nutritionally rich food like milk and milk products egg yolk lean meat like fish fresh fruits and vegetables. you can also indulge in stretching exercises and yoga that will give you better posture and help you to look taller. if you are overweight focus on losing weight. sleep for at least 8 hours a day. you need to drink 6-8 glasses of water a day to detoxify your body. following these tips will help in maintaining ideal body condition. that coupled with yoga and other exercises should help you. consult a nutritionist online for further follow up -

headache which you have described could be migraines. i would need to know answer of few questions which would help me in getting to the right diagnosis. any history of headache (ha) in your wife's family or your children? how does the headache feel - throbbing pulsating or pressure type? does she get any aura (symptoms) prior to start of her ha such as flashing of lights colors stars black dots etc? did she experience any numbness over face or fingers? describe her ha severity in grade 1-10 1 - minimum and 10 - maximum. what brings her ha and what relieves it? for example sleep food and dark room. is she sensitive to noise and sound during her ha? does she get nausea or vomiting with these ha? does she get any redness in eyes tearing in eyes (left eye) with these ha? does she have any motion sickness brain freeze with ice cream or wet hands? does she take any medicine for these ha? since your ha frequency are frequent (when they occur they occur as multiple episodes in a day). once i have answers to these questions i would discuss about management (drugs). in the interim it is good and reassuring that ct head is normal which tells you there is no mass occupying lesion or increase icp (intracranial pressure). also mild increase in tsh (thyroid stimulating hormone) should not be associated with her ha. things she should do in the interim are drink water 2 l per day and keep herself well hydrated. exercise daily and run 2 km at 4 km/hour speed at least. have a good sleep for eight hours a day. revert back with the answers for the above questions to a neurologist online  
i say this all the time too. then i started to write down every single thing that went into my mouth. i was not eating as i thought. try that. also only eat brown rice. you also need meat. fruit potatoes and rice have tons of sugar in them. it may be natural but it still ends up as fat on your body. try just lean meats vegetables and high fiber carbs. exercise is only 10% of weight loss. it is all about what you are eating. and you are not eating properly. where is the calcium? eggs? yogurt?

you know when a girl starts menstruating just like our perimenopausal girls the adolescent teenager can have irregular cycles up to three years after she starts her period but hopefully once she gets out of the irregular cycles a normal menstrual cycle is between 21 to 35 days and usually bleeding somewhere between 4 to 7 days. heavy bleeding light bleeding does it matter? i always tell the girls that if their cycles are heavier than a pad an hour or they are passing clots or their bleeding extends longer than 7 days that they should call the gynecologist.
first there are many forms of arthritis each of which differ in the do's and don'ts of diet. so the answer is that it depends to some degree on the form of arthritis. persons with gouty arthritis should tend to avoid red meats shellfish alcohol and dehydration. at the same time dairy products such as low-fat milk and yogurt as well as adequate hydration are encouraged in persons with gout. persons with inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis may benefit by taking the omega-3 fatty acids that are in the oils of fish particularly salmon. those with osteoarthritis might benefit from the food supplement glucosamine.
"just as there are many different kinds of seizures there are many different kinds of epilepsy. doctors have identified hundreds of different epilepsy syndromes  disorders characterized by a specific set of symptoms that include epilepsy. some of these syndromes appear to be hereditary. for other syndromes the cause is unknown. epilepsy syndromes are frequently described by their symptoms or by where in the brain they originate. people should discuss the implications of their type of epilepsy with their doctors to understand the full range of symptoms the possible treatments and the prognosis. people with absence epilepsy have repeated absence seizures that cause momentary lapses of consciousness. these seizures almost always begin in childhood or adolescence and they tend to run in families suggesting that they may be at least partially due to a defective gene or genes. some people with absence seizures have purposeless movements during their seizures such as a jerking arm or rapidly blinking eyes. others have no noticeable symptoms except for brief times when they are ""out of it. "" immediately after a seizure the person can resume whatever he or she was doing. however these seizures may occur so frequently that the person cannot concentrate in school or other situations. childhood absence epilepsy usually stops when the child reaches puberty. absence seizures usually have no lasting effect on intelligence or other brain functions. temporal lobe epilepsy or tle is the most common epilepsy syndrome with focal seizures. these seizures are often associated with auras. tle often begins in childhood. research has shown that repeated temporal lobe seizures can cause a brain structure called the hippocampus to shrink over time. the hippocampus is important for memory and learning. while it may take years of temporal lobe seizures for measurable hippocampal damage to occur this finding underlines the need to treat tle early and as effectively as possible. neocortical epilepsy is characterized by seizures that originate from the brain's cortex or outer layer. the seizures can be either focal or generalized. they may include strange sensations visual hallucinations emotional changes muscle spasms convulsions and a variety of other symptoms depending on where in the brain the seizures originate. there are many other types of epilepsy each with its own characteristic set of symptoms. many of these including lennox-gastaut syndrome and rasmussen's encephalitis begin in childhood. children with lennox-gastaut syndrome have severe epilepsy with several different types of seizures including atonic seizures which cause sudden falls and are also called drop attacks. this severe form of epilepsy can be very difficult to treat effectively. rasmussen's encephalitis is a progressive type of epilepsy in which half of the brain shows continual inflammation. it sometimes is treated with a radical surgical procedure called hemispherectomy. some childhood epilepsy syndromes such as childhood absence epilepsy tend to go into remission or stop entirely during adolescence whereas other syndromes such as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and lennox-gastaut syndrome are usually present for life once they develop. seizure syndromes do not always appear in childhood however. epilepsy syndromes that are easily treated do not seem to impair cognitive functions or development and usually stop spontaneously are often described as benign. benign epilepsy syndromes include benign infantile encephalopathy and benign neonatal convulsions. other syndromes such as early myoclonic encephalopathy include neurological and developmental problems. however these problems may be caused by underlying neurodegenerative processes rather than by the seizures. epilepsy syndromes in which the seizures and/or the person's cognitive abilities get worse over time are called progressive epilepsy. several types of epilepsy begin in infancy. the most common type of infantile epilepsy is infantile spasms clusters of seizures that usually begin before the age of 6 months. during these seizures the infant may bend and cry out. anticonvulsant drugs often do not work for infantile spasms but the seizures can be treated with acth (adrenocorticotropic hormone) or prednisone."
a friend from long island and thus always a great skeptic sent me an advertisement from an airline magazine. apparently the face trainer is a helmet-mask device that works out facial muscles for a natural looking lip.  the advertisement says no creams no injections no fuss â€“ just 10 minutes a day and your face trainer is all you need to look younger and healthier.  the advertisement further states in a 60-day clinical trial participants achieved 71% reduction in sagging skin.  i found that quite amazing but im not sure what the clinical trial was. i wonder if i asked for a copy of this clinical trial if they would have one for me. i certainly did not see anything about it in a recognized medical journal. if any product were that good you can bet i would know about it by now. i wish life was that easy where all we had to do was wear a device and somehow our anatomy magically changes. our skin would look younger become tighter and all sags and bags would just go away. wow! this would be real progress. sometimes i find these types of advertisements offensive because they demean the intelligence of the reader. despite the proclamation that products like this will give your face a lift without needles or knives  dont expect a miracle. and those well-chosen words without needles or knives are deliberately crafted by the writer of the ad to incite terror in the readers brain. to scare you so that you make the emotional part of your brain believe this device can do what the common sense part of your brain says it cannot do. remember when something seems too good to be true it usually is.

there may be nothing that you or her mother can do. she is 19 years old and definitely emancipated with five babies. while we may all agree that having more babies are not in her best interest there is really no one who could legally force her to get sterilized or to use birth control. she can be counseled about birth control  suggesting a good reliable contraception that she does not have to think about  such as an iud or implant but in the end the choice is still left up to her.
lice are tiny parasites that live on human beings and feed on blood. they seldom cause serious medical problems but they are both annoying and contagious. there are three types of lice that can live on people. head lice ( pediculus humanus capitis ) are about the size of a sesame seed or 2. 1 to 3. 3 millimeters long when adults. their eggs called nits are barely visible whitish or yellow ovals which attach to human hair shafts. having head lice isn't related to degree of personal hygiene. head lice are contagious especially among schoolchildren. they afflict an estimated 6 million to 12 million children in the united states each year. more girls get head lice  likely because girls have more physical contact with one another and share more personal articles (such as hats clothing combs) that can transmit head lice. head lice are rare among african-americans possibly because the shafts of their hair have a shape that lice cannot grasp easily. pubic lice ( pthirus pubis ) are yellow-gray insects found in the pubic region and transmitted by sexual contact. they are only 1. 1 to 1. 8 mm long and are also called crab lice or crabs because of their shape and the crab-like claw-like front legs with which they cling to hair. eggs can barely be seen; these tiny white particles attach so firmly to hair shafts that they are not removed by normal washing. sometimes pubic lice may be found in other areas of the body containing coarse hair such as armpits or the chest. body lice ( pediculus humanus corporis ) are nearly identical in appearance to head lice but may be more difficult to find. adults grow to 2. 3 to 3. 6 mm long. when not feeding they tend to hide in the seams of clothing and folds of bedding. if the lice are not treated the person can develop complications such as skin sores or bacterial infection of the affected area. body lice can also spread blood infections. lice live successfully all over the world wherever people gather in close proximity such as in schools.

"i don't know how you were diagnosed or if the strep diagnosis was correct. if it was a rapid strep test or culture then the diagnosis would be accurate and the keflex should be helpful. if it was just a ""look and see"" diagnosis based solely on appearance then i would question that you have strep. if you have a viral infection even mono the antibiotic would be totally ineffective."
your abdomen is distended with gases and it gets relieved by sleeping as the capacity of your intrabdominal increases while sleeping but this causes chest pressure and pain that could be an ibs stop taking caffeine. soda. fatty foods eat fibers. drink water relaxation and yoga would helpas well as walking helps the intestinal peristalsis
what you're experiencing sounds awful. i hope you get some relief soon! i strongly suggest you see a health care provider to evaluate these symptoms. sometimes things like leg pains in children don't need to be treated but you're an adult now and still have the pain. that definitely deserves to be looked at. the migraines may or may not be related to the leg pain. anyone can develop migraines. many people believe they have migraines when they actually have common headaches. migraines are a very specific type of headache that requires special treatment. only a health care provider can tell you if you are getting true migraines or not. again i urge you to see a health care provider about this. and i wish you all the best!
your vague description is really not sufficient to make this important diagnostic call. the only way that your husband can be properly diagnosed is to see a medical professional/dermatologist for a hands-on examination.
spacers are great tools especially with inhalers lately. many people have had changes in their inhalers. the older inhalers used a different type of gas or what we called a cfc gas. that was actually banned last year due to environmental laws. so inhalers that people would use for their asthma have actually changed and now theyll see the letters hfa after them. there are some differences and one of the biggest ones is the fact that the spray comes out differently. so ive had a lot of patients come back telling me that their medication doesnt work or well the other thing i found out is that theyre not really using their inhaler the right way. they have to retrain themselves. the spacers a great opportunity especially for children or older adults who may not have a steady hand and cant coordinate their breathing the right way. its a plastic tube and you put the inhaler on one end and your mouth on the other and when you spray it the medication goes into this chamber and therefore you can breathe in and out and get your breathing down; so therefore the medication travels to where it needs to go. its well worth the money. i know sometimes a lot of people dont wanna purchase it because its usually not covered under insurance; but theyre washable and theyre really great and with the kids they come with a little fun mask or little you know cartoons on it to make it seem like you know its not this traumatic experience. but they really do benefit in helping people get the right amount of medication.
hi laila she really needs go and see the surgeon who did it and by the sound of it got it wrong this would be her best starting place and see what happen there. hope this helps you. good luck
if you currently receive health insurance at work you likely don't need to do anything. the marketplaces are for people who either buy insurance on their own or have none now. in fact if your company offers you affordable health insurance (defined as no more than 9. 5% of your annual income and covering on average 60% of your medical costs) you won't want to switch plans. i just wrote about this issue on the health reform 101 blog in greater detail. that will help to better explain why sticking with employer-based health insurance is for most people the right way to go.
anything that is hitting the two+ year mark in your pantry you should probably think about tossing. over time spices lose their flavor. if you continue to use old spices you are essentially putting colored dust into your food. buy as much of your spices in the bulk section of your local market or natural food store as you can. you will pay so much less and you can buy the small amounts of what you need. instead of paying $7. 00 for a jar of turmeric you may pay $0. 20 for the 2 tablespoons you will actually utilize this year. there are a few items that last longer than others. whole nutmegs whole cinnamon whole peppercorns or other whole items can last up to a year longer than their already ground counterparts.

a place to start is 5-2-1-0: 5 servings of fruits and veggies per day (1/2 cup per serving) 1 hr of moderate or greater exercise ~0 sugary drinks (drink lots of water instead) other proven tips include eating breakfast eating more meals cooked at home getting enough sleep. a visit to your doctor would be important to look for complications and to think about medical causes. a nutritionist is also a great idea to customize a nutrition plan. one other tip try to incorporate exercise into her favorite activities. if she loves to read then consider some mini-exercise pedals so she can work out while reading. or maybe when watching tv have her dance or do jumping jacks during the show.

most helpful answer the important thing is that you understand why the dessert is in your meal plan. talking with your therapist is key because he or she is likely doing it to help change your relationship with food. the tendency with eating disorders/disordered eating is people give too much power to a single food instead of looking at the overall pattern of eating. as for your health no eating a sweet food everyday will not ruin your health (i do it! ) especially when your diet is balanced. it's the extremes that are harmful  eating sweets/chips/empty calorie foods all day long or eliminating so many foods/items that it's hard to maintain a healthy weight and enjoy eating. i hope that helps. good luck on your journey!

"methergine (methylergonovine) is an ""ergotamine"" type of medication. it is on the market as a treatment for uterine bleeding (that is the fda approved use). similar medications were used to treat headaches in the past. it should work for migraine. it is a very strong blood vessel constrictor and has a number of serious side effects (some of the side effects caused by long term use could be permanent). we don't use this medication in our clinic so i'm not sure how long it should take to work."

"you are correct. it is early. most ents wait three months of persistent middle ear fluid before even considering tubes as a therapeutic approach. a week-and-a-half is nothing. many children with a middle ear infection will have some residual fluid for a while so we just ""watch and wait "" unless your child has profound hearing loss or other health issues."
no single test can diagnose osteoarthritis. most doctors use a combination of the following methods to diagnose the disease and rule out other conditions: clinical history the doctor begins by asking the patient to describe the symptoms and when and how the condition started as well as how the symptoms have changed over time. the doctor will also ask about any other medical problems the patient and close family members have and about any medications the patient is taking. accurate answers to these questions can help the doctor make a diagnosis and understand the impact the disease has on your life. physical examination the doctor will check the patients reflexes and general health including muscle strength. the doctor will also examine bothersome joints and observe the patients ability to walk bend and carry out activities of daily living. x rays doctors take x rays to see how much joint damage has been done. x rays of the affected joint can show such things as cartilage loss bone damage and bone spurs. but there often is a big difference between the severity of osteoarthritis as shown by the x ray and the degree of pain and disability felt by the patient. also x rays may not show early osteoarthritis damage before much cartilage loss has taken place. magnetic resonance imaging also known as an mri magnetic resonance imaging provides high-resolution computerized images of internal body tissues. this procedure uses a strong magnet that passes a force through the body to create these images. doctors often use mri tests if there is pain; if x-ray findings are minimal; and if the findings suggest damage to other joint tissues such as a ligament or the pad of connective tissue in the knee known as the meniscus. other tests the doctor may order blood tests to rule out other causes of symptoms. he or she may also order a joint aspiration which involves drawing fluid from the joint through a needle and examining the fluid under a microscope.

the real question is what type of back pain are you having? is it constant or intermittent? if it comes and goes you may be having contractions and should contact your physician. if it is constant then it most likely is related to nerve impingement related to the pregnancy. exercise is a very good idea. you may want to take a warm bath keeping the water temperature less than 104 degrees preferably around 100. this may be relieving. depending on what the pain is your physician can possibly provide you with ideas on how to better handle the problem. there are different exercises alternative type of therapies and there are safe medications that can be used to help as well.
diet sodas should not make arthritis worse otherwise the sales of these popular drinks would plummet. there are new studies all of the time linking various things to bodily ailments but i have no heard of a diet soda/arthritis link. if i did i would certainly stop the diet sodas for my own arthritis. there is no nutritional value in them and the use of artificial sweeteners in them is of enough concern that i would try & find a healthier way to quench my thirst not to mention the cancer causing caramel coloring found in them. the artificial sweetner has been shown to make some people feel like they have the flu its just a general achiness not any stomach problems.

if i had the list of prescriptions you are taking now perhaps i could be of more help. amphetamines are in a class of drug called sympathomimetic amines and some decongestants (like pseudoephedrine) and even some combination cold medicines can cause a false-positive result. some over-the-counter weight loss medications often contain them. just give the list to your doctor and have him/her figure it out. if you have not been taking any amphetamines then just have the test repeated.
no insulin is not the cause. just having diabetes can predispose a person to have a uti or other infections.
wow! sounds like your really working hard and eating clean. however to fuel weight loss you need to change your program and your going to be surprised by my suggestions. 1. eat more first 1250 calories is not enough for a 60 year old. the recommended amount of calories for a 60 year old is 1600 calories for women and 2000 calories for men. while these are estimates your pretty far away from both. your body is not going to let go of any fat that it has. it believes your starving so it's holding on to all the calories it can. i know its counter-intuitive but up the calories (to a reasonable level) to lose the weight. add more veggies at least one more serving of protein and some healthy fats (olive oil avocados eggs nuts olives seeds) 2. exercise less if your doing eight hours of cardiovascular exercise a week a great deal of it is probably long slow distance training. you need to change it up. begin interval training. shorter duration but higher intensity. look at the articles pasted below as they map out a step by step approach incorporating interval training into your fitness plan. once again i know it's counter-intuitive that less time equals more weight loss but the weight loss is spurred on by the higher intensity. -interval training: how to do it -benefits of interval training re-evaluate your strength training workouts by asking yourself am i getting stronger and am i seeing changes? with a caloric intake of 1250 calories your probably not. so increase the calories and change your routine. visit the link below and incorporate 1 or 2 of the lifts in each section into your routine. strength training program for men remember challenge yourself but don't overdue it. finally it sounds like your really working hard and initially you probably had success but your body has adapted to the program and it's time to change it up. since these suggestions are a significant change in your exercise program be sure to check with your physician especially if you have any health conditions.
"growing hair is natural. for mammals but if you are talking about growing hair after baldness or loss of hair after a skin disease then the answer can only be achieved by seeing a dermatologist. some hair is completely lost and will not re-grow naturally or otherwise. some hair loss can be temporary and naturally grow back but as far as i know there are no scientifically-proven ""natural"" remedies to make this happen."

"there may be special state and local laws for disposal of used needles and syringes. your health care provider should provide you with instructions on how to properly dispose of your used syringes and needles. always follow those instructions. the instructions below should be used as a general guide for proper disposal. the needles and syringes should never be reused. place all used needles and syringes in a puncture-proof disposable container that is available through your pharmacy or health care provider. you may also use a hard plastic container with a screw-on cap (like a laundry detergent container). do not use glass or clear plastic containers for disposal of needles and syringes. the container should be clearly labeled ""used syringes and needles. "" when the container is about two-thirds full tighten the lid. tape the cap or lid to make sure it does not come off. dispose of the container as instructed by your health care provider. do not throw the container in your household trash. do not recycle. always keep the container out of reach of children."
i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds miserable and worrisome. i want to emphasize your need to stay hydrated even if drinking water gives you nausea. maybe try drinking water at different temperatures to see if one is more palatable than another. or see if there's a vitamin water flavored water or type of sports drink you can tolerate. despite the fact you've been tested for celiac and other conditions in the past my advice to you is to keep pursuing a cause for your symptoms. some conditions take a long time to be diagnosed such as gastroparesis. sometimes tests need to be repeated periodically and the results compared in order to reach a diagnosis. it's ok to be very pro-active with your health care providers in pushing for additional testing or repeated tests (depending on how much time has elapsed) in order to get a diagnosis. i'd suggest keeping copies of all your lab results and imaging films. usually these can be provided to you on cds for easy storage. you'll want to keep these for new doctors you may consult and for comparison of test results over time. i wish i had some magic suggestion to offer you in terms of a diagnosis but that's not the case. like i said hang in there and don't give up just because you've had a few tests done. keep going back to your provider(s) to let them know you still have symptoms. i wish you all the best!
"you don't have insurance and i can't see them over the internet so we have a dilemma. the only way that you can get an accurate diagnosis is for him to see a medical provider or dermatologist but your guess is very good. these may indeed be molluscum contagiosum  very common childhood skin eruption. if you didn't see the ""dent"" in the middle (called an umbilication) look closer with a magnifying glass. it may be there."

it is more likely that you have a severe anxiety or ocd about having medical issues which have not been confirmed by your doctors after a proper examination. your symptoms are more likely psychogenic. it would be best that you consult a psychiatrist and seek proper help to manage your anxiety.
so sorry to hear you're going through this! how unpleasant. many conditions could cause the symptoms you're describing. anything from food poisoning to the flu could be at work here. if you spike a fever (over 101 degrees) then it's time to seek medical attention. if you don't have a thermometer for taking your temperature i recommend you get one. it's impossible to determine whether or not someone has a fever by simply feeling their forehead or judging by whether they're sweating or things like that. you really need to get a thermometer and measure your temperature accurately. if you're not feverish then you probably can take a wait-and-see attitude. drink plenty of fluids and don't try eating anything while you're actively vomiting or nauseated (sick to your stomach). if the symptoms continue to get worse if you get a fever or if you get sharp pains on the right side of your abdomen then it would be a good idea to see a health care provider. i hope you feel better soon! also i keep rotating between overheating and overcooling. have been keeping my sweater on anyways.
potassium supplements should not interfere with pd medications. however too high or too low levels of potassium may produce neurological symptoms or potentially make pd symptoms a bit worse. if you are concerned about this a simple blood test by your doctor can make sure your potassium is in the right range.

the most probable cause of your hair issues could be due to pcod (polycystic ovarian disease). the most common pattern of hair involvement in pcod is male pattern baldness thinning of hair and dandruff. you may consult with your obgyn for continued and proper treatment of your ovarian cysts. in case you had genetically thin hair by birth you cannot increase the thickness of the hair but a well-balanced diet that includes plenty of growth-promoting protein and iron can make a difference eating a healthy diet (rich in vitamin e b complex vitamins and high protein content) will help you will grow stronger and healthier hair. examples - seafoods like salmon chicken and turkey oysters eggs low-fat dairy products like skim milk and yogurt ground flaxseed dark green leafy vegetables carrots beans and legumes (kidney beans lentils etc) nuts (walnuts cashews pecas and almonds) whole grain products (bread fortified cereals etc).
most people develop lifetime immunity to chickenpox after the first occurrence and never experience it again. but the virus can sometimes resurface later in life as shingles (zoster). the current aim in the u. s. and many other countries is to achieve universal (or nearly universal) immunization of children with the chickenpox vaccine. the vaccination requires only two shots. the first vaccination is given at about 1 year of age and the second (booster) is given at 4 years of age. if an older person has not had chickenpox the shot may be given at any time. there have been few significant adverse reactions to the chickenpox vaccine. all children except those with a compromised immune system should have the vaccination. vaccination has been associated with a 90% decrease in the incidence of chickenpox and significantly lower complication rates in those who do develop the symptoms.
the vast majority of people have no idea how that got herpes simplex (fever blisters colds sores). since tens of millions of people have them including some of your relatives or friends you can probably blame one of them. the virus can remain live on surfaces for hours so yes you could have got it from your housekeeping job. just about anywhere.
most helpful answer without the ability to look inside your ears i can only guess but the most likely cause of your ear bleeding was a spontaneous rupture of your eardrum. this can happen from colds or middle ear infections. this is not an emergency but it would be good for you to see your medical provider next week so you can be properly examined. if you are having ear pain or fever then seeing a medical provider sooner would be appropriate.
one of the hardest parts about controlling anxiety is that severe anxiety can actually cause physical symptoms that lead to more anxiety. many of those with anxiety start to worry about their health because the symptoms can be so disabling that it's hard to convince your mind that anxiety could be causing them. this is often the case with vertigo. vertigo itself is not technically an anxiety symptom but dizziness â€“ which is often confused with the idea of vertigo â€“ very much is and it's actually a surprisingly common one. since vertigo is almost exclusively caused by hyperventilation the best way to stop the feeling of having vertigo is to make sure that you're not hyperventilating anymore. often this is easier said than done. in the middle of an anxiety attack it's very hard to re-gain control of your breathing. but there are tricks that make the process easier now the trick here is a nice brown paper bag this you put over you head and re-breath your output works all the time. do hope this helps you. good luck ps try getting your life together that would help cut down your problems.

"clostridium difficile (or c. diff ) is a bacterium that lives naturally in the human gut. however usually when people refer to "" c. diff "" they're referring to c. diff colitis which is an infectious diarrhea caused when c. diff bacteria grow unchecked. the most common cause of c. diff colitis is disruption of the normal balance of bacteria in the gut due to taking antibiotics. it's important to understand c. diff is highly contagious. it spreads through direct contact. so if a person has c. diff diarrhea and soils the bedding which then touches the nightstand as you're taking the sheets off the bed you can pick up the c. diff bacteria from the nightstand and become infected yourself. c. diff colitis is a nasty condition. it's painful and annoying (all those bathroom trips). beyond the annoyance it can cause life-threatening dehydration in children and the elderly. any time a person gets diarrhea that persists after finishing a course of antibiotics they should consult their medical provider to determine if they have a case of c. diff. c. diff usually is treated with one or more courses of oral antibiotics. other therapies may include fluids (to avoid dehydration) and probiotic supplements to help restore the balance of flora in the gut. if you suspect you or a loved one has c. diff colitis it's imperative you avoid spreading it. you must use alcohol-based hand rub every time you go to the bathroom or have contact with a person who has c. diff. washing your hands with soap and water will not kill this bacterium. wear medical gloves when dealing with soiled linen  and also use hand rub. you also need to wash bedding towels and even clothing in hot water preferably with chlorine bleach. i sincerely hope neither you nor a loved one ever has to experience a c. diff infection. wishing you well!"

"unfortunately it would not be possible for me or any medical provider for that matter to be able to offer you a diagnosis blindly over the internet. not only do you need to be carefully examined but the doctor will need to take a thorough medical history and order some diagnostic lab tests. it would not be possible or prudent to guess what may be causing ""pain all over your body"" so you will need to see a medical professional to start the diagnostic process."

you mention your weight all day but how does your weight look every week? are you gaining 11-13 poiunds a day every week or is your weight relatively the same every week? your weight can easily fluctuate that much during a single day and that doesn't mean much as far as overall weight goes. weigh yourself once a week and see how your weight looks one week to another. my weight usually fluctuates around 8-12 pounds a day but week to week it's usually about the same. my boyfriend can have his weight fluctuate as much as 20 pounds a day but his weight stays about the same one week to another. remember to weigh yourself at apporximately the same time every week (for example weigh yourself first thing in the morning before you eat every friday or something like that). weighing yourself multiple times a day will only make you frustrated believe me i know! good luck!

categorized as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated these unsaturated fats can actually improve your cholesterol profile by reducing your ldl (bad cholesterol) and boosting your hdl (good cholesterol). sources of monounsaturated fats include olive oil canola oil avocado and nuts. corn oil safflower oil and soy oil provide polyunsaturated fats. probably the best type of polyunsaturated fats are omega-3 fatty acids. found in fatty fish walnuts and flaxseed these fats not only improve cholesterol profiles but have been associated with a lower risk of heart disease and abnormal heart rhythms. the more the better.

that is difficult to say but at least some of the tamiflu may have been absorbed. you are probably taking tamiful twice per day for five days so you can wait until the next dose is due. hopefully you will not vomit this one. i do not feel that taking an extra dose now would be prudent. if for some reason that you vomit again you need to consult your treating medical provider.
you can prevent high blood pressure by: maintaining a healthy weight. getting regular exercise. reducing salt intake. drinking alcohol in moderation if at all. reducing stress. other things like dietary supplements may also help prevent high blood pressure. here's a roundup of what's being said about them. potassium. eating foods rich in potassium will help protect some people from developing high blood pressure. calcium. populations with low calcium intakes have high rates of high blood pressure. however it has not been proven that taking calcium tablets will prevent high blood pressure. but it is important to be sure to get at least the recommended amount of calcium from the foods you eat. dairy foods like low-fat selections of milk yogurt and cheese are good sources of calcium. magnesium. a diet low in magnesium may make your blood pressure rise. but doctors don't recommend taking extra magnesium to help prevent high blood pressure  the amount you get in a healthy diet is enough. magnesium is found in whole grains green leafy vegetables nuts seeds and dry peas and beans. fish oils. a type of fat called omega-3 fatty acids is found in fatty fish like mackerel and salmon. large amounts of fish oils may help reduce high blood pressure but their role in prevention is unclear. taking fish oil pills is not recommended because high doses can cause unpleasant side effects. the pills are also high in fat and calories. of course most fish if not fried or made with added fat is low in saturated fat and calories and can be eaten often. garlic. there has been some evidence to suggest garlics effect in lowering blood pressure in addition to improving cholesterol and reducing some cancers. always talk to your doctor before taking a dietary supplement or alternative herbal treatment. some may interact with other medications you may be taking or have harmful side effects.

when a woman feels an intense desire to get pregnant which may be because of infertility repeat miscarriages impending menopause or a desire to get married her body may produce some of the signs of pregnancy (such as a swollen belly enlarged breasts and even the sensation of fetal movement). the woman's brain then misinterprets those signs as pregnancy and triggers the release of hormones (such as estrogen and prolactin) that lead to actual pregnancy symptoms. some researchers have suggested that poverty a lack of education childhood sexual abuse or relationship problems might play a role in triggering false pregnancy.
first i'm sorry to hear you have been diagnosed with human papillomavirus (hpv) but i'm glad to hear you're getting regular pap smears. unfortunately your partner may already be infected. even without external genital warts or other symptoms you can spread the virus through mere contact during sexual intercourse. and use of a condom isn't necessarily protective either since a condom doesn't cover all the skin areas that may come in contact with the virus. the good news is that serious complications or cancers from hpv in heterosexual men with healthy immune systems is rare. in fact in both your cases the virus may clear up on its own over the course of a couple of years. (though this is less likely if you're passing it back and forth. ) both you and your boyfriend should be alert for signs of genital warts on his penis or scrotum. if you notice anything resembling genital warts he should try to see a doctor for a diagnosis. really the only way to diagnose hpv in men is through physical examination during an outbreak of the warts. if you have additional questions about this don't hesitate to ask your gynecologist. hpv is incredibly common. it's estimated that up to 50% of sexually active men and women will contract hpv at some point in their lives. take care!

"well it's a good question. motivation is the challenge of every person who wants to achieve a goal be it weight loss becoming an oil painter or anything else. it sounds like you may have invested too much time and effort into research. everything feels overwhelming to you right now doesn't it? don't let that stop you. at a certain point you have to take the plunge and do it. stop thinking about it and just do it. i read an interesting article in which a fitness coach said there is no such thing as ""motivation;"" there are only choices. you can choose to eat an apple or you can choose to eat a candy bar. you can choose to take a walk for 10 minutes or you can choose to watch tv instead. do you see the difference here? i strongly suggest you and your friend check out webmd's diet community where you can share your fears struggles goals and successes with others who will cheer you on! you are not the first person to fear getting started on the path to a healthy life and you won't be the last. meanwhile choose goals you know you can easily accomplish. for example: today i will eat one apple instead of a candy bar today i will throw away all the junk food in my house today i will walk for 10 minutes this week i will walk for 10 minutes every day i mean come on! anyone can do 10 minutes of exercise right? of course you can! lastly don't forget to reward yourself for meeting your goals no matter how small they may be. don't use food as a reward. even if you accomplish just one thing today download a new song to your smartphone take a bubble bath or do something else to celebrate the fact that today at least you won. you don't need ""motivation. "" you just need to take the plunge. i say go for it! wishing you well!"
hi it will very likely just stop soon. nothing is however guaranteed. don't let your period spoil your vacation. as a matter of fact don't let it spoil anything ever. menstruation is not a disability. it is a fact of life and hundreds of millions of women menstruate every day without it spoiling anything. learn to deal with it effectively and enjoy life. as for being pregnant i don't think so with a 7 day plus period. the only real time to worry is if you miss your period then you can worry good luck
shadowing is following mimicking and interrupting behaviors that people with dementia may exhibit.
absolutely not. lifting weights will not only help you lose weight but maintain the loss. here's why: muscle keeps your metabolism revved up burning calories fat and glucose (sugar). when you lose weight up to 25% of the loss may come from muscle resulting in a slower metabolism. weight lifting will help preserve or rebuild any muscle you lose by dieting. muscle helps you with aerobic exercise. the stronger you are the better you will be at any aerobic activity. weight training improves your body's muscle-to-fat ratio (you end up with less body fat and more muscle) which improves both your health and your fitness level. gaining muscle will help you look better as you define and tone your physique. building strength helps you feel good about yourself. although the scale may show a slight weight gain when you start lifting weights (usually five pounds or less) you probably won't look heavier because the gain is in muscle and your clothes may even fit more loosely. strength training along with cardiovascular exercise can boost your metabolism and can help you expend calories to lose weight. strength training however also has the added benefit of helping you to preserve muscle as well. if you lose weight while only doing cardiovascular exercise some of the weight loss may come from body fat as well as muscle. you want to preserve muscle because it can help to keep your metabolism elevated since muscle burns calories at a higher rate than fat. strength training can also help to promote a more toned appearance which would be another added benefit to you as well. the surgeon general recommends that you strength train all major muscle groups two or more days per week. consult your doctor before starting an exercise routine. no you should remaind that it's a continuous process. if you stop it your weight will start increasing.

"migraines with aura account for less than 20% of all migraines. but that's little comfort when you are the one who falls victim to this painful headache. headache is considered the symptom common to all types of migraines  although a few children experience an aura without a headache. migraine pain usually occurs in the front of the head on one or both sides of the temples. it may throb or be steady. the headache may last from four to 72 hours. other symptoms of migraine may include any of these: nausea vomiting yawning irritability low blood pressure feeling ""hyper"" sensitivity to light sounds or motion dark colors under the eyes a migraine with aura comes with additional symptoms which often begin about 30 minutes or less before the headache. these early symptoms are called a prodrome. the prodrome or aura may last for five to 20 minutes or it may continue even after the headache subsides. symptoms of aura include: blind spots or scotomas blindness in half of your visual field in one or both eyes (hemianopsia) seeing zigzag patterns (fortification) seeing flashing lights (scintilla) feeling prickling skin (paresthesia) weakness seeing things that aren't really there (hallucinations)."
the tibia is a weight-bearing bone and it takes quite an impact to break it however a person can have an occult or stress fracture of this bone. if this has not improved in a week it would be wise to consider a hands-on examination and an x-ray. in stress fractures the x-ray may be negative so your medical provider may need to get a bone scan if you continue to be symptomatic.
generally speaking she can be around other kids once her fever has been gone for 24 hours and she is feeling better. if your child has been placed on an antibiotic for any reason she should receive the medication for at least 24 hours before being around other children. if you kept your child home every time he had the sniffles he'd never be in school. and the older he gets the harder it is to make up missed schoolwork. so if he feels okay and doesn't have a fever he should be in school. but if your child has a fever (temperature over 100. 3) is vomiting having bad diarrhea coughing up a storm has pain interfering with activity or really isn't feeling well keep him at home until these symptoms are under control. often it's the milder symptoms (such as slight runny nose and cough) that leave parents wondering what to do. only you can make that game-day decision but be considerate of others. before you take him out think to yourself would i want another child with the same symptoms around my son? you can always check with your child care or preschool. they may have specific guidelines for when previously sick children can return. you know your child best so if you think something is wrong don't send him to school. if you're concerned call your pediatrician.
there are certainly many different paths that you can take to eat healthy and there is honestly no one right approach. with that said i personally am weary about any diet that is heavily focused on one central theme or ideology. i dont think that its always good to promote only one certain food or completely omit certain food groups altogether. we know that some foods are generally better than others but there is still a lot left to learn. also a healthy diet should be based on a lifestyle change not something that you follow short-term just to promote a certain result. a healthy diet is one that you can sustain long-term and that doesnt leave you feeling hungry or feeling deprived; so overly restrictive diets arent the answer either. lastly a healthy diet is evidence-based and not something formulated on personal claims or anecdotes. a diet that promises you everything is probably too good to be true. if youre looking for more specific examples this site may help: . hi just google fad diets good or bad your find lots of info there. me i'm a cabbage diet fan which you should find is a fad diet but it works for me you just need to get your head round it for 7 days take a week off eat sensibly then go for it again its good for detoxing as well cleans your system out your see bits about just eating cabbage but you do a whole mix of veg. you can find that out if you google the cabbage diet. but please have fun. do hope this helps. good luck

"because you only spray on a thin layer cooking sprays are great for sautÃ©ing vegetables and lean meats with a small amount of oil. if you check the ingredients label you will see the primary ingredient is vegetable oil. while some are flavored to taste like butter others are flavored to taste like olive oil and may even contain some olive oil. here is an example list of ingredients in one brand of butter-flavored pan spray: soybean oil (adds a very small amount of fat) soy lecithin natural flavors dimethyl silicone (for anti-foaming) beta-carotene (for color) propellant. keep in mind that even cooking sprays labeled as ""zero calories"" can actually contain less than 1 calorie per serving. so they're not completely calorie free. you can actually make your own cooking spray by buying a spray bottle and filling it with healthy oil such as canola or olive oil."

yes some women can carry a full cycle throughout there entire pregnancy.
the answer to this question lies in your individual menstrual cycle. depending on the brand (you need to read the box) you can take a home pregnancy test as early as a day after you miss your period. some tests claim you can test 3 to 4 days before you miss your period but testing too soon can give you a false negative result. it may be better to wait the few extra days to see if you miss your period and then test. for best results i suggest taking the test first thing in the morning when your urine is most concentrated. home pregnancy tests measure the level of human chorionic gonadatropin (hcg) in your urine. this hormone is produced in great quantities beginning shortly after fertilization of an egg occurs. by taking the pregnancy test first thing in the morning you ensure any hcg in your urine is very concentrated and easy for the test to detect. so step one: wait until you miss your period. step two: home pregnancy test. hope this helps!
this very important medical exam component is usually performed standing with the medical provider sitting on a stool. the underwear can be pulled down if the patient is not completely disrobed and wearing a gown. the provider should be wearing gloves. the exam in painless only takes a few minutes checking for inguinal hernias or scrotal or testicular masses. there should be an educational component about self-examination for testicular masses and of course ample time should be provider to address any private questions that the young man may have at the time. the exam is done in private and if possible a same-sex clinician can be requested if the young man is shy.

if you are rh-negative and pregnant if you are an rh-negative woman and you have conceived with an rh-negative partner you are not at risk of rh sensitization during pregnancy. (most health professionals treat all rh-negative pregnant women as though the father might be rh-positive. ) if you are already sensitized to the rh factor your pregnancy will need to be closely monitored to prevent fetal harm. for more information on fetal and newborn treatment see the treatment overview section of this topic. if you are unsensitized rh-negative treatment focuses on preventing rh sensitization during pregnancy and childbirth. rh immune globulin (such as rhogam) is a highly effective treatment for preventing sensitization. to prevent sensitization from occurring late in the pregnancy or during delivery you must have a shot of rh immune globulin around week 28 of your pregnancy. this treatment prevents your immune system from making antibodies against your fetus's rh-positive red blood cells. rh immune globulin injection is also necessary if you have had any vaginal bleeding or an obstetric procedure such as amniocentesis or external cephalic version. if your newborn is rh-positive you are given rh immune globulin again within 72 hours of delivery. by preventing rh sensitization from delivery you are protecting your next rh-positive fetus. if your newborn is rh-negative sensitization cannot happen and no treatment is necessary. rh immune globulin is also necessary after a miscarriage partial molar pregnancy ectopic pregnancy or abortion. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

whether you have to include social security disability as income depends on whether or not it is your sole source of income. if you have other income in addition to your disability benefits they may be taxed otherwise they generally won't be. a good answer is to see whether you included disability income as adjusted gross income when you filed your taxes last year.
that's a very interesting question and i'm glad you asked! being a perioperative nurse i've informed many patients on how to care for themselves when they get home. one piece of advice i usually give is this: don't jump into a hot shower right away. why? because it can cause a quick shift of your body fluids into your legs. if that happens it can cause your blood pressure to drop which can result in lightheadedness or even fainting. even if you haven't had surgery this fluid shift can occur from taking hot showers. you can test this theory yourself by seeing if you feel faint after taking a cooler shower. if not problem solved! meanwhile remember: safety first! if you've been feeling lightheaded after showering you need to make sure to use a shower stool or grab bars to keep yourself from falling. whenever you feel lightheaded (whether in the shower or not) your best bet is to sit down as quickly as possible. sitting down is better than falling down! if your symptoms persist you should consult a health care professional for a physical exam. wishing you well!
since he is a diabetic you need to have him see a doctor right away
protonix and ranitidine can both be used to treat gi ulcers gerd maintenance therapy for ulcer prevention and heartburn. both of these medications block acid production by two different mechanisms. protonix is a proton pump inhibitor while ranitidine prevents gastric acid stimulation by blocking histamine release in the stomach. protonix is prescription strength while ranitidine is over-the-counter. this means that there could be a price difference depending on the co-pays with your health insurance. protonix does have a generic (pantoprazole) that is equally effective as the brand name. if you are thinking about switching without knowing the severity of your stomach condition is it hard to give information as to whether ranitidine can be supplemented for protonix. i recommend that you speak to your health-care provider about your options. these medications do work differently and the effectiveness can be different. if the symptoms have subsided keep in mind that the medication can be the controlling factor. therefore it may not be necessary to switch if your current treatment is working for you.
i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. you should make an appointment for an examination. your balance problems could be caused by something as simple as fluid in the ear or you could be experiencing the early symptoms of something more serious such as parkinson's disease. i don't say that to frighten you only to prompt you to phone your primary care provider to get this checked out. assuming you're not exhibiting any symptoms of stroke you probably do not need to head to the emergency room. just make an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible. if the symptoms suddenly get worse or are accompanied by a high fever difficulty breathing or other serious symptoms then definitely seek immediate medical care. wishing you well! hi off the top of my head see your doctor and have your ears looked at he would be looking for an inner ear infection. do hope this helps you. good luck
seems to be a generalised neuropathic pain. a hrct chest will help to find out the cause of chest pain radiating to back. kidney related issues seem to be more likely and a consultation with a nephrologist should be considered.
epilepsy may develop even though you do not have any risk factors. a cause cannot always be identified. this is especially true in many forms of childhood epilepsy. for some people epilepsy can result from a tumor infection or damage to the brain. children and older adults are most likely to develop epilepsy but it can start at any age. it is possible that epilepsy may run in families but you do not have to have a family history to develop epilepsy. epileptic seizures occur when abnormal bursts of electricity in the brain briefly upset normal brain function. it's not always clear what triggers the bursts of abnormal electrical activity. conditions that can cause seizures include: head injury. stroke or conditions that affect the blood vessels (vascular system) in the brain. hardening of the arteries ( atherosclerosis ) in the brain. brain tumor. brain infection such as meningitis or encephalitis. alzheimer's disease. alcohol or drug abuse or withdrawal. tumors scar tissue from injury or disease or abnormal brain development may damage a specific area of the brain and cause partial seizures. but you may not have any of these conditions and still develop epilepsy. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

hypertension in this age is usually secondary hypertension so there must be a reason for your hypertension you have to check your thyroid function and then get an ultrasound for renal arteries also if you stay in front of the computer long time and you dont get enough sleep then the cause may be increased cortisol hormone which also will need to be assessed
bone is constantly being remodeled. this is the natural healthy state of continuous uptake of old bone (resorption) followed by the deposit of new bone. this turnover is important in keeping bones healthy and in repairing any minor damage that may occur with wear and tear. the cells that lay new bone down are called osteoblasts and the cells responsible for resorption of old bone are called osteoclasts. osteoporosis occurs as a result of a mismatch between osteoclast and osteoblast activity. this mismatch can be caused by many different disease states or hormonal changes. it is also commonly a result of aging the change in normal hormones that occurs after menopause and from diets low in calcium and vitamin d. in osteoporosis osteoclasts outperform osteoblasts so that more bone is taken up than is laid down. the result is a thinning of the bone with an accompanying loss in bone strength and a greater risk of fracture. a thinning bone results in a lower bone density or bone mass. there are two major types of bone. cancellous bone (also known as trabecular bone) is the inner softer portion of the bone and cortical bone is the outer harder layer of bone. cancellous bone undergoes turnover at a faster rate than cortical bone. as a result if osteoclast and osteoblast activity becomes mismatched cancellous bone is affected more rapidly than cortical bone. certain areas in the body have a higher ratio of cancellous bone to cortical bone such as the spine (vertebrae) the wrist (distal radius) and the hips (femoral neck). most of a person's bone mass is achieved by early adulthood. after that time the bone mass gradually declines throughout the rest of a person's life. there is a normal rate of decline in bone mass with age in both men and women. for women in addition to age the menopause transition itself causes an extra degree of bone loss. this bone loss is greatest in the first three to six years after menopause. women can lose up to 20% of their total bone mass during this time. since women generally have a lower bone mass to begin with in comparison with men the ultimate result is a higher risk of fracture in postmenopausal women as compared to men of the same age. nevertheless it is important to remember that men may also be at risk for osteoporosis especially if they have certain illnesses a low testosterone level are smokers take certain medications or are sedentary. the best method to prevent osteoporosis is to achieve as high a bone mass by early adulthood with a proper diet and regular exercise. unfortunately osteoporosis is not often considered during this time in a person's life.
hi do you mean that you had unprotected sex the day after? then no it take sperm 3 days to get in the right place so by then your egg would be gone. just think this and see if it works your cycle around day 14 should be ovulation day give or take a day now it take 3 days for sperm to get in -place and can live for 5 to 10 days depending where you read so you need to be having unprotected sex about day 8 this way the sperm is in place to receive your egg if on day 21 you get spotting then you could be on your way to being pregnant. hope this helps you. good luck
hi if like my wife you keep a little book that tracks your period dates you just have to work it from that if your cycles are normal so its your one in may + 14 days to ovulation day so if you had unprotected sex 3 to 4 days before that then bingo you have found the day or days your looking for. ok its from that period date you work your 9 months from. ok good luck

"when it comes to inexpensive pharmaceuticals you may need to call around to various pharmacies and even planned parenthood and ask prices. i don't think you will find that much variation in price. since this is over the counter insurance may not cover it anyway even if you had it. remember that this is the ""morning after"" pill so you don't have that much time to comparison shop. i can assure you that if you are hoping to prevent a pregnancy as a result of unprotected sex the consequences of not doing this promptly is going to be a lot more expensive if you know what i mean. this method may be pricey if you are on a tight budget but it is too late to use condoms now. they would have been less expensive so lesson learned."

i have a hiatal hernia but i did not have a hernia surgery. but the hiatal hernia in the digestive tract means that you have a muscular weakness. pressure from the gastrointestinal tract may cause a protrusion or herniation of the gut through the weakened wall. such hernias exist in the diaphragmatic area in the anterior abdomen or in the region of the groin. the inguinal hernias are by far the most common. in the hiatal hernia you could be experiencing some nausea vomiting loss of appetite. or it could be overeating or drinking or even spicy foods. eat bland foods crackers soup nothing heavy like steak or brisket or mexican foods. drink diet lemon lime soda try not to drink anything with a lot of sugar. tea is fine and with lemon no sugar. i would call your doctor let him know how you are doing and tell them about the hiatel hernia i am taking protonix 40 mg to help me maybe he can put you on something to help you. but please do call your doctor and let them know how you are doing and please keep us informed of your condition. then send us another email letting us know how you are doing. i do hope that you get to feeling better. thank you.
botox is very safe for frown lines and wrinkles but must be done by trained aesthetic physicians such as dermatologists or plastic surgeons. lasers are also effective in these areas especially when combined with botox.

hi it doesnt seem to be related to the history of tuberculosis. there is a possibility of epididymitis or orchitis that may be causing pain or there is a possibility of renal calculus. you need to get a ultrasound of abdomen done to come to a diagnosis. consult a general surgeon. thanks
yes a person can have a gastointestinal virus without vomiting or diarrhea but those symptoms are typically the things you get. if you had this virus before or a similar virus you may only have a mild infection with nausea. you cannot definitively diagnose a norovirus by symptoms alone since everyone responds to a viral infection differently. yes it is possible to have a stomach virus without vomiting or diarrhea. norovirus may have a prolonged infectious period even before a patient starts feeling sick. people who recover from the infection keep shedding virus through their stools for weeks and may potentially spread the infection to others.
if she had constipation and stool was rock hard there is possibility that she injured her rectum also some foods and medication gives blood apearance like for example too much tomatoes can cause exactly what you described if non of the above then i recommend seeing your pediatric doctorgood luck
sounds like the diagnosis is right. my daughter had it for 2 weeks and only on gums tongue and lips. never on her hands or feet. very painful but it did go away. she was 2 though.
no. the only side effect is that you had to pay for it twice. you will be just fine.
you can't damage yourself with these treatments. if you get salicylic acid on normal skin it can cause burning or redness but never infection or scarring. all you have to do is stop using it on irritated areas and the skin returns to normal. still it's probably better not to use salicylic acid on sensitive areas like the face or groin where it's likely to make nearby skin raw and uncomfortable. it generally is recommended that salicylic acid not be used by people with diabetes or in areas where there is poor circulation because of concern about how normally the skin can heal; however in practice salicylic acid is withheld only when there are clear signs of ongoing inflammation of the skin. likewise nonprescription freezing products are also safe but must be used carefully and only according to package instructions.
"oh ouch! the perils of car repair right? well several things could be going on here. the only way to tell for sure is to visit the doctor for a physical exam and possibly an x-ray. despite the fact you can move the elbow ok it's still possible there's a bone fracture in there or a bone chip. that's worst-case scenario. it's also possible you sustained soft tissue damage. at the ""bottom"" of the triceps muscle where it connects to the elbow joint is a tendon called the ""triceps brachii tendon. "" you may have torn or strained this. also the ulnar nerve is located in the area you injured. if you are experiencing tingling in your pinky finger you may have damaged this nerve. of course there are several ligaments in the elbow that could have been injured as well. if rest doesn't resolve your pain and any other symptoms within a few days it would be worth getting checked out by a doctor. the elbow is a complex joint and you don't want to risk long-term damage by trying to ""wait out"" what could be a treatable injury. best of luck to you!"
apply local cream take anti allergic tablets for itch. consult a dermatologist if it doesnt respond
no. she can suck her thumb. hand foot and mouth disease can affect those three parts equally (and even the diaper area) so sucking her thumb will not spead the infection or make it worse.
i would not exercise right away. and if you have not had an x-ray of it to make sure there is no fracture. keep it elevated until the swelling goes down. it may take weeks for the bruises to go away. if you exercise on it now. the swelling may get worse. suggest you get an x-ray of it to be sure there is no fracture first.
hi some of your symptoms point to a yeast infection now if you have tried antibiotics and it does not clear then give these links a good read all very natural and not a drug in site.      just copy one at a time into goole to the www. to open and read. also google sea salt and the vagina. these may sound a bit out there but for a lot of women they have been a godsend because they work when antibiotics have failed them. to many antibiotics are not good for you they stop antibiotics working when your body really wants them. do hope they work for you. good luck
i don't know the age of your son or if he is having bedwetting issues but frequent night-time urination could be due to many things. for instance if he has a tendency to over-drink liquids in the evening he would more likely need to urinate throughout the night. sometimes little a boy will get irritation of their penis from soaps (not rinsed well after a bath or shower) laundry detergent or dryer softener residuals left in their clothing etc. this can cause an irritant urethritis that makes him feel like he needs to urinate. less common but not out of the question would be a child who is developing diabetes (type 1). it would be wise to discuss this with his medical provider and have some lab tests. another possibility could be a deficiency of a natural hormone called adh (anti-diuretic hormone). the hormone is supposed to keep us from urinating often at night so if there is a deficiency the body will continue to process urine like we were awake during the day. this is one cause of nocturnal enuresis otherwise known as bedwetting. he could potentially be a bed-wetter but instead is just waking up multiple times to urinate; perhaps not sleeping well for fear that he will wet his pants or the bed. if he does have an adh deficiency this can be corrected by a medication called desmopressin (ddavp). his medical provider will be able to determine if this would be helpful. get him in to see his medical provider.
not sure exactly what you have but there are blood tests used to help diagnose arthritis and inflammation. if you haven't had any blood tests done i'd ask your doctor for some.
i'm sorry you're feeling worried about this. let me see if i can help. first of all i'd strongly recommend you discuss your concerns with your doctor. he or she is in the best position to help get you on a course to lower your cholesterol and triglyceride numbers and get your blood sugar under better control. diet medications and a support group can all help in that effort. regarding the result of your lipase test specifically i'm not sure why a result of 90 would get flagged as high. usually the reference range for lipase runs between 10-40 units per liter (u/l) for adults under age 60 and between 18-180 u/l for adults over age 60. even if your lipase results are abnormally high i wouldn't jump right to a conclusion of cancer. several conditions can cause elevated lipase numbers including inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) gallbladder problems and peptic ulcers  just to name a few. your doctor is really the only person who can help you get an accurate diagnosis but i hope this response puts your mind at ease a bit. best wishes to you! my lipase levels were higher than that and it was because of gall stones. at first it felt like i had gas that wouldn't pass. i had my gall bladder removed and within 3 mos. i was back to normal.
not knowing the specific medical information regarding your case a simple phone call to your urologist would most likely answer your question in a more patient-specific manner. hi found you this info on a site called www. drcatalona. com blood in semen after prostatic biopsy: how long after a prostate biopsy can you expect to still have blood in your semen? it is not rare for a man to still have blood in his semen as long as two or three months after a prostatic biopsy. blood in semen following prostate biopsy: relating to one of your other questions - blood in semen after prostatic biopsy which you say may last for 2-3 mos - does it help to clear it any better/faster by increasing the frequency of ejaculation or does further aggravating the prostate in such a way delay healing? there is no solid data on this issue. after a week or so after the biopsy i believe that more frequent ejaculation would help clear the semen. if the blood becomes more bright red (rather than rust colored or brown) it may indicate that the situation is being aggravated. googled this blood in ejaculate after prostate biopsy lots more info all saying much the same just bvy guys who have had the same. hope this helps you. good luck
i would suggest you to apply melalite xl cream (tretinoin) on the black spots at night in minute amounts. please consult your doctor discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. continue this for three weeks and revert back. revert back after three weeks to a dermatologist online 
you have already taken all the tablets but unfortunately you have taken it wrongly. the second dose of 2 tablets of misoprostol were to be taken after 36 hours and not before. the remaining two should have taken after 6 hours of the previous 2. now you must wait for the bleeding and abdominal cramps to initiate on its own in next 48 hours. if the bleeding does not ensue in next 48 hours then get an ultrasound pelvis done to reascertain an intrauterine pregnancy or whether it is an ectopic pregnancy. if intrauterine then safely a surgical abortion can be performed under ultrasound guidance by a gynecologist. there is no role of repeating the kit again. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online  
there are many mono-like viral illnesses with similar symptoms and not all mono blood tests are very accurate. the best is an ebv panel so hopefully this is the test she had. the less-expensive (and less-accurate) mono spot test is not as sensitive. as much as i would like to help you it would not be possible to diagnose your daughter blindly over the internet so you will need to see her medical provider again for further testing if she is not improving. there are too many possibilities to just guess. you better consult with the your doctor. these symptoms can be due to post infection recovery stage and some due to medications ill effect.
helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) is a bacterium that causes inflammation and ulcers in the stomach. about 80% of patients with h. pylori are asymptomatic meaning they do not feel any pain or symptoms. treatment is very important. we must eradicate the bacteria and allow the ulcer to heal. typically treatment is a combination of two antibiotics and 1-2 stomach medications. there are several different effective combinations for treating h. pylori. depending on what your antibiotic allergy is we can find an alternative antibiotic that will safely and effectively eradicate the infection. work with your pharmacist for alternatives. the mastic gum is not going to be as effective in eliminating the bacteria. .
most helpful answer it is unlikely that you would get pregnant from the ejaculation just on your underwear but you can get pregnant from the leakage of semen before ejaculation as you were having unprotected vaginal sex. if you are engaging in this type of risky sexual practices you need to be on an effective contraceptive and your boyfriend must use a condom. or it is only a matter of time until you are pregnant. did you get pregnant this time? i don't know but you should take a pregnancy test if you miss your period or start having any signs of pregnancy. if you do not get pregnant from this careless act out of sheer luck please use this stressful experience as a lesson and don't do this again. hi janette if you play with fire you will get burnt yes well if you have sex with a guy without any kind of bc then at sometime you will get pregnant and that's even if he pulls out as there is a good chance that he could have sperm in his pre-cum all you can do now is wait to see if you get your next period. if its a missed one you do a hpt on your first missed day but you cant get pregnant from sperm on your underwear. you will have to see how things span out if your not pregnant then get some kind of bc and you should always carry condoms may not what he wants but safer than bare back riding. why did you not think of plan b on saturday would have got rid of your worries. do hope there is some help here. good luck there may be the possibility that you're pregnant. make sure to take some pill. abogados madrid abogados en madrid abogados madrid [url= madrid[/url]
there could be a number of things causing this. sometimes women just have really light periods it's normal for this to happen occasionally. light brown blood just means it's been held in the body longer and so isn't as fresh. it could be perimenopause that isn't uncommon and can happen for a few years before true menopause. it could be caused by stress hormonal shifts or any number of other factors. i think a pregnancy is pretty unlikely with the tube-tying you described.
one cup of coffee per day is generally allowed in pregnancy. up to 200mg of caffeine are allowed and most coffee or tea contains 137-150 mg. although some herbs are okay to drink or eat be careful of others that can have an effect on the uterus or blood flow to the uterus. star anise is helpful to increase breastmilk production but not enough is known about it during pregnancy. because of this i would not recommend that you take it during pregnancy. some relatively safe herbs to have during pregnancy include ginger root (for nausea & stomach upset) peppermint leaf and citrus based products. hope this helps. talk to your doctor if you are concerned.
"i have to ask why you want to do this. if we are treating an infant for pain or fever i would recommend the tylenol infant drops only. due to the fact that aspirin can increase the risk of reye's syndrome i would not consider chewable 81 milligram baby aspirin. infants and children are not ""little adults "" so you need to be very careful when it comes to medication."
hi found you this on drugs. com. soma may be harmful to an unborn baby. tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during treatment. it is not known whether soma passes into breast milk or if it could harm a nursing baby. so your answer is no but do see your doctor. good luck
"the fda sets rules for what food manufacturers can call ""light "" ""low "" ""reduced "" ""free "" and other food terms. here's the low-down on these terms: ""healthy"" food must be low in fat with limited cholesterol and sodium. anything labeled ""free"" must only contain tiny amounts of the ingredient in each serving. for example ""trans-fat free"" or ""fat-free"" products can have only 0. 5 mg of trans fats or fat; ""cholesterol-free"" foods can only have two milligrams of cholesterol and two grams of saturated fat. a serving of food labeled ""low sodium"" can have a maximum of 140 milligrams of sodium. a serving of ""low cholesterol"" food can have a maximum of 20 milligrams of cholesterol and two grams of saturated fat. one serving of a ""low-fat"" food can have a maximum of three grams of fat. a serving of a ""low-calorie"" food can have a maximum of 40 calories. a serving of a food labeled ""reduced"" must have 25% less of the ingredient than a serving of the regular version. one serving of a ""light"" food must have 50% less fat or 1/3 fewer calories than the regular version. the food and drug administration (fda) regulates what claims a product can make. the following are a few examples to answer your question: - free. this term means that a product contains no amount of or only trivial or ""physiologically inconsequential"" amounts of one or more of these components: fat saturated fat cholesterol sodium sugars and calories. - low. this term can be used on foods that can be eaten frequently without exceeding dietary guidelines for one or more of these components: fat saturated fat cholesterol sodium and calories. - low-fat : 3 g or less per serving - low-saturated fat : 1 g or less per serving - low-sodium : 140 mg or less per serving - very low sodium : 35 mg or less per serving - low-calorie : 40 calories or less per serving. - low-cholesterol : 20 mg or less and 2 g or less of saturated fat per serving - reduced. this term means that a nutritionally altered product contains at least 25 percent less of a nutrient or of calories than the regular or reference product. however a reduced claim can't be made on a product if its reference food already meets the requirement for a ""low"" claim. - light. this descriptor can mean two things: - that a nutritionally altered product contains one-third fewer calories or half the fat of the reference food. - that the sodium content of a low-calorie low-fat food has been reduced by 50 percent."
eggs have been making the news lately with three major nationwide recalls due to potential contamination with the bacteria salmonella. the recalls involve eggs from wright county and hillandale farms in iowa. but whats the big cluck about it? well if you handle these eggs or eat them partially cooked (a. k. a. poached or soft boiled) you can potentially get pretty sick. salmonella (specifically salmonella enteriditis) is the most common form of bacterial food poisoning. within 12 hours to 3 days after an exposure people develop nasty diarrhea vomiting fever and stomach cramps. unlike the watery diarrhea one typically sees with a stomach virus salmonella usually causes diarrhea mixed with mucus and/or blood. and this lovely infection lasts up to a week. ugh. the good news is that most people fully recover without needing any special treatment or medication. some unlucky people can get dehydrated and end up being hospitalized. and a few very unlucky people can be seriously ill from this infection. that includes young infants people with weakened immune systems and the elderly. besides this iowa egg issue there are other ways to get this bug. so how do you avoid getting salmonella and other forms of food poisoning? 1. make sure to thoroughly wash countertops sinks and cutting boards with soap and water when preparing foods with eggs raw meat or poultry. 2. only prepare fully cooked eggs. 3. make sure hamburger/ground beef is cooked completely until it is brown. yes pink makes a juicier burger but it also makes a germ-filled one. 4. use pasteurized eggs in recipes that call for raw eggs (like caesar salad dressing). 5. keep eggs meat and poultry properly refrigerated. 6. keep all baby bottles pacifiers and breast pump supplies away from food preparation areas. 7. keep pet iguanas or turtles out of the kitchen counter area. (you think i am joking i had a patient get salmonella this way). make sure to wash hands thoroughly after handling. 8. buy only pasteurized apple cider and other juice products. 9. wash hands thoroughly after visiting a petting zoo. take home tip: if you or a family develops diarrhea that is bloody or mucousy its time to call your doctor.
shingles or herpes zoster is caused by the chicken pox virus. once you have had chicken pox the virus remains dormant in your body. when this virus reawakens it causes a blistering rash called shingles. if shingles affects the trigeminal nerve on the face it can cause sores to appear on one side of the mouth tongue and palate. other viruses including herpes can also cause blisters around the mouth. click on this link for more information about shingles.

cats and dogs are common cohabitants in the home. most people tolerate exposure to these pets without symptoms but some develop allergies to them. cat and dog allergies are triggered by an immune response to proteins in the animal's saliva urine and skin. all cats and dogs have these allergens. the best treatment is complete avoidance. when this is not possible the next best thing is to keep the pet out of the bedroom to decrease exposure to the allergen.
most helpful answer first why would anyone what to do this and second no ethical physician would risk his or her medical license to perform such a ridiculous procedure. even if it was possible. health risks? highly-likely. i know this was a serious question but i am very curious how. why. this possibility even occurred to you.

many men with benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) have no symptoms. when symptoms (known as lower urinary tract symptoms or luts) occur they may range from mild and barely noticeable to serious and disruptive. the amount of prostate enlargement is not always related to the severity of the symptoms. some men with only slight enlargement have serious symptoms and some men with a great deal of enlargement have few symptoms. your symptoms may become worse during cold weather or as a result of physical or emotional stress. some medicines can make your symptoms worse. these include over-the-counter cold medicines such as diphenhydramine hydrochloride ( benadryl for example) pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (such as sudafed ) oxymetazoline spray (such as afrin ) and prescription medicines such as antidepressants water pills (diuretics) testosterone (gels implants or injections) and pain medicines (narcotics). the symptoms of bph may involve problems emptying the bladder or problems with bladder storage. symptoms related to bladder emptying include: difficulty starting a urine stream (hesitancy and straining). decreased strength of the urine stream (weak flow). dribbling after urination. feeling that the bladder is not completely empty. an urge to urinate again soon after urinating. pain during urination (dysuria). symptoms related to bladder storage include: waking at night to urinate (nocturia). frequent urination. a sudden uncontrollable urge to urinate. these symptoms are not always related to prostate enlargement and can be caused by other conditions. bph symptoms are often balanced between the two types of symptoms. if symptoms come on rapidly or if you have more of one type of symptom than the other type you may have another condition. other conditions that may cause similar symptoms include urinary tract infections prostatitis prostate cancer diabetes heart failure and neurologic diseases. you can use the interactive tool: how bad are your urinary symptoms from bph? to evaluate how bad your symptoms are and later to judge how well your treatment is working. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

constipation is a common problem that pregnant women have. and there are some things that they can do to help ease the constipation. the first thing is to probably change their diet. i am sure it's not something that a pregnant mom wants to hear because they want to have certain foods but by increasing your fibre intake having more fruit juices fresh fruit more water. water is a great substance that can actually help you ease your constipation. a lot of times pregnant moms are dehydrated because of the fact that they are not drinking enough during the day. so by making these little changes it will help. some minimal exercise. walking around a little bit more actually does a lot of great in helping constipation. there are stool softeners that are available. the common product is docusate sodium and that can be used by pregnant women but i would definitely recommend as a pharmacist that a pregnant woman check with their ob/gyn or healthcare provider first before starting that type of therapy.
hi yes. almost all women have more vaginal discharge in pregnancy. this is quite normal and happens for a few reasons. during pregnancy the cervix (neck of the womb) and vaginal walls get softer and discharge increases to help prevent any infections travelling up from the vagina to the womb. towards the end of pregnancy the amount of discharge increases and can be confused with urine. in the last week or so of pregnancy your discharge may contain streaks of thick mucus and some blood. this is called a 'show' and happens when the mucus that has been present in your cervix during pregnancy comes away. it's a sign that the body is starting to prepare for birth and you may have a few small 'shows' in the days before you go into labour. increased discharge is a normal part of pregnancy but it's important to keep an eye on it and tell your doctor or midwife if it changes in any way. do hope this helps you. good luck
hi this is root abscess so first step you take antibiotics and anti-inflammatory and do the wait and see doing the wait and see without medical treatment is unwise you can always kill the root if pain is sever good luck
hi it seems to be a enlarged lymph node. this can be secondary to any throat ear nose or chest infection. apply local cream and anti inflammatory tablets. antibiotics should be started if there are no signs of improvement. thanks
i guess you are in the right track. with regards to food diet and exercise. restart doing your exercise. keep yourself active. try having more than three meals a day but keep the quantity of each meal less than the usual. that way you eat more frequently but without putting weight or adding unnecessary calories.
the goal of treating most cases of ordinary urticaria is to relieve symptoms while the condition goes away by itself. the most commonly used oral treatments are antihistamines which help oppose the effects of the histamine leaked by mast cells. the main side effect of antihistamines is drowsiness. many antihistamines are available without prescription such as diphenhydramine (benadryl) taken in doses of 25 milligrams and chlorpheniramine (chlor-trimeton) taken in a dose of 4 milligrams. these can be taken up to three times a day but because these medications can cause drowsiness they are often taken at bedtime. those who take them should be especially careful and be sure they are fully alert before driving or participating in other activities requiring mental concentration. loratadine (claritin 10 milligrams) is an antihistamine available over the counter that is less likely to cause drowsiness. also approved for over-the-counter use is hydroxyzine (atarax vistaril) which causes drowsiness and its breakdown product cetirizine (zyrtec 10 milligrams) which is mildly sedating. antihistamines that require a prescription include cyproheptadine (periactin) which tends to cause drowsiness. prescription antihistamines that cause little sedation are fexofenadine (allegra) and levocetirizine (xyzal). sometimes physicians combine these with other types of antihistamines called h2 blockers such as ranitidine (zantac) and cimetidine (tagamet). this antihistamine list is not exhaustive. physicians individualize treatment plans to suit specific patients and modify them depending on the clinical response. oral steroids (prednisone [medrol]) can help severe cases of hives in the short term but their usefulness is limited by the fact that many cases of hives last too long for steroid use to be continued safely. other treatments have been used for urticaria as well including montelukast (singulair) ultraviolet radiation antifungal antibiotics agents that suppress the immune system and tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline [elavil endep] nortriptyline [pamelor aventyl] doxepin [sinequan adapin]). evidence to support the benefit of such treatments is sparse. in ordinary cases they are rarely needed. topical therapies for hives are available but are generally ineffective. they include creams and lotions which help numb nerve endings and reduce itching. some ingredients which can accomplish this are camphor menthol diphenhydramine and pramoxine. many of these topical preparations require no prescription. cortisone-containing creams (steroids) even strong ones requiring a prescription are not very helpful in controlling the itch of hives.
ultimately all hernias are caused by a combination of pressure and an opening or weakness of muscle or fascia: the pressure pushes an organ or tissue through the opening or weak spot. sometimes the muscle weakness is present at birth; more often it occurs later in life. poor nutrition smoking and overexertion all can weaken muscles and make hernias more likely. anything that causes an increase in pressure in the abdomen can then cause a hernia including obesity lifting heavy objects diarrhea or constipation or persistent coughing or sneezing.
i will never understand that rationale of giving antibiotics to anyone that has a viral infection. this is not good medicine. most cases of tonillitis are viral and antibiotics are absolutely worthless and sometimes even harmful. with that said. first i assume you are a healthy adult. most adults have relatively good immune systems that fight off viral (and bacterial) exposures 24/7. while the organisms may be capable of causing disease the organism has to find a susceptible host. most of the time we just fight off those alien bugs. if you don't have tonsils you can't get tonsillitis but you can get a viral infection but it does not mean it will be identical to your son who has a different immune system. you may just get a stuffy nose or nothing at all. in your case you did get an upper respiratory infection but it didn't have to come from your son. it could have been someone else and an entired different bug. there are over 200 respiratory viruses capable of causing colds. i get exposed to strep a dozen times a week and have never got it thanks to my own immune system (and perhaps better handwashing and other precautions). trust your immune system. in most cases you will be just fine. the cold that you most likely have now will likely improve in a few days on its own.
you're body is digesting food. so blood heat and energy go to organs in charge of digestion to digest the food after you eat and retracts from the extremities so you get cold after eating.
i can understand your concern regarding your son's gastric problem after taking paxil (paroxetine) as it is a drug of ssri (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) group which is known to cause constipation in children. i suggest to prevent constipation after consulting your specialist doctor you reduce paxil dose up to a half tablet and gradually increase it up to an effective optimal dose. give high fiber diet increase water intake and encourage him for mild to moderate exercise. do not worry as these symptoms are temporary and are resolved with time. for further queries consult a psychiatrist online  
you will not experience any harm. tetracycline is safe to be taking internally  a very common and older antibiotic available in capsule form.
hi i do think it would pay you to see your doctor with these pains asap good luck
depending on your age and physical status and activity this would either be signs of lumbar disc lesion or deep venous thrombus you will need to do mri on back and dopplex on calf muscles to figure it out. redness and swelling in calf will be dvt. numbness and pain would indicate disc lesion. see a neurologist

surgery for hyperthyroidism (thyroidectomy) removes part or all of the thyroid gland. doctors rarely use this surgery to treat hyperthyroidism. you may need surgery if: your thyroid gland is so big that it is hard for you to swallow or breathe. you have thyroid cancer or your doctor suspects you have thyroid cancer. for more information see the topic thyroid cancer. you had serious side effects from taking antithyroid medicines. and radioactive iodine is not an option for you. you have a large goiter that radioactive iodine treatment did not shrink. you have a single large thyroid nodule that is making too much thyroid hormone and radioactive iodine did not effectively treat the nodule. surgery choices the only surgery for hyperthyroidism is thyroidectomy. what to think about if you are having surgery your doctor will have you take antithyroid medicines before surgery to bring your thyroid hormone levels as close to normal as possible. after surgery your doctor will check your thyroid hormone levels regularly because you may develop hypothyroidism (too little thyroid hormone). hypothyroidism is treated with thyroid hormone medicine. for more information see the topic hypothyroidism. surgery is the fastest way to treat your hyperthyroidism. but it is not used very often and is more risky and expensive than other treatments. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

hi. if you are feeling that your hands and feet are still not in control and spinning of head is a concern then you should definitely get a mri brain done and consult a neurologist. just doing blood tests will not diagnose everything. thanks
yes shingles can definitely affect the eye. this is called herpetic keratitis and can be quite serious if not diagnosed promptly and treated effectively. steroid eye drops can make herpes in the eye worse so this is usually not done unless specifically prescribed by an ophthalmologist. antibiotic eye drops would have no beneficial effect on herpes involving the eye so special anti-viral/anti-herpetic drops are used. having chicken pox as a child is really a prerequisite to getting shingles; in the eye or other places. the chicken pox virus is also a herpes virus that has reactivated from a second exposure. i am pleased that her eye cultures came back negative.
there tons of studies about diabetes and how it effects the brain but first and i am probably preaching to the choir here but lets see your son start taking care of himself. i can understand that he might also be despondent and might even be depressed about his diabetes but there are lots of ways to live happily with it. back to the question at hand i read that diabetes if in check and maintain does not have any adverse affects to the brain but if out of check and when glocuse levels are high for an extended period of time some research shows that it could lead to memory lost brain shrinkage increase stroke probaility and we will be more prone to cognitive decline alzheimer's; but even high sugar levels in non-diabetes can cause these issues but because we diabetics have a hard time controlling blood sugar it is more critical for us.
the onset of portal hypertension may not always be associated with specific symptoms that identify what is happening in the liver. but if you have liver disease that leads to cirrhosis the chance of developing portal hypertension is high. the main symptoms and complications of portal hypertension include: gastrointestinal bleeding: black tarry stools or blood in the stools; or vomiting of blood due to the spontaneous rupture and hemorrhage from varices. ascites (an accumulation of fluid in the abdomen). encephalopathy or confusion and forgetfulness caused by poor liver function. reduced levels of platelets blood cells that help form blood clots or white blood cells the cells that fight infection.
this surgery can limit your ulnar and radial deviation movements but should not hinder flexion extension rotations of the wrist. what i really recommend is going with a physiotherapy rehabilitation program using paraffin wax and ultra sound treatments exercises to strength your wrist muscle and improve the range if motion for at least 12 sessions in a month. i have seen a case like yours recently and it responded very well to this program and pain decreased in 5 sessions to 30% and after 12 sessions the patient was able to practice handy crafts (his own job). feel better soon.
i'm 39 and have been taking adderrall dr 30 mg for more than 5 years now. i take mine after breakfast in the morning. i have never had issues when i exercise but every person reacts to medications differently. make sure you have food in your body and take as prescribed. your dr. or local pharmacist should be able to tell you if you are worried. when you fill you script you get a print out of information about that medication and what to expect if you have allergic reaction medication interactions food interactions etc. if your exercising maybe just every few minutes ou could check your heart rate. if rises to fast then you know its time to rest and you will know your limits. you may just need to let your body adjust to medication also for a few weeks.
it depends on what is causing the pimples. if you are a teen some of that is normal because of hormones. you can use a salycilic acid wash or the kind of pads you use to wipe your face. make sure you use soap products that don't have added fragrence shower frequently and don't let sweat build up. this should help.
if you have gained full range of motion and muscle power with physiotherapy and you are back to playing sports and feeling some pain while playing you can wear a normal elbow support to prevent sudden rotations and overloads that may cause strain or tendinitis. do not forget that always treating the cause ( muscle weakness ) is the first line of treatment  thanks
a skilled phlebotomist can find a vein by just feeling (palpating) it. a visual view is not necessary. apply a warm compress and allowing the arm to hang down prior to the blood draw would be helpful and ask for a phlebotomist that is skilled drawing blood from children! they are used to those tiny hard-to-find veins.
a description of your symptoms may be all a doctor requires to diagnose heartburn but sometimes additional testing may be necessary. the esophagus can be viewed through an endoscope a long thin flexible tube inserted through the mouth or by x-ray. sometimes your doctor may recommend a 24-hour esophageal ph probe study especially if you have unusual symptoms such as throat or chest or abdominal pain; coughing; or asthma-like symptoms. in this test a long narrow flexible tube is inserted through the nose down into the esophagus and a probe is left there for 24 hours. this probe detects acid levels to determine if it correlates with your symptoms. a newer technique (called bravo) measures 24-hour acid; it is done using wireless ph sensors which eliminates the need for a tube insertion. to detect if your heart is the cause of your symptoms an electrocardiogram a recording of the heart's electrical activity may be taken.
yes you can get just the sensitivity. i've had the all the symptoms to the extreme of being temporarily paralyzed. had all the tests done. started getting them when i was 15. that was 32 years ago and they have changed over the years. i do get many silent migraines.
over-the-counter antihistamines are safe to take if you use lexapro. but i suggest you use one that does not cause drowsiness. antihistamines can cause drowsiness which can be more pronounced in someone taking a medication like lexapro. always ask your pharmacist before using an over-the-counter medication to ensure it is safe for you. i take lexapro. what allergy medicine can i take
hey dont worry. you will just need some hot drinks like (chamomile tea & ginger root tea). hot pack very warm will relax muscles and relieving you of dreadful discomfort. walk listen relaxing music and some yoga will really help.
the affordable care act does allow insurance companies to sell across state lines through interstate compacts which means states have to agree to the sale of insurance by out-of-state companies. and in fact state exchanges may encourage more insurance companies to enter new markets thereby increasing competition and choice beyond what republicans claim will be the case under their proposal.

"i commend you for wanting to lose weight presumably for better health. making that decision is an important step in achieving results. you will find all kinds of fad diets pills and concoctions that supposedly will help you lose weight but the basic principle of weight loss never changes: calories in must be less than calories out. the best way to lose weight is to adopt an overall healthy lifestyle. this includes eating nutritious meals that consist of fresh fruit and vegetables lean proteins whole grains and healthy fats like olive oil. but you also should exercise regularly. daily walking is an easy free way to get started. (be sure to get your doctor's permission before starting any exercise program. ) going back to ""calories in versus calories out "" you need not starve yourself. you can either choose to eat less food to decrease your calorie intake or you can choose to exercise more to increase your calories burned. either approach will work. you'll find a lot of good advice in webmd's weight loss and diet plans center. the road to weight loss and a healthy lifestyle can be slow and filled with setbacks. don't get discouraged! remember this is a lifelong journey. you've already taken the most important first step! wishing you all the best."
being overweight does not necessarily mean that a person over eats. sometimes this is congenital and due to her hormonal structure she tends to be fat and overweight. she can lose a lot of weight through exercises at this age thanks
the answer will always be the same: ice for the first 3 days then ice and heat (switching) for about a week. if the pain doesn't go down see a doctor. it might feel nice to keep your arm in one position but make sure that you keep up mobility so that you don't lose any. i am not a doctor nor do i play one on tv but i'm getting pretty good at studying medicine
high-end window question doctors. com facial palsy cases usually treated with corticosteroids hand physical therapy modalities but if injury persists then you need to check for being upper motor neuron lesion not a cranial nerve palsy. if it is proven yo be lower motor neuron lesion then you need to try lymphatic massage for the neck and behind ear lobe are plus ultra sound and laser treatments.
"the exact cause of irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) isn't known but stress and anxiety are believed to be factors. it's important to note ibs is a long-term disorder. it is not something that ""comes and goes. "" usually a person who has symptoms of ibs has them regularly for many years. on the other hand stress and anxiety can cause temporary upsets of the digestive tract too. this is not ibs per se because the episodes go away. stress and anxiety can cause: stomach upset nausea diarrhea among other things. it's also important to note colonoscopy and endoscopy tests are not used to diagnose ibs. these tests may be given to rule out more serious bowel problems like crohn's disease. so the fact your colonoscopy and endoscopy results were ""fine"" does not mean you don't have ibs. you should talk to your primary care provider to find out what your diagnosis is  if you have a diagnosis at all. wishing you well!"
your symptoms are likely gastroenteritis your shoulder and flank pain and early period(if happened once) would be due to anxiety i recommend doing yoga and breathing exercises. eating probiotics and get a stool analysis. a gi doctor can help you if symptoms persisted after all.
sometimes the scale doesnt accurately reflect whats really happening with your body. keep in mind that your weight can fluctuate naturally throughout the course of a day. consider if youve eaten used the restroom or how well hydrated you are; all of which have a physical weight to them that can influence the number on the scale. seeing a change like loss of inches can be a great indicator of progress. see if you notice a more toned appearance or more muscle definition as well. also check to see if your clothes fit differently such as by dropping pants sizes having to take a belt in more notches or shirts being loose or not as tight. these changes in body composition can be viewed as more favorable than actual weight loss recorded on a scale. i wholly encourage you to not just view your progress through solely what the scale shows alone. if you do weigh yourself however it may be best to limit yourself to once per week just so that you can notice any weight loss trends but not enough to where youre obsessing over the numbers. keep the timing of when you weigh yourself the same to establish consistency probably first thing in the morning to help take away confounding variables.
it is my opinion that in your case surgery is the best option.
depending on your job it may be difficult to keep your hands moist throughout the day. generally it's best to moisturize after each hand washing while the hands are still a little wet. try switching from a hand lotion to a cream that is rich in ceramides. these sophisticated ingredients work better to help restore the skins barrier. also make sure that the soap you're using is not too drying. some of the more harsh antibacterial soaps can actually strip the skin of its natural oils.
"heart failure is caused by many conditions that damage the heart muscle including: coronary artery disease: cad a disease of the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart causes decreased blood flow to the heart muscle. if the arteries become blocked the heart becomes starved for oxygen and nutrients. this condition along with heart attack is responsible for two thirds of heart failure cases in the u. s. heart attack: a heart attack may occur when a coronary artery becomes suddenly blocked stopping the flow of blood to the heart muscle and damaging it. all or part of the heart muscle becomes cut off from its supply of oxygen. a heart attack can damage the heart muscle resulting in a scarred area that does not function properly. ""non-ischemic"" cardiomyopathy: this condition occurs when there is damage to the heart muscle from causes other than artery or blood flow problems such as from infections or alcohol or drug abuse. conditions that overwork the heart: high blood pressure (hypertension) valve disease thyroid disease kidney disease diabetes or heart defects present at birth can all cause heart failure (some of these are non-ischemic cardiomyopathy  see above). in addition heart failure can occur when several diseases or conditions are present at once."
it does not seem to be due to allergy. it may be due to hormonal changes in her body. she can take vitamin tablets apply local creams.

the proper dose of ibuprofen for your son based on his age and weight is 200 mg. therefore it would be fine to give him one 200 mg tablet every six to eight hours as needed for his fever.
surgery to remove the cancer is the most common treatment for penile cancer. a doctor may take out the cancer using one of the following operations: wide local excision takes out only the cancer and some normal tissue on either side. electrodessication and curettage removes the cancer by scraping the tumor with a curette (thin long instrument with a scraping edge) and applying an electric current to the area to kill cancer cells. cryosurgery uses liquid nitrogen to freeze and kill the cancer cells. microsurgery (moh's surgery) is an operation that removes the cancer and as little normal tissue as possible. during this surgery the doctor uses a microscope to look at the cancerous area to make sure all the cancer cells are removed. laser surgery uses a narrow beam of light to remove cancer cells. circumcision is an operation that removes the foreskin. amputation of the penis (penectomy) is an operation that removes the penis. it is the most common and most effective treatment of cancer of the penis. in a partial penectomy part of the penis is removed. in a total penectomy the whole penis is removed. lymph nodes in the groin may be taken out during surgery. radiation which uses high-energy rays to attack cancer and chemotherapy which uses drugs to kill cancer are other treatment options.
a tiny piece of electrical tape in your rectal area should not pose a significant health risk and should eventually come out with stooling. these things do not happen accidentally as you know so please be very very careful when inserting any objects in your rectum.
"hello, as you explain the situation, unfortunately, there is no home treatment for pneumonia. i strongly recommend you to go to the hospital as an emergency which is free mostly. hope i have answered your query. let me know if i can assist you further. regards, dr. jnikolla, pulmonologist"
postpartum depression has received more attention in recent years. but most of it has focused on moms. a new study published in jama found some interesting results: about 10% of dads suffer from postpartum depression too. yes 1 in 10 dads become seriously depressed between their partners first trimester and in the first year (usually the first three to six months) of their childs life. and men are more likely to be depressed when their partners are depressed. as you might imagine its difficult to provide a nurturing environment for a baby when both parents are feeling down. this is a real issue for new parents to be aware of.

food allergy symptoms include skin gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms. skin symptoms include hives or an itchy red rash; respiratory symptoms include coughing wheezing and laryngoedema (a swollen throat); and the gastrointestinal symptoms include significant vomiting intestinal pain and diarrhea. these symptoms are always temporally related to ingestion  that means very close in time. often it's seconds to minutes after ingestion but always within hours. if you drink milk today and have symptoms tomorrow it's not related.
there are no particular germs (viruses) that just cause bronchitis so being exposed does not necessarily mean you will catch the same identical disease. just about any of the 200 or so respiratory viruses can cause bronchitis in a person who is susceptible to that particular virus. to be safe stand away from her coughing or sneezing.
"i don't know. i suspect that question is best addressed to the plastic surgeon or his nursing staff. just give them a call. i can tell you that he will not ""freeze the pin"" but may provide you will another type of local anesthesia if he feels it is necessary."
a hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the uterus. the cervix is just the opening to the uterus so i do not know the extent of this person's surgery or cancer. a uterus is required in order to bear children.
in my opinion surgery is the treatment of choice now after all these medications for years but it needs regular close follow up.
salmon is on many a restaurant menu these days at least in california. from salmon sandwiches or burgers to various renditions of grilled salmon â€” you are more likely to find salmon on the menu at casual cafes or elegant restaurants than ever before. at many of the restaurants i visited recently in southern california there was at least one additional salmon option added to the menu â€” like the salmon fillet sandwich from the la food show restaurant in manhattan beach. this sandwich was simple yet delicious featuring grilled salmon with cilantro aioli and fresh tomato and lettuce on a brioche bun. there were several other salmon entrees offered at this restaurant as well. i also noticed salmon as one of the protein options for some of the entrÃ©e salads at various restaurants. thats when i realized salmon had arrived as an official food trend. i love the food trends that are actually good for you! most of us now know that when we eat fish particularly fish higher in fat we are getting the health-promoting fish omega-3s which may help decrease blood clotting decrease abnormal heart rhythms reduce triglycerides and promote normal blood pressure. omega-3s appear to have anti-inflammatory action within body tissues and some researchers suggest getting more omega-3s to reduce the risk of inflammatory diseases. a 4-ounce serving of steamed or broiled salmon contains approximately:  233 calories.  25 grams protein.  13 grams fat.  2. 8 grams saturated fat.  5 grams monounsaturated fat.  5 grams polyunsaturated fat.  2. 5 grams omega-3 fatty acids.
states may vary in what specific forms of information they will want you to have when you apply for a premium subsidy to help pay for a health plan sold in the marketplace â€“ details have not yet been released (mid-july 2013). but in general you will need something to prove your income â€“ such as a paystub or wage statement or your last years income tax filing. if you are self-employed or are paid in cash you may be asked to show a bank statement or a set of recurring bills for rent and utilities to back up your estimate of how much you earn. your statement of how much your income is will be checked against tax and social security records. if you under-estimate your income by a lot at the end of the year you will be required to pay back the extra subsidy amount you should not have received. you also will need your social security number and drivers license or some form of identification that shows you are a legal resident of your state.
"ask your gynecologist what could be causing your cycle to go awry. maybe it is related to having your iud taken out. or it could be hormonal. as you are trying to become pregnant are you taking any hormones? either way keep a ""menstrual journal"": a written record of how many days you bleed and how heavily it flows (and how much pain or other related symptoms you feel) on each of the days. show this record to your gyno after about 2 months. in the meantime be sure your gynecologist he or she is aware that you are having this bleeding problem. if there is pain either while you are bleeding or in that region any other time including during intercourse be sure to tell her/him that too. write it down as well on the menstrual journal. the idea is to determine a pattern. if your system becomes more stable and your periods become more regularly spaced and less heavy and severe as time passes that will be good because it should indicate that your hormones simply needed to adjust and are becoming normalized. but if this does not happen; if you keep right on having either very long periods or very heavy periods or more than one period a month or any combination of those things you will need to have your gyno do a complete examination and look over your menstrual journal; this will be crucially important because you will need to rule out any serious health issues that might have either started showing up because they had been hidden by the iud or have just developed right now. you may have endometriosis which is a condition that can be disguised by iuds or by taking birth control medications. you'll need to rule out anything like uterine or ovarian cancer which are unlikely but can sometimes happen. and you need to be sure you do not have hpv or other health conditions which can be catching. and you need to be certain the iud did not accidentally cause inflammation or injury either while it was in or while it was being removed. hope you are well soon; and good luck in becoming pregnant! if all goes well before long you will have a healthy baby! first get yourself in good health. it is do-able. be certain to tell not only your gynecologist but your primary care physician as well. and be sure both doctors know all medications and over-the-counter remedies including herbal ones you may be taking. these will have an influence on things as well. better health to you!"
"reward ""good language"" with open praise and a hug or even a coin for his piggy bank. this may be the attention he is desiring. discourage swearing (he is doing this just for attention) by ignoring it reminding him that swearing is bad behavior and good boys like him do not swear. behavioral changes can take time so hold off on washing his mouth out with soap."
you can clean it for re-use because it's made of silicone which is generally non porous. maybe soak it in some rubbing alcohol use something thin like a pipe cleaner to clean out the hole wash it well let it dry thoroughly and you should be good. it wouldn't be the same story if it were porous then you might have a harder time cleaning it.
the risk totally depends upon your lifestyle and your thromboembolic predisposition family history etc. better to continue with the anti coagulants
most of the time white spots are not a problem. but 1 year of age is the perfect time to see the dentist for the first time! my daughter is now 9. she has 2 white spots on her teeth. i inquired with the dentist about this and she said that studies show the white spots were created if they ever had a high temp fever? or if the mother had a fever while pregnant? let me know if you've heard any other answers!
this could indicate blood somewhere in your genitourinary tract so it would be best to see your medical provider so that the source can be determined.
"lung cancer can metastasize (spread to other organs). many times we will find a tumor or mass on one organ but will need to look in other organs to find the ""primary"" (first) tumor. the one that started it all. the doctor may be investigating the liver as a metastatic site from lung cancer but you would need to address this question directly to the doctor."
you do not need to wait if you definitely have a urinary tract infection. antibiotics can be given as soon as the infection is properly diagnosed.

if you're living outside the country for the majority of the year you are not required to buy health insurance under the affordable care act. if you visit a physician while here for a visit without health insurance you'll need to pay out-of-pocket for the services you receive.
in your own chlorinated pool? yes assuming the wound is not draining or oozing. you can always cover small area of staph with a water-proof bandaid but in most cases he will not contaminate a large pool or put others at risk.
"the first thing that came to my mind is ""how long has this been going on for? "" anytime i hear that children have been vomiting for some time or is starting to dry heave my first words are ""call the pediatrician and go to the er""the child is probably severely dehydrated and probably needs iv fluids. you should not give her pepto-bismol because it is not for vomiting and since this may be a virus you should not use pepto-bismol liquid because one of the ingredients is related to aspirin and is associated with reye's syndrome. pepto-bismol actually has a childrens formulation that contains calcium carbonate instead which is safe to use."
"behavioral activation is a goal of cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) that aims to help people engage more often in enjoyable activities and improve their problem-solving skills. in cbt, the therapist helps you schedule enjoyable experiences, often with other people in your life. part of the process is deciding how to get past any obstacles that stand in the way of enjoyment."

"obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) is a chronic or long-term illness and without treatment symptoms typically come and go over time and may significantly interfere with your ability to work and have a family. treatment can reduce the severity of the illness. and although some symptoms may linger after treatment you should be able to have an active social life raise a family and work. anxiety is the most prominent symptom of ocd. for example you may have an overall sense that something terrible will happen if you don't follow through with a particular ritual such as repeatedly checking to see whether the stove is on. if you don't perform the ritual you may have immediate anxiety or a nagging sense of incompleteness. symptoms of ocd vary with each person and include the following: 2 3 obsessive thoughts fear of dirt or germs or overconcern about body smells/secretions or the proper functioning of the body overconcern with order neatness and exactness fear of thinking bad thoughts or doing something embarrassing constantly thinking of certain sounds words or numbers or a preoccupation with counting or checking constant need for approval or the need to apologize fear that something terrible will happen or fear of harming yourself or someone else compulsive behaviors frequently washing hands showering or brushing teeth or the overuse of items to hide body smells constantly cleaning straightening and ordering certain objects repeatedly checking zippers and buttons on clothing checking lights appliances or doors again and again to be sure they are turned off or closed repeating certain physical activities such as sitting down and getting up from a chair hoarding objects such as newspapers asking the same question or saying the same thing over and over avoiding public places or taking extreme measures to prevent harm to yourself or others religious rituals such as constant silent praying it is common for children with ocd to need to repeat actions until they feel ""just right "" such as going back and forth through a door going up and down stairs touching things with their right hand and then their left (symmetrical touch) or rereading or rewriting school assignments. 4 children with ocd may not want to go to school or may be afraid to leave someone they trust. you may experience suicidal feelings if you have depression along with ocd. warning signs of suicide include talking about death or giving away possessions. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

"i would not be able to blindly address your question as to ""what it is"" since i cannot see these sores  a vague description is just not sufficient. i suggest that you see a medical provider or a dermatologist  someone who can physically examine you  in order to get a proper diagnosis and treatment. i have an appointment with a dermatologist on the 29th. my general physician didn't know after examining me just said not cancer not impetigo."
your not alone in this world. your story is kind of similar to mine. i had been bullied verbally. even after changing schools people would treat me the same. they would whisper or talk behind my back look at me and make fun of me. the pain is unbearable huh? not only the bullying at school started my anxiety disorder but it also came from my home nothing physical just verbally and emotionally i was hurt. as soon as i started college i began to take therapy if figured i had nothing else to lose you know? what else could happen to me? i've been feeling pain throughout my life i'm use to it. i couldn't trust anyone throughout my childhood. however i felt tired suffocated and sad being alone and afraid so i decided to change. no matter how much pain i felt i didn't want to feel depress any more and if i wanted to become free from my past and i guess my family i needed to built my strength. thanks to therapy i was able to deal with my anxiety and meet someone else could see understand me hear me out without judging my every word. i was someone who was damaged but i was fixed little by little. although to be honest it still kinda of hurts thinking about those days.

the first signs of pregnancy can start within the first few weeks it is different for every woman allot of woman don't even realise that they can be pregnant until the morning sickness starts.
to answer your question i really would need to know more specific information about which medications you are referring to. in general people with hypothyroidism and high blood pressure are advised to avoid decongestant medications that contain phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine because these medications can raise blood pressure and cause a rapid heartbeat in some patients. ask your pharmacist which cold medicine would be right for your specific symptoms and with your current medications.

once a fatty liver shows up by imaging studies - such as a sonongram it means that at least 30% of your liver is laden with fat. this is very unhealthy for your liver and impacts your likelihood of curing hcv with antiviral treatment. . in addition to a healthy weight-loss diet and exercise program studies have demonstrated that the following vitamins may be helpful in treating fatty livers - vitamin e betaine vitamin c vitamin d. of course prior to starting any new diet/vitamins/and exercise you must check with your personal physician as he/she knows the details of your history best. . i actually researched and published on this issue over 2 decades ago  and found that losing 10% of your current body weight will significantly impact the amount of fat on your liver. . liver is getting to much or to less of something i was diagnosed with fatty liver in about 2005 from my primary care doctor. at the time i liked to drink a few beers with the boys and he said i needed to stop my drinking. well i started to research on the topic. much of what i read pointed toward and my doctor agreed that weight loss was the main issue. so i told him i wanted to look at getting weight loss surgery. him and i disagree here because he thought i just needed to totally quit drinking and i thought lets try weight loss surgery and possibly supplements to help. while we still disagreed some he made me appointment with a weight loss center in spokane wa. to this day that was the best decision i have made. ever since then my ability to help my own liver numbers have been much easier. i have been using milk thistle along with weight loss ever since and am doing very good even today with good blood work ups and so forth. my doctor though is still negative on what i did. oh well its 2015. liver numbers still good! i still drink some and take milk thistle. i believe diet would help when there are fat deposits from alcoholism or obesity

hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm) is an inherited cardiac condition which affects approximately 1 in 500 people. it results in abnormal thickening of the heart muscle and increases the risk of symptoms like shortness of breath and dizziness as well as potentially lethal cardiac arrhythmias. hcm is the number one cause of sudden death in young athletes.
well the downside to these products is that there are side effects. for example men that have certain high blood pressure disorders are taking nitrate medications. if you mix these oral erection drugs with that you can drop your blood pressure and have a serious complication. this is why men who take viagra levitra and cialis if after having sex they have a heart attack they have to tell the paramedics and er doctors they have this product in their systems. because one of the first things the doctors will want to do is put nitrates into their blood to stabilize their heart and their blood pressure. the combination can be deadly. there can be some visual disorders. one of the big side effects is that the drug really isnt being used correctly for many men. theyre either not being given enough trials with it it sometimes takes several doses before its effective they try it once and they say its not going to work and theyll go try something else. the other thing is its become very recreational. a lot of guys who dont need it are taking it which raises some concerns. why? because its almost become the thing to do. you know you take the drug and youre guaranteed a good erection. well if you had good erections before it probably wont help but its just kind of a macho kind of a way of just kind of having fun. the other concern is that for most men that have true erectile dysfunction thats a symptom of something far more serious whether its diabetes hormone problems metabolic problems vascular disorders. thats an early warning sign. and by simply throwing viagra levitra cialis at them and not addressing the cause im really doing them a lot of disservice. if its truly the first warning sign of potential coronary artery disease i mean if its the first warning sign of coronary artery disease and you dont do the right workup the guy may get great erections but he may have a heart attack in a year or two that could have been prevented. its essential that you understand why it is you have erectile dysfunction. some men just get it and thats the way that you are. but you want to make sure that theres nothing serious that youre missing.

"it definitely depends on your approach to weight loss. what foods did you eat and did you exercise also? exercise which increases the heart rate for about 20 min. a few times a week will help to reduce cholesterol glucose and bp. also if you've been eating processed foods (i. e. weight-watchers prepared meals) you might want to check the sodium content nitrates and other chemicals all known for that ominous jump in blood pressure we all dread. i'd be willing to bet that the meals especially without exercise (as with any other change in diet only to lose weight) are at least playing a part in the blood pressure increases especially since this is a common complaint among ""dieters"". my suggestion would be to stop ""dieting"" and to make small healthy life-style changes such as eating more fruits and veggies especially fresh lots of green leafy foods - fresh spinach is excellent. make sure that you cut back on processed foods simple carbohydrates (donuts cake candy) as these just feed any sugar addiction you may have (very bad for you) eat high protein foods healthy fats (omega3 from avocados olive and coconut oils). also eat small (healthy) snacks between meals and drink lots of water. this will keep you from overeating at meal time keeps your metabolism going which helps to burn more fat and helps you to lose weight (fat cells) the right way lowering risk of any negative side effects which come with many diets/fads. i was diagnosed with type ii diabetes about 6 1/2 years ago and these are the things which i had to learn to get rid of the excess fat i had put on after ending up physically disabled for many years and less active. they work my a1c is down to normal levels and i do not take the meds any longer. i know it works and any exercise you can add to your food regimen will help you too. i wish you great success and hope that this helps."
(please clear any kind of exercise program with your physician and fitness professional especially if you have any physical disability or restrictions. ) 1. squats: squats are your mainstay for building and strengthening your buns. stand with feet hip-width apart and hold weights at shoulder level or at your sides. bend the knees and lower into a squat keeping the knees behind the toes. imagine that youre sticking your butt out behind you but keep the torso upright and contracted. press into the heels to stand up. repeat for 2-3 sets of 8-16 reps. 2. wall sit: stand about 2 feet in front of a wall and lean against it. slide down until your knees are at about 90-degree angles and hold keeping the abs contracted for 20-60 seconds. come back to start and repeat holding the squat at different angles to work the lower body in different ways. to add intensity hold weights or squeeze a ball between the knees. 3. leg press: here youll be pushing a weight or resistance away from yourself using your legs. this can be done with gym equipment or bands. 4. lunges: these exercises come in a variety of forms. the traditional lunge goes forward with weights and a bent knee or there is the assisted lunge with no weight and you can hold onto a wall or chair. or you can try a lunge that requires a much smaller range of motion lowering your body only part way. 5. dead lift: this exercise is not meant for everyone. it targets the lower back glutes and hamstrings. if you have any problems with these muscles dont do a dead lift. this exercise simulates what we do all day long as we bend over and pick things up. 6. hip extension: this is one of my favorite exercises to strengthen the glutes. stand facing a wall placing both palms on the wall and with a straight back simply push one leg out behind you as high as you can go keeping the back and leg straight. do this 10 times switching legs each time. or you can get on the floor on all fours and take one leg and simply stretch it straight behind you. do this 10 times switching legs each time. if you use ankle weights you can add more intensity for a real glute challenge.

"a fall like the one you describe definitely can cause muscle stiffness and soreness throughout the entire body. in fact a fall like that can cause painful back spasms in particular. you should see a doctor if: symptoms get worse after 3 days or so you begin to have difficulty breathing or shortness of breath you begin to run a fever you experience numbness shock-like pains or a ""running water"" sensation in your arms or hands you have difficulty urinating otherwise you probably are safe to take a wait-and-see approach to this. muscle spasms and soreness may resolve on their own or they may require medical intervention. only time will tell. feel better soon!"
i really want to answer this bizarre question but struggle with trying to take your question seriously. first you did not cause brain damage from expelling gas unless the force of the fart launched you forward or into the air at great speed (see this what i struggle with! ). a sudden movement of the head or neck can cause a brief spasm of the neck muscles so i suspect this is what happened to you. i trust you have fully recovered and that there are no unintentional collateral damage to your physical surroundings.
this depends on a few things. if you exercise first thing in the morning or late in the afternoon you could quickly follow up with a healthy breakfast or dinner. if your workout is during non-meal time it's best to have something to replenish your muscle carbohydrate stores (called glycogen) with a little bit of protein for muscle repair and synthesis. research shows that eating foods with a combination of carbohydrates and protein is best (4:1 ratio) for recovery. here are some examples: whole wheat toast with peanut butter fruit with nuts and seeds (trail mix) apple with nut butter fruit smoothie with added protein yogurt topped with nuts chocolate milk (research has shown this to be a great recovery drink) granola/protein bar with the right combination of carb and protein for more on what to eat before during and after exercise see this webmd article. i have a protein shake which relieves me of that felling of being hungry. protein! most protein shakes are specifically formulated for post workout fuel and also contain other useful ingredients for your muscles and recovery. if you want food cottage cheese tuna oatmeal peanut butter are good examples. you do need to eat before two hours. it is good unless it's liquid item then 1hr is sufficient. as for the hunger after exercising out you will always get hunger after even if you ate before. you burn a lot of calories when you workout and your body wants more. it's fine to eat after you workout. that's one of the few times that carbs are okay. after i workout i drink a carb drink that's 400 calories and 100 carbs. and then i drink my protein shake after that.

cognitive restructuring is the process in cognitive behavioral therapy of finding and changing inaccurate negative thoughts that can lead to depression.
usually your doctor would put you on a regimen of androgen blockers and hormone supplements. androgen blockers don't have to be extreme in fact there is a common blood pressure pill that works for that. but that's what they'd probably do. they might choose to supplement your estrogen progesterone and possibly other things. and they'd monitor your blood to make sure you were becoming fertile and had the right levels. they would probably also monitor you throughout pregnancy to make sure you carried the child to term. so the therapy wouldn't be hard to do but you'd need a good doctor's help - either an endocrinologist or an ob/gyn. also a lot would depend on why your hormone balance is off in the first place. if it's due to polycystic ovarian syndrome that would require treatment too.
of course having low haemoglobin count can cause these feeling of breathlessness. as a result under stressful conditions you can get such episodes. as your oxygen is not sufficient so your respiratory rate will increase to cope with low oxygen level in blood. and this in turn will lead to frequent fatiguability and weakness. your haemtologist should write you a haematinic supplement as well treating thalassemia.

hi these are some links for natural ways out of anxiety.   there is a great thing called meditation you find it helps to focus.   just copy one at a time into google to the www. to open and read. lots of help just read through them pick which you think will be best for you but do think hard about meditation works for lots of people. just how long have you been having these vaginal problems you have not put you age but have you thought menopause? and not forgetting it can come at any time. all it would take is a blood test you doctor would know from your hormones if that is the fact. some things to think about how often do you have sex or are you to dry for that? are you shaved? to save you from this heat problem have you thought of going commando when ever you can as long as you wear long skirts it would be ok but cant see how the vaginal problem are related to anxiety till i had a read through this.  as above just copy. may help you. hope something here dose some good. good luck
eczema is a general term for many types of skin inflammation (dermatitis). the most common form of eczema is atopic dermatitis (sometimes these two terms are used interchangeably). however there are many different forms of eczema. eczema can affect people of any age although the condition is most common in infants and about 85% of those affected have an onset prior to 5 years of age. eczema will permanently resolve by age 3 in about half of affected infants. in others the condition tends to recur throughout life. people with eczema often have a family history of the condition or a family history of other allergic conditions such as asthma or hay fever. the nature of the link between these conditions is inadequately understood. up to 20% of children and 1%-2% of adults are believed to have eczema. eczema is slightly more common in girls than in boys. it occurs in people of all races. eczema is not contagious but since it is believed to be at least partially inherited it is not uncommon to find members of the same family affected.

the easy answer - none. not only have cold medicines been found to be ineffective they have the potential to make things worse. over-dosages of potent decongestants antihistamines and cough medications were common so the new recommendation is to withhold giving any medications to a child under the age of 6 years. of course cold symptoms can be treated with non-medicines. a stuffy congested nose can be miserable. parents can liquefy this mucous (medical term for snot) by saline nasal sprays or drops maintaining adequate hydration and by using a cool mist humidifier. less-viscous snot is easier for the baby to naturally swallow than velcro-like sticky snot.

i cannot find any research to show that low carbohydrate diets increase potassium levels. in fact low carbohydrate diets tend to be low in potassium since it is found in plant foods including potatoes fruits and vegetables. for more on source of potassium see this article. but potassium is also an electrolyte that can increase or decrease due to medical problems such as kidney and heart failure that aren't necessarily related to dietary intake. for the person with kidney damage (called renal failure) not yet on dialysis high protein is not recommended. if you are concerned about your potassium levels see your healthcare provider to see if something else is going on.

i have suffered from hives for the last 20 years but have had a case of chronic hives for the last 2 years but the mdication that i was using prednesone and atarax no longer had any effect on this condition. i cosulted dr joel katz in th las vegas area an immunologist and he prescribed doxepin in 25 mg doses to be increased one additional dose at a time untill the hives receeded and at the level of 100 mg it has been effective. the good doctor also informed me that if this medication did not work that cyclosporin or dapsone would be considered as options. for all who suffer from this condition ther are options but you must seek the advise of an immunologist.

most helpful answer stress can make any illness or condition seem worse but stress is not a direct cause of acne. acne is basically caused by hormones that result in oily skin clogged pores and a proliferation of acne-causing bacteria. rod moser pa phd if acne caused by hormones then how one can balance them to stop causing acne. as one of my friend is suffering form a severe acne. she is using betnovate to cure pimple at night. and after curing pimple within 2-3 days she used retino-a. but within 2-3 days she got a new pimple on her face and she apply the same for that too. she become frustrate by this unending process and want to get rid of it. i thought she is having very much stress that's why she is having such severe acne problem. but as per your concern this is caused by hormones so please recommend something batter for her asap.
i would say talk to your pharmacist and also let your doctor or healthcare provider know if you are having a problem paying for your medicines. there are a variety of different things and options that aren't available. there are prescription assistance programs that are offered to pharmaceutical manufacturers. the doctor maybe able to provide you some free samples. there are also some coupon programs where you maybe able to get a 7 or 14-day trial of the pharmacy to try. generic opportunities if the product is available generically that could be another option. i think a lot of people don't realize too by talking to their doctor and letting them know upfront that they're struggling with paying their medications maybe that means when they start a new medication they don't write for hundred pills right away. they have you write out for 30 pills and maybe you try it first to see how you're doing. so many times i have patients who come into the pharmacy and they say well this didn't work and i spent $200. and i'm like yeah he should have just written four months to try not three months right off the bat. everyone thinks well if i buy more it's cheaper in the long run. that's great when you are on something consistent for a long period of time but if it's something new maybe that's something to actually save cost in the long run because if it doesn't work then you did waste the money on that particular product and got switched to something else. always talk to your pharmacist with the medication experts we're here to help you i love talking to patients it's the best part of my day.
yes intervals work indoors or out. your body won't know the difference between running sprints on a track or the treadmill cycling on the road or on a stationary bike (indoor cycling classes are great interval workouts) or working on an elliptical or any other exercise machine. you can do intervals with swimming rowing cross-country skiing or any other sport you like. intervals work as long as you get your heart rate pumping and follow the ratios.
i'm not a dr but have you gone to one to see if there is a medical reason to explain this? my friends daughter is 13 and weighs 230 pounds. i was keeping her for awhile and decided to help her lose some of the weight. the first thing i did was not allow her to make her own plate. she thought she knew about portion sizes but really she was putting way too much food on her plate. a sample breakfast could be a scrambled egg with some spinach a meat for protein (1 sausage) and a glass of orange juice. or since you're young you might only have cereal for an option so pick a cereal that's healthy and without all that sugar. an ex could be kashi or something like raisin bran. the second thing i did was teach her about nutrition. her mom is 300+ pounds so i knew there was no one there who knew either. if you ball your hand into a fist that's the size of your stomach. that's how much food can actually fit. anymore than that then you're stretching your stomach out. the more you cut back on eating the more your stomach goes back to the size it's supposed to be. third which should probably be first but i wanted to get her eating habits down first is exercise exercise exercise. you have to exercise. skipping at school or pe isn't enough. i walked with her everyday for 30 minutes. she didn't think she could do it but i stood by her every step of the way and encouraged her. we were even able to start doing it twice a day. hopefully at some point we can speed walk then start jogging. fourth you have to drink tons of water. sometimes your body might feel like it's hungry when you're actually thirsty. a good rule of thumb is to start off with64 ounces a day. to help you measure use a plastic water bottle to fill your cups/glasses and that's how you can keep track. fifth which should probably be higher is to make sure you eat enough healthy foods. i made her eat 2 servings of vegetables with every meal. her snacks were fruit. also a good time to say eat 5-7 small meals everyday and when i say small i mean the size of your fist small.
osteoporosis is rare among children and adolescents. when it occurs it is usually caused by an underlying medical disorder or by medications used to treat such disorders. this is called secondary osteoporosis. it may also be the result of a genetic disorder such as osteogenesis imperfecta in which bones break easily from little or no apparent cause. sometimes there is no identifiable cause of juvenile osteoporosis. this is known as idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis. two or more low-impact fractures may be a sign of one of these disorders. if you are concerned about a child's frequent fractures talk to a doctor for more information.
crohn's disease is an ongoing disorder that causes inflammation of the digestive tract also referred to as the gastrointestinal or gi tract. crohn's disease can affect any area of the gi tract from the mouth to the anus but it most commonly affects the lower part of the small intestine called the ileum. the swelling extends deep into the lining of the affected organ. the swelling can cause pain and can make the intestines empty frequently resulting in diarrhea.

as far as i know there is no cure for chf (although some people swear that they have been cured). but there are many treatment options to control the disease progression. there are diuretics to control fluid overload and medications to regulate the heart and improve breathing quality. long term survival with a diagnosis of chf is encouraging today. only a decade ago about 20% - 30% of folks with this condition survived five years after it being first detected. as of the year 2013 60% to 70% of people with it survive at least five years. given that many people are not diagnosed with chf until reaching their 8th decade of life it is not unusual for many of them to die within 5 years of being diagnosed. i know a woman who was diagnosed with chf asthma and copd at the age of 45 years old. she is now 63 years and promises to see her youngest grandchildren finish college (the two youngest grandchildren are presently only 2 years old). thats the type of attitude that is needed to keep your chf from destroying the joy of your life. the younger that you are when first diagnosed and the more vigilant you are about maintaining treatment directives (taking medications exactly as prescribed maintaining an ideal weight watch your fluid intake (limit it to about 48 ounces daily with your doctor's approval sounds right to me) keep your blood pressure within a good range consume a diet that is low in sodium sleep well exercise as permitted by your doctor and maintain a positive outlook there is no reason to look at chf as a death sentence. in summary: talk with your family doctor and cardiologist about your present symptoms. take a notebook with on your visit and ask the doctor's their advice on what you need to do in order to beat this disease. in that same notebook for the next 2 weeks annotate all of your daily activities medications taken and foods/liquids consumed. show your notebook to the doctors for their feedback. live a long and happy life by following the bolded recommendations above. i hope that this information has been helpful.

ambien is a very popular product used for insomnia and it can be very effective. people may experience drowsiness. they may experience kind of like a hangover feeling in the morning. they also have experienced in some cases where they have been found walking around at night or driving their cars. once again we want to make sure that patients are taking this the right way. i have patients who tell me that they are taking their medication at 7. 00 p. m. at night while they are downstairs on the couch watching tv not in bed like they are supposed to be and take it right before you go to bed. some people think too that they can take it at noontime because it's easier for them to remember. once again you have to follow the instructions; one at bedtime while you are in bed with a full glass of water. so most of these side effects can be prevented when you take the medication the right way. as a pharmacist i have no problem answering questions with patients about this. i know there is a lot of concern because of the fact that it causes a lot of drowsiness and things like that but once again if it's taken the right way. it actually can be very effective for patients.

a written prescription or the actual drug? i see nothing wrong with a doctor mailing a written prescription (some require a special triplicate form) to a legitimate pain patient that may not be able to make it to the office for medical reasons. obviously the use of any addicting medication should be carefully monitored. if the actual drug was mailed then i would be worried. doctors don't do this.
because you have had an ectopic pregnancy you are at a higher risk of this happening again. make sure you are not smoking; use caffeine minimally. you should have relations (sex) every 36-48 hours and not daily. make sure you take a vitamin daily. if you are having trouble getting pregnant you can have your fallopian tube evaluated something called an hsg. however i would not suggest you do this at this point in time. if you are greater than 35 some would call infertility more then 6 months.

unprotected intercourse at the time of ovulation can result in pregnancy. this is the most likely time of the month to get pregnant and this time frame is called a 'fertilty window'. after being released through ovulation an egg lives for 12- 24 hours. sperm can survive for three to five days. what this means is that pregnancy is possible with unprotected intercourse even before ovulation. the reason for this? : sperm released during sex 2-3 days prior to ovulation can survive until after ovulation. this can result in fertilization and pregnancy in someone that is sexually active not having a period is one of the most common signs of pregnancy. the simpliest way to determine if she is pregnant is a home pregnancy test which should be confirmed with an office visit and laboratory testing. the only way to know for sure if your girlfriend is pregnant is to have her take a pregnancy test. here is some information on pregnancy tests:  here is a few words on the symptoms of pregnancy:  take care!

cpk stands for creatine phosphokinase. its an enzyme found in high concentrations in muscles where it facilitates muscle contraction. cpk is also called creatine kinase or ck. doctors may check cpk when theres concern for muscle damage or breakdown: in a rare condition called rhabdomyolysis extreme muscle breakdown floods the blood with cpk and other chemicals in muscle cells. some of these are toxic to the kidneys making the condition dangerous. doctors may repeatedly check cpk levels in people with suspected rhabdomyolysis to assess any potential risk to the kidneys. people taking cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins sometimes have increases in cpk levels as a side effect of the medication. the heart is made of muscle and during a heart attack cpk leaks out of the heart along with other enzymes. a doctor may check cpk repeatedly over time in someone she suspects may be having a heart attack. troponin another enzyme present in the heart is often relied on more for this purpose than is cpk. cpk may be slightly elevated in many people after exercise or due to unclear reasons.

"the prostate is a gland located below the bladder of men. it surrounds the urethra (you-reeth-rah) which is a tube that drains urine from the bladder. bph is an enlargement of the prostate gland. the symptoms of bph however can be caused by an increase in the tightness of muscles in the prostate. if the muscles inside the prostate tighten they can squeeze the urethra and slow the flow of urine. this can lead to symptoms such as: a weak or interrupted stream when urinating. a feeling that you cannot empty your bladder completely. a feeling of delay when you start to urinate. a need to urinate often especially at night or a feeling that you must urinate right away. treatment options for bph there are three main treatment options for bph: program of monitoring or ""watchful waiting.

studies of the effects of exercise in preventing heart attacks have yielded conflicting results. this is likely because of the fact that people who exercise regularly generally have healthier lifestyles. many risk factors for heart disease  weight blood pressure diabetes blood cholesterol and smoking  can be influenced by exercise. therefore the specific role of exercise itself in heart attack prevention is difficult to isolate.

because the bacteria that cause tuberculosis are transmitted through the air the disease can be contagious. but it's nearly impossible to catch tb by a single social contact with an infected person. to be at risk of being infected you must be exposed to tb bacteria constantly by living or working in close quarters with someone who has the active disease. even then because the bacteria generally stay latent (inactive) after they invade the body only 10% of people infected with tb will ever have the active disease. the remaining 90% have what's called latent tb infection  they show no signs of infection and won't be able to spread the disease to others. these latent infections can eventually become active though so even people without symptoms should receive medical treatment. medication can help get rid of the inactive bacteria before they become active.

what we are finding out is that therapy needs to be individualized for these patients. patients may start off on one product like protonix. they need to take it though for usually two weeks to 30 days to see if there is any benefit to it. over time there are many different products that are available prescription and people are all different. we are finding out that if you take a pill and i take a pill it's going to work differently in both of us. for some patients it works really well and for others they might need to be switched. this can be a common occurrence in patients who were formerly taking nexium or prevacid. sometimes some of them do work a little quicker but it does depend on the person. so therapy needs to be individualized. as a pharmacist i recommend my patients to definitely keep a diary to keep track of their symptoms see if it is actually helping them. after a month i may ask them how are they feeling. if they tell me they are not feeling well i am probably going to advice them that they need to call their physician or healthcare provider to have it reassessed.
thank you for asking. you don't give the age of the child but it's worth noting that most people's flatulence (farting) has an odor. sometimes it's worse than others and the odor of a person's farts can vary from hour to hour or day by day. usually the smell of farts doesn't mean anything bad. many foods produce gas in the intestines. different foods can cause smelly farts in some people but not in others. eggs frequently cause stinky farts in many people as does broccoli. i wouldn't jump to the conclusion that a child's smelly gas indicates a medical problem. if the child has a good appetite and is eating a balanced diet with no other digestive problems (chronic diarrhea cramps bloating) then there's probably nothing wrong. just because one parent has a family history of digestive problems doesn't mean a child will inherit these. it's worth mentioning this history to the child's pediatrician who can help you monitor for diseases. wishing you well!
let's look at the ingredients of each of these medications separately. vicodin contains hydrocodone and acetaminophen. fioricet contains acetaminophen butalbital and caffeine. i would be cautious in using both products in order to prevent overdosing of acetaminophen. this medication while safe as an over-the-counter medication can cause damage to the liver at extreme doses. if you need to take both medications consult your local pharmacist to discuss the correct dose for you.

post partum depression like other forms of major depression may last for months or even years if untreated. it is not your fault. eighteen months is too long to have endured those feelings of sadness. certainly with a husband working long hours and not being in an area with close friends and family can also contribute to depression. only a mental health professional trained in depressive disorders can properly diagnosis whether you are experiencing ppd some other form of depression or a combination of these maladies. you may also have a medical condition that results in causing depression as a symptom. i respectively make the following suggestions: 1. ) talk with your husband about your sadness. if he is not approachable then seek the counsel of your physician (this individual can conduct medical testing as well as assess your overall mental state prescribe medication and make mental health referrals) or a minister / priest /rabbi. they can act as a sounding board to express your feelings and offer positive suggestions on restoring joy in your life. 2. ) consider joining a self-help group to support your efforts at regaining purpose in your life. you deserve to feel worthy to have friendships and to feel and give love. through talk therapy and medications the prognosis is encouraging.

why do you really care? the presence of an intact hymen (located at the vaginal opening) is not a definitive sign of virginity since the hymen can spontaneously rupture from riding a bike riding a horse or using a tampon. a male who is getting this close to your vagina does not likely have the medical skills to make any type of determination. at this point men are more interested in just having sex. you have the right to keep your secrets or share them. that is your decision.
"you ask a good question. i wish i had a good answer. it's impossible to say what the ""best treatment"" for any given condition is and that includes atrial fibrillation (a-fib). there are many treatments available for a-fib including blood thinners. catheter ablation also is a fine treatment for a-fib. i understand outcomes are very good with that particular procedure. whenever you or a loved one is facing a problem like a-fib you should ask a lot of questions of the physician. it's perfectly ok to ask about all the various treatment options available. what are the benefits and risks of each treatment? why does your doctor recommend one particular treatment over another? any good cardiologist will welcome these questions from a patient because it shows you're engaged in managing your own care. if you don't understand something the doctor is explaining don't hesitate to speak up and say so. always bring a family member or friend along to appointments to ask questions as well. the more ""ears"" in the exam room the better! wishing you well!"

medical spas buyer beware because a medical spa implies that theres some medical treatments. often theres a staff physician or a nurse as opposed to just a traditional day spa. and so yes there are procedures that are offered. the question is whether thats the best environment for that. why would it not be? well it depends on how much on site supervision there is by a physician and what is the physicians specialty because by routine typically there is a dermatologist or a cosmetic surgeon available and sometimes on site but for some spas the so called medical director could be a pediatrician it could be a heart surgeon participating in a business enterprise. you just need to know that you have to have a license to be a medical director but the question is what specialty is that licensed doctor carry? how can a pediatrician or a heart surgeon actually do cosmetic procedures? that doesnt even make sense well they are really not doing the procedures in some of the spas and im not saying that this is the rule but there are some that we know about. they dont do them. they are really done by often very experienced and sophisticated nurse practitioners who specialize in that type of work. but there are some medical issues that can come up particularly suitability. should one have such and such a procedure? a given skin peel or the injections because not everyone is a candidate for these things. its not like shopping at a supermarket where you just take something off the shelf. there has to be some consideration for the right substance the right treatment and for the right skin and the right type of person in respect to their health. so thats where the system breaks down if in fact the supervising doctor hasnt been raised in the world of cosmetic surgery. and are most of them raised in the world of cosmetic surgery? dr. kotler: most most are raised in the cosmetic surgery world but not all and we do hear stories about physicians kind of migrating in to the medical spa because its uhm its a business its an investment opportunity or often the spa may be owned by business men and theyve appointed dr. x to be the quote medical director. but its good to have a sense of whos at the controls. whos responsible and who will be there if theres a problem. 15 all medical treatments have some potential for you know delayed healing some minor complications. who is going to be the backup? now lets say that there are doctors on hand. are those necessarily well trained doctors? that can vary. typically you see in a spa the doctor wouldnt be there all the time because he has to spend most of his time in the office or in the operating room. so again it depends but i think its a great question for someone considering a medical treatment and im not talking about a non medical treatment were not talking pedicures here but if someones considering having a botox injection or restylane or any type of skin peel any type of rejuvenative procedure done by a physician or a nurse you need to know what is that doctors background. is he or she really an expert or has the doctor kind of migrated into this field for whatever reason.

that's a great question and i'm glad you're asking it. so many people don't stop to think about possible drug interactions with over-the-counter medications. good for you! your best bet is to ask your pharmacist. he or she will have your entire medication profile available and can tell you if alka seltzer plus is appropriate for you. if not your pharmacist can recommend something that will work for you. hope this helps!
no. your menstrual cycle messed up all by itself. the vitamins are not responsible.
hi this seems to be a side effect of using the drug for so long. it causes changes in cardiovascular and respiratory systems causing tight chest pains. this is usually temporary. get ecg done and consult a physician if it occurs frequently. thanks
your chance of being pregnant 3 days before period is due is low. the only factor that may affect this chance is your period is irregular so your true time of ovulation may not be when you expect it to be. your highest chance of becoming pregnant is 14days prior to period but nothing is 100% except abstinence and using a latex properly fitting condom. these not only reduce your chance of pregnancy but diseases and you having to raise a baby before your ready. i know the reaction to condoms usually goes like this. your bf hates those things and you are in love am i right? think of this is. is love and your bf's comfort worth your life and or future? i am not lecturing but hopefully giving you something to think about before the next time you have to post a question like this. take care of yourself
in my opinion you need to test fot hiv also check your thyroid levels also do you take antidepressant medications? they can cause dry mouth as they r usually anti histaminics good luck
"penis enlargement pills are worthless. pure quackery. you can not medically increase the size of your penis. your hands. your feet. your nose. anything using a ""supplement"". as an adult what you have is what you got my friend. remember that it isn't the size it is how you use it. your most sensitive sexual organ in a loving and caring relationship is between your ears (your brain)."
"one of your questions is "" are these (symptoms) just the effects of stress? "" i don't think that they are just stress related. you are also not ""crazy"" as suggested in your post. schizophrenic individuals for example feel that their hallucinations are real while you definitely live in a state of reality in being aware that you are daydreaming. maladaptive daydreaming (preoccupation with daydreaming where large blocks of daily time are spent fantasying) ) is not well understood by many medical professionals. its cause is unknown. some of your symptoms like feeling paranoid intense and complex daydreaming (can be so realistic that its as though you're reading a novel) and feeling anxious can all be related to the one disorder maladaptive daydreaming. here's what you can do: look for triggers that may set of the daydreaming episodes. some activities like playing video games may activate the daydreaming and oftentimes associated fantasies; be good to yourself and realize that you'll have good and bad days with mdd. look for positive ways to plan and spend your time and divert your actions away from daydreaming; find a physician that thoroughly understands maladaptive daydreaming and follow their treatment directions. with talk therapy and medications you can decrease these unwanted chucks of wasted time being taken away from what should be a productive day. i am optimistic about your future."
no. the machine will not denature any of your medications or interfere with their stability.
of course not. folic acid is not sperm. only sperm can cause a pregnancy.
i would not recommend taking supplemental iron unless you are anemic or are instructed to so by your doctor. you may want to consider trying a good multivitamin which will have some iron in it. talk to your doctor about what would be best for you. taking high doses of iron when not needed can be dangerous but this would be very unlikely.
hi i totally agree with you this does not make sense can you please upload your mri scan to see it for my self? thank you
nasal polyps are a high possibility. such polyps are long standing cause production of abnormal discharge and allergic symptoms. you should get examined by a sinoscope and a nasal endoscopy to rule out this possibilty. a underlying lung pathology needs consideration

you will probably be just fine. hand-washing and intact skin (on your hands) is an excellent defense against the transmission of viruses. that was a nice act of kindness (the money not the lighter). it would be highly highly unlikely that this brief touching of the hands would result in you contracting any disease. don't be bummed out (pun intended).
i have had a bad chest cold since friday (today is tues). i am starting to feel better but still coughing especially at night with what i consider a productive deep cough. i work around seniors and am wondering if i should hold off from going back to work a little longer?
treating uc means finding a drug therapy that works for you. whatever therapy youre on its considered maintenance meaning you have to take it to control symptoms and as soon as you stop your symptoms can return  says eric esrailian md mph chief of development and section head of general gastroenterology at the david geffen school of medicine at ucla. treatments for uc are primarily oral or topical. generally a mainstay treatment is a class of drugs called 5-aminosalicylates which have an anti-inflammatory effect on the bowel to help minimize flare-ups  esrailian explains. another class is the immunomodulators which suppress the immune system to calm any unnecessary activity in the bowel. biologic agents are another option for more severe disease as are corticosteroids in the short-term. while the internet touts treatments such as probiotics omega-3 fatty acids and herbal remedies like boswellia  a gum resin from the boswellia tree  the scientific research hasnt quite caught up. theres not a lot of clear evidence because alternative therapies are not rigorously studied  says esrailian.
take a look at healthcare. gov. you'll be led to your state's page and you can start to take a look at health plans and costs. with the income you've stated you'll no doubt qualify for subsidized coverage. in addition you'll qualify for lower out-of-pocket costs each time you go for medical care.
eat a healthy diet. limit your consumption of salt (sodium) to less than 2 000 milligrams (2 grams) each day. eat foods high in fiber and potassium. limit foods high in fat cholesterol and sugar. reduce total daily intake of calories to lose weight if necessary. exercise regularly. a regular cardiovascular exercise program prescribed by your doctor will improve symptoms and strength and make you feel better. it may also decrease heart failure progression. don't overdo it. plan your activities and include rest periods during the day. certain activities such as pushing or pulling heavy objects and shoveling may worsen heart failure. prevent respiratory infections. ask your doctor about flu and pneumonia vaccines. take your medications as prescribed. do not stop taking them without first contacting your doctor. get emotional or psychological support if needed. heart failure can be difficult for your whole family. if you have questions ask your doctor or nurse. if you need emotional support social workers psychologists clergy and heart failure support groups are a phone call away. ask your doctor or nurse to point you in the right direction.
i'm sorry to hear your husband's going through this. although i'm clearly not an orthopedic surgeon i may be able to shed some light on this. while there's no direct link between a lumbar laminectomy and bulging discs in the cervical spine it is possible that the patient could succumb to poor posture and body mechanics in order to relieve pain in the lumbar spine. this could in turn lead to upper-back pain (likely muscular not skeletal). in terms of how the laminectomy could ultimately cause problems farther up the spinal column here's what can happen. if you fuse two vertebrae together they cannot flex and bend naturally anymore. this puts a lot of stress on the vertebra directly above (in the case of lumber; below in the case of cervical) the fusion. after many years the battered vertebra or spinal disc can degenerate or collapse leading to the need for another laminectomy or fusion. this will again put stress on the next vertebra/disc up and so on. people who have vertebral fusions at a younger age run the risk of needing additional surgeries as the years go by due to the problems i described above. i have no idea if any of this is going on with your husband. it's highly unlikely his cervical spine problems are related to his lumbar laminectomy. nonetheless back problems stink and i hope he's able to find treatments that give him relief!
it could be normal finding or you may have cardiac trouble so to rule out this do echo
i had the same issue. 1-2hours a day in the gym cardio and weights 4-5 days a wk eating 1200 calories only lost 2 lbs in 4 months. turns out there is so much msg in food that it was hindering my progress. i switched to eating only organic food with light exercise and lost 5 lbs. in one week. i also stopped getting head aches and back aches. i even gained energy and improved disposition. (msg is an excitotoxin used to get mice fat and stay that way in order to research diabetes. -there are over 40 types of msg under different names and it is in 95 percent of foods you find in stores. ) 
stopping of pills should be accompanied by a good healthy diet and a healthy lifestyle. u need to do exercises yoga. this will prevent the withdrawal after â€“ symptoms that occur after stopping of the medicines. thanks
i don't think it will matter or change the effectiveness. you can probably mix it with just about anything but it still may not be very palatable. it will likely make you tea taste yucky too.
find new doctor!
i hate waiting but you should probably wait to see if you miss your period and take a test then. or you could go see your ob/gyn and they can give you a test there.
my hubby same way. he is currently in rehab. learning how to walk again. he had a stroke. he has been in rest home for a month now and can't come till he walks with walker. our house is not adaptable to wheel chair.
yes you could be. birth control can cause you to get pregnant if you miss a pill or take a pill later than you were suposed to
iÌ‡n my opinion you should get examined for a back scoliosis / kyphosis posture by physical examination and x ray on the whole back. as the problem of a depresses rib and continous muscle spasm that relieved by muscle relaxant and relaxation training could originally be caused by postural deformity.
"it is important for women to know that breast cancer can be a man's disease as well. this also means that a genetic link can come from a male relative. fortunately the symptom you describe is not likely to be linked to breast cancer risk. it is not uncommon for women to be able to get small amounts of nipple discharge after having breastfed. the usual triggers for this to occurs are: nipple stimulation a a part of sexual foreplay hot showers birth control pills or ""checking for discharge"" by repeated squeezing. sometimes women will notice discharge from one or both nipples. this prompts concern especially if she has not recently breast fed. generally we tell women that bilateral white or clear discharge which is only present with nipple stimulation is likely to be ""normal. "" as mentioned above being on birth control pills can sometimes enhance breast discharge. certain psychiatric medicationsâ€”especially the antipsychotics â€”can initiate nipple discharge. bilateral spontaneous secretions can be prompted by a pituitary problem or hypothyroidism. both low thyroid and elevated prolactin (from the pituitary gland) can be checked for using simple blood tests. the most concerning nipple discharges are those which are red/bloody unilateral and coming from just one or two ducts. if you were my patient i would check a sample of the discharges for undiscernable blood (using the fecal blood card). i would do a careful breast exam and might send you for a mammogram or ultrasoundâ€”depending upon your age. i prefer to be safe rather than sorryeven when the discharge sounds non-pathologic. so get it checked out even though it is likely that you will be told it is ok."
no normal multivitamins or iron supplements should not impact birth control pill effectiveness.
i can understand your concern regarding your symptoms and side effects of the medications. the symptoms you mentioned above are showing that you are suffering from dysthymia and moderate depression. depression itself is a cause of poor sexual drive. lexapro that is escitalopram may cause loss of libido and sexual dysfunction as you have already stopped this medicine long ago depression is the primary cause of your symptoms. i will suggest you try taking newer invented molecules like vilazodone. this drug has no daytime somnolence and sexual dysfunction. it will help you in early recovery. take it for at least three months and then stop slowly by tapering. consult your specialist doctor discuss with him or her and start taking medicine after their consent. within a couple of weeks you will feel better and these drugs have fewer chances of withdrawal depression when they are stopped and tapered slowly. behavioral therapies like cbt (cognitive behavioral therapy) or dbt (dialectical behavioral therapy) and counseling will help you to cope up your stress and will help you to maintain a happy state of mind. visit a nearby psychiatrist for a proper prescription and counseling. your symptoms are curable 20 % of the population spend some part of their life in depression and half of them overcome with this illness. hope my answer helped you. for further queries consult a psychiatrist online

sounds like your stools are just a bit out of wack. a laxative can cause diarrhea so that part is normal. the question is why did you think you needed one? to get your stools back on track increase your daily amount of fiber. that means more fruit veggies whole grains and beans in your diet. if you start eating these at every meal you should see an improvment in a few days to a werek. if you just can't stomach those types of foods there are plenty of otc supplements that are inexpensive and and work well for most people. ask your pharmacist to show you some examples. if your problems last longer than a month or you notice black tar like stools see your doctor.

allergy shots or immunotherapy are injections of tiny doses of allergens that produce allergy relief in up to 90% of patients with seasonal allergies according to the american academy of allergy asthma & immunology (aaaai). these injections are effective for reducing allergy symptoms associated with cat dander pollens house dust mites certain molds and fire ant bites. your doctor will give shots of weak allergen solutions once or twice a week initially. over time your doctor will give you regular injections of your allergens in increasing strength to stimulate changes in the immune system and reduce the chance of future allergy symptoms. allergy shots or immunotherapy bring allergy relief by turning off allergic disease at the source. by stimulating changes in the immune system over time you develop fewer allergic reactions and allergy symptoms.

the poison ivy rash usually starts one or two days after exposure though the delay between contact and its onset can be longer up to several days. this may lead to confusion over where the exposure took place. the first signs of the rash are curved lines of red itchy bumps or blisters. these continue to appear for many days depending on how much resin touched the skin at a given point. this makes it seem as though the rash is spreading although the fluid in blisters is just part of the allergic reaction and contains no chemicals or bacteria. it also makes it appear that there may still be poison ivy in clothes and/or on pets. although this is theoretically possible repeated washing of these often produces no improvement. poison ivy is not contagious neither from one person to someone else nor from one part of the body to another. many references emphasize that animals can carry the poison ivy resin. there's no doubt this is true but its practical significance may be limited. the first sign of poison ivy after all is usually a curved line of rash on the skin. unless your dog is shaped like a curved line your poison ivy is more likely to have come from a stem or leaf which dragged against the skin not from your pet.
most helpful answer there is absolutely no way to make a blind determination whether you have a sprain strain or fracture based solely on the information in your posting. as much as i would like help you the only way that you can achieve this answer is to have a hands-on medical examination and most likely an x-ray or other imaging studies.
it is my understanding that you do have to take long term - if you go off the meds your cholesterol is going to go back up - unless you can make lifestyle changes to address but it sounds like yours is more genetic (family history). here are the recommended lifestyle changes that i found on webmd: eat foods with less fat saturated fat and cholesterol. take off the skin and fat from meat poultry and fish. eat food that has been broiled baked roasted or poached instead of fried. eat lots of fruits and vegetables everyday. eat lots of cereals breads rice and pasta made from whole grains such as whole wheat bread or spaghetti. get 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise everyday. talk to your doctor about the safest and best ways for you to exercise. lose weight if you are overweight. stop smoking. take your high blood cholesterol medication as prescribed by your doctor. here's the original article:  hope this helps.

most helpful answer the burn on or near a birthmark should be appropriately treated like any burn to avoid an infection and minimalize scarring. most first and superficial second degree burns will not scar but that depends on your own scarring potential (varies from person to person) and of course not all birthmarks are the same. i don't have any idea what type of birthmark that you have. when in doubt seeks hands on professional care. a dermatologist would be your best consultant in this case.

"the short answer is ""no. "" you cannot get west nile virus by coming in contact with a person who has the illness. west nile virus is spread by infected mosquitos. you can only get west nile virus if you are bitten by an infected mosquito. the best way to avoid getting west nile virus is to use an insect repellent whenever you plan to be outdoors during the summer and fall when the mosquito population is highest. the centers for disease control recommends using a product that contains one of these active ingredients:  deet  picaridin  oil of lemon eucalyptus (or pmd)  ir3535 mosquito activity increases at dusk and dawn. if you must be outside during these times use insect repellant and wear long sleeves and pants if possible. the key to avoiding west nile virus is to avoid being bitten by an infected mosquito. symptoms of the illness may include headache nausea vomiting a stiff neck or muscle weakness. if you have been exposed to mosquito bites and have any of these symptoms see your healthcare provider."
that's a great question and one many people are concerned with. first there are a few reasons why insurers can still charge higher rates. they can charge an older person up to 3x that of a younger person they can charge up to 50% more if you smoke and they can take into account where you live because medical care costs vary across the country. however the condition of your health cannot influence your costs. the main concern now is whether enough young healthy people will sign up for health insurance through the marketplaces. if they do the expectation is that the market will even out and prices won't spike. if however only older sicker people sign up costs could rise. we won't know for a while how it all turns out.
there is no evidence that adipex interacts with birth control pills or that it makes you infertile. however women on birth control pills are at a higher risk of blood clots that can cause heart attacks and strokes. adipex can raise your heart rate and blood pressure which also increases your risk of blood clots that cause heart attacks and strokes. so be sure that the health care professional prescribing your adipex is aware that you take birth control pills and that he/she can monitor you appropriately.
what are you treating? fevers in children are not dangerous. as a matter of fact fevers are therapeutic by helping to fight infection. the only reason to give a child ibuprofen or acetaminophen would be for comfort and it is certainly okay to do that. many people  mostly those fearful of fever  use both alternating acetaminophen and ibuprofen but studies have not proven that this is really necessary. is it safe? probably; they are two different drugs. i tell my patient to just pick one and use it sparingly. if they want me to choose i go for the ibuprofen. it lasts longer is anti-inflammatory and is safer. benadryl use in children is iffy too. it can dry up a runny nose for 2-4 hours but then it wears off and has to be repeated again. in adults benadryl can make you sleepy but in children it can actually stimulate them (this is called a paradoxical effect). benadryl is safe if your child is not having any adverse effects.
there are several reasons why your doctor might want you to be on bed rest. for example your doctor may recommend bed rest if you experience early contractions which could be signs of preterm labor or if you have had previous pregnancies that ended in miscarriage still birth or premature birth. if you are expecting multiples  two or more babies  your pregnancy may be considered high risk and your doctor will monitor you closely. if you develop any problems your doctor might place you on bed rest. following are some other reasons your doctor may advise bed rest: preeclampsia. a potentially dangerous condition characterized by high blood pressure protein in the urine and swelling particularly in the legs and face. preeclampsia occurs in up to 8% of pregnancies usually during the second half of pregnancy. vaginal bleeding. a problem with several possible causes including placenta previa a complication in which the placenta grows in the lowest part of the uterus and covers all or part of the opening to the cervix; or placental abruption a complication in which the placenta separates from the uterus before the baby is ready to be born. incompetent cervix. a weak cervix that may open prematurely. cervical effacement. softening or thinning of the cervix which is one of the first signs of labor. poor fetal development. a test or procedure that indicates a medical complication.
i would suggest you consult your ob-gyn as soon as possible about this. there may be nothing at all wrong but you do want someone to take a peek in there to make sure everything looks normal. an appointment with your ob-gyn also would be a good opportunity to discuss whether you should continue having sex during your pregnancy given this symptom. wishing you and your baby all the best!
i'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time. before going the medication route which has not been shown to be very effective i highly recommend you see a registered dietitian for guidance. you can ask your doctor or go to eatright. org to find a dietitian in your area. it's important for you to understand why this happened in the first place so you can develop a plan that will be a long-term solution and not just result in short-term weight loss followed by weight regain. a dietitian will work with your history lifestyle and preferences to help you develop a realistic plan. most people don't realize that dieting leads to weight gain over time. how you handle your weight now can make a big difference in your lifelong health. i know it's frustrating to be carrying this extra weight but you won't regret taking the time to choose an approach that gets to the root of the problem. for sensible tips on managing weight after baby see this webmd article.

it's what feels right to you. personally running helped me a lot. swimming on the other hand did not. yoga was challenging but i just didn't get the same results i did after a hard run. when i run i feel empower after and even if i'm on the edge of having a panic attack when i leave the house i can chase that feeling away. i've avoided quite a few panic attacks by running. i've been having less of them too. i started to work out everyday and now i'm having less panic attacks. just try different things out. try yoga try running try walking try workout apps. whatever makes you feel better is the best exercise. i'm not a doctor but running has been helping me so i thought i'd chime in.
"he has a ethical and legal responsibility to refill your medications until your medical visit. or give you a sooner appointment. should you have a spike in your blood pressure that results in a stroke or heart attack he will be held responsible. remind the receptionist of this. send the doctor a fax so he will read your concerns first hand. do not wean off of your meds. he he still will not refill them. go to an urgent care facility bring your bottles and ask for an ""emergency refill"". then shop around for a more compassionate doctor to manage your high blood pressure."

surgery for shingles is quite rare and limited to only the most severe and prolonged cases of postherpetic neuralgia the most common complication of shingles. postherpetic neuralgia can be an ongoing and debilitating problem especially for older people but it usually decreases over time. when all other medical treatments fail to reduce or control pain you and your doctor may consider surgical options. surgery to relieve postherpetic neuralgia interrupts the path of pain signals to the brain by cutting nerves in the skull or spinal column. there are significant risks to this surgery. if surgery is recommended it is a good idea to get a second opinion before proceeding. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

yes it is possible to have feelings of depression if you have bpd. borderline personality disorder is frequently misdiagnosed for bipolar or manic depression. the unstable moods associated with both conditions have in fact lead some researchers to believe that they are variants of each other. mood stabilizer drugs and talk therapy seem to be the best approach to help people with borderline personality disorder manage anxiety depression and aggression. at the same time it can help those suffering from this disorder deal with daily living. talk therapy can help you focus on understanding how your thoughts and behaviors effect yourself and others. it also helps you find more effective ways for you to approach daily stressors that could trigger negative or harmful behavior.

if you are diagnosed with high blood pressure it's important to see your doctor on a regular basis. he or she can answer your questions during these visits. however there may be other times when you may need to speak to your doctor sooner. these include if you aren't responding to the prescribed treatment and your blood pressure is still high and if you are having any side effects from the blood pressure medication. if this happens your doctor may wish to adjust the dosage of the medication or put you on another medication.
i also have rosacea and had the same happen to me 2 years ago. my md treated me with multiple gels creams including a steroid cream to no avail. he suggested i try otc lamasil for athletes foot. it worked! i recently broke out again on the opposite side of my mouth and at first tried the other creams first since it had been over a year since last flair up. my rash spread to my chin and was very itchy then i remembered the lamasil and after just 24 hrs. it's calmed down not itching and very light. some of those creams cost me $130. -200. each! very frustrating that it took months alot of money embarrassing problematic rash to be cured with a inexpensive otc treatment!

thalasemia is a genetic condition where the body either does not make enough hemoglobin or the hemoglobin it makes is not normal. hemoglobin is a component of red blood cells that helps spread oxygen throughout the body. to make hemoglobin the body needs both alpha-globin and beta-globin. alpha thalasemia occurs if there are problems with some or all of the alph-globin genes. beta thalasemia occurs when there are problems with one or both of the beta-globin genes. here is a link to an article about thalassemia with lots of info.  take care
hi dear it seems that the doctor is confused regarding the findings herself. a gestational sac is usually seen in the uterus and rarely in the ovaries. a old bleed in the ovarian region can mimic of a polycystic ovary i agree. if you have bled 2 days and if the pregnancy test is negative then this wont be a gestational sac for sure. get a 2nd opinion from another gynecologist before taking any major decisions. if you could have scan image i could have guided you better. see. if its possible. thanks

health plans that were already in place prior to the affordable care act becoming law (march 23 2010) and that haven't made major changes to benefits are considered grandfathered. these plans are exempt from some parts of the health reform law such as making preventive health services available to you at no cost. there are a few good ways to check the status of your plan. you can review your company's health plan materials which must include this information. if you get insurance at work you can also ask a representative from human resource or the plan's benefits administrator. finally you can call the 800 number on the back of your insurance card and ask your plan directly about the status.

under the law there is financial assistance to help make the cost of coverage more affordable. people with very low incomes in states that expanded their medicaid programs may qualify for low or no cost coverage through that program. people with incomes below about $46 000 per year qualify for tax credits to lower the cost of insurance premiums. the lower your income the more help you'll get. in addition if you earn less than roughly $29 000 you may qualify for reduced cost-sharing. that means you'll pay less when you go for medical care. you should log onto healthcare. gov right away. you'll be able to plug in your income information and learn if you qualify for financial assistance. open enrollment closes this sunday february 15th so you need to act now to get health insurance for 2015. once open enrollment closes you won't have a chance to buy insurance for the remainder of the year.
not worried but definitely concerned. your daughter should be evaluated by her pediatrician first and then by a pediatric endocrinologist. the main concern of course would be that she has precocious puberty. what can start out as breast buds could progress to pubic hair if her little brain is somehow sending out singles to her ovaries that she is older than her chronological age. we do not want a four-year old wearing a bra by kindergarten. a bra would not be the major concern however. it would be all of the other bodily changes that start at puberty that is a larger concern. infants can have breast buds due to maternal estrogen but when a four-year old develops breast buds from making estrogen on her own it is concerning and this must be properly evaluated.

crohn's disease causes inflammation in the small intestine. crohn's disease usually occurs in the lower part of the small intestine called the ileum but it can affect any part of the digestive tract from the mouth to the anus. the inflammation extends deep into the lining of the affected organ. the inflammation can cause pain and can make the intestines empty frequently resulting in diarrhea. crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) the general name for diseases that cause inflammation in the intestines. crohn's disease can be difficult to diagnose because its symptoms are similar to other intestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome and to another type of ibd called ulcerative colitis. ulcerative colitis causes inflammation and ulcers in the top layer of the lining of the large intestine. crohn's disease affects men and women equally and seems to run in some families. about 20 percent of people with crohn's disease have a blood relative with some form of ibd most often a brother or sister and sometimes a parent or child. crohn's disease may also be called ileitis or enteritis.

"i generally recommend that my patients start introducing proteins (such as meat and dairy) at about 7 months  assuming that there are no dairy allergies/intolerances. full fat dairy is what we usually recommend until age two years. meats such as beef and poultry are usually well tolerated. the proteins to stay away from until one year of age are: fish seafood egg whites and nuts. each pediatrician tends to offer different advice as to when to introduce these ""allergenic"" proteins so please ask your doctor about his/her preferences."

"it is not clear what causes panic disorder. in many people who have the biological vulnerability to panic attacks, they may develop in association with major life changes (such as getting married, having a child or starting a first job) and major lifestyle stressors. there is also some evidence that suggests that the tendency to develop panic disorder may run in families. people who suffer from panic disorder are also more likely than others to suffer from depression, attempt suicide, or to abuse alcohol or drugs."
"doctors usually define diarrhea as a significant increase in the total weight of stool passed in a single day. most people however think of diarrhea as an illness during which they have more frequent loose watery stools. almost everyone has diarrhea at some point in his or her life. in developing countries where illnesses that cause diarrhea are more common and where health care is less readily available diarrhea is a major health concern because of its potential to cause severe life-threatening dehydration. infants and the elderly are more prone to dehydration from diarrhea. diarrhea that comes on suddenly and goes away over a period of a couple of weeks is usually referred to as ""acute diarrhea. "" most people with acute diarrhea recover on their own. diarrhea that lasts more than four weeks is thought of as ""chronic diarrhea. "" typically chronic diarrhea requires medical care to find the underlying cause and treat complications such as dehydration."
"many women have some amount of vaginal bleeding during pregnancy. some studies show that up to 30% of pregnant women will experience some degree of vaginal bleeding while they are pregnant. vaginal bleeding during pregnancy is more common with twins and other multiple gestations than with singleton pregnancies (pregnancy with one fetus). sometimes women experience a very scant amount of bleeding in the first two weeks of pregnancy usually around the time of the expected menstrual period. this slight bleeding is sometimes referred to as ""implantation bleeding. "" doctors do not know for certain what causes this bleeding but it may occur as a result of the fertilized egg implanting in the uterine wall. the amount of the bleeding the stage of pregnancy and any associated symptoms can all help determine the cause of vaginal bleeding in pregnancy. while vaginal bleeding in pregnancy does not signify a problem with the pregnancy women who experience bleeding during pregnancy should always be evaluated by a doctor. causes of vaginal bleeding in pregnancy include miscarriage an abnormal location of the placenta ectopic pregnancy cervical infection or polyp and premature labor. chronic medical conditions and medication use can also be related to vaginal bleeding during pregnancy."

"trading off [exercise time with a spouse] is a good idea. something else you can do is incorporate exercise into your time with the kids. for me playing catch or street hockey bumping a volleyball or shooting hoops with my kids is a great way to have bonding time playtime and exercise all in one. for younger kids rolling around on the floor dancing to music or piggy back rides can be a workout as well. there's only so much time in a day and i can't always get up at 5:30 am for a ""real"" workout so adding exercise to my everyday activities helps. it recharges and refreshes me. it's a great way to connect as a family."

researchers have long known that older people are more likely to get phn (postherpetic neuralgia) the nerve pain after shingles but recent studies have found other factors that increase risks. in one study published in the journal neurology researchers  including robert h. dworkin phd a professor in the department of anesthesiology at the university of rochester medical center in rochester n. y  looked at data from 965 people with shingles. the researchers identified five risk factors for developing phn in people who had been recently diagnosed with shingles: older female presence of symptoms before the rash appeared like numbness tingling itching or pain severe pain during the illness' initial stages severe rash. importantly the researchers found the more risk factors you have the greater the risk of developing phn. for instance 17% of women with shingles went on to get phn. 26% of people with severe pain did too. but 50% of women who were over 60 and had symptoms before the rash severe rash and acute pain went on to get phn.
if you have questions or concerns discuss them with your health care provider. treatment options for children with depression are similar to those for adults including psychotherapy (counseling) and medication. the role that family and the child's environment play in the treatment process is different from that of adults. your child's doctor may suggest psychotherapy first and consider antidepressant medicine as an additional option if there is no significant improvement. the best studies to date indicate that a combination of psychotherapy and medication is most effective. however studies do show that the antidepressant prozac is effective in treating depression in children and teens. the drug is officially recognized by the fda for treatment of children 8-18 with depression. treating children with bipolar disorder children with bipolar disorder are usually treated with psychotherapy and a combination of medicines usually an antidepressant and a mood stabilizer. use of an antidepressant alone can trigger bouts of manic and hyperactive behavior. the fda has determined that antidepressant medications increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior in children and adolescents with depression and other psychiatric disorders. if you have questions or concerns discuss them with your health care provider.

most hernia repairs can be done with a variety of anesthetic methods. with modern general anesthetic techniques and monitoring general anesthesia can be very safe. however the surgery can also be performed under local anesthesia or regional anesthetics often using sedation medications at the same time to help relax the patient. the specific type of anesthetic for an individual patient is selected after careful evaluation of the patient's general health and individual concerns.
styes (hordeolum) are not contagious or infectious like conjunctivitis (pink eye). they are really just inflamed oil-glands. yes these things can be very nasty-looking but they do not pose any risk to customers. as long as the cook maintains a high-level of personal hygiene (hand washing not trying to touch/squeeze these painful lesions) he is capable of working. if the cook is in full-view of customers as he is preparing their meals it could result in a few double-takes from people who may not understand the nature of styes. i work closely with children and babies every day. if i had a big stye i would probably just stay home apply some hot compresses and wait for it to resolve. i pose no risk to the babies but i would get tired of explaining my eye to parents. in general a stye is not contagious so it's not a problem for a cook to continue to work. as always you would want to still practice good hand hygiene. here's a previous answer by dr. hoffman on this same issue: 
you have conjunctivitis it starts like that then it becomes too worse your eye starts to produce alot of discharge and it becomes very red. to treat it you will need to use hyaline and tobramyacin. i recommend a visit to an ophthalmologist to prescribe medications for you.

celiac disease is suspected when individuals have signs or symptoms of malabsorption or malnutrition. other diseases however can produce malabsorption and malnutrition for example pancreatic insufficiency (a pancreas that is not able to produce digestive enzymes) crohn's disease of the small intestine and small intestinal overgrowth of bacteria. it is important therefore to confirm suspected celiac disease with appropriate testing. small intestinal biopsy small intestinal biopsy is considered the most accurate test for celiac disease. small intestinal biopsies can be obtained by performing an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (egd). during an egd the doctor inserts a long flexible viewing endoscope through the mouth and into the duodenum. a long flexible biopsy instrument is then passed through a small channel in the endoscope to obtain samples of the intestinal lining of the duodenum. multiple samples usually are obtained to increase the accuracy of the diagnosis. a pathologist then can examine the biopsies (under a microscope) for loss of villi and other characteristics of celiac disease such as increased numbers of lymphocytes. small intestinal biopsy does however have some limitations. for example acute viral gastroenteritis and allergy to cow's milk or soy protein can cause abnormal small intestinal biopsies that are indistinguishable from celiac disease. however acute viral gastroenteritis is not easily confused with celiac disease because of the difference in the acuteness of symptoms. (acute viral gastroenteritis has a sudden onset of symptoms and last only a few days. ) it is however easier to confuse cow's milk and soy protein allergies with celiac disease but these allergic conditions are rare and primarily occur in young children. despite these limitations small intestinal biopsies are recommended even for individuals who have abnormal antibody tests for celiac disease specific antibody tests for celiac disease antibodies are proteins that are produced by the immune system to fight viruses bacteria and other organisms that infect the body. sometimes however the body produces antibodies against non-infectious substances in the environment (for example in hay fever) and even against its own tissues (autoimmunity). blood tests that are specific for celiac disease include endomysial antibodies anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies and anti-gliadin antibodies. in patients with celiac disease anti-gliadin antibody is an antibody produced against gliadin in the diet and endomysial and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies are antibodies produced against the body's own tissues. endomysial antibodies and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies are highly reliable in diagnosing celiac disease. an individual with abnormally elevated endomysial and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies has a greater than 95% chance of having celiac disease. anti-gliadin antibodies are less reliable and have a high false positive rate. thus a person with an abnormally elevated anti-gliadin antibody level does not necessarily have celiac disease. nevertheless anti-gliadin antibody levels are useful in monitoring the response to treatment because anti-gliadin antibody levels usually begin to fall within several months of successful treatment of celiac disease with a gluten free diet.
yes. trichomoniasis can cause babies to be born early or at a low birth weight (less than 5 pounds). the cdc recommends that women with trichomoniasis who have symptoms should be treated but women without symptoms do not need to be treated. during the first three months of pregnancy many experts feel that women shouldn't take metronidazole (flagyl) because it may hurt the baby. however most doctors feel that metronidazole can be given safely after the end of the first trimester.

cataract development is often equated to looking through a dirty windshield of a car or smearing grease over the lens of a camera. cataracts may cause a variety of complaints and visual changes including blurred vision difficulty with glare (often with bright sun or automobile headlights while driving at night) dull color vision increased nearsightedness accompanied by frequent changes in eyeglass prescription and occasionally double vision in one eye. a change in glasses may help initially once vision begins to change from a cataract; however as the cataract continues to grow vision becomes cloudy and stronger glasses or contact lenses will no longer improve sight. cataracts typically develop gradually and are usually not painful or associated with any eye redness or other symptoms unless they become extremely advanced. rapid and/or painful changes in vision raise suspicion for other eye diseases and should be evaluated by an eye-care professional.
this is an over-dosage but not a toxic or dangerous over-dosage assuming if just was one isolated incident. one needs to be very careful and not exceed recommended dosages of prescription or non-prescription medications. the most likely side effect would be gastrointestinal.

"there is always a chance for an unintentional pregnancy even when you use condoms ""100%"" correctly. i suspect your minor discretion was not serious enough however but i am basing this assumption solely on your description of the act. anytime you have sex. you need to remember that the body is designed to achieve conception not prevent it. perhaps your partner should consider a secondary form of contraception like the birth control pill just in case a more-serious breach of sexual activity occurs like a slipped or broken condom."

sludge is a common term for an abnormality of bile seen with ultrasonography of the gallbladder. specifically the bile within the gallbladder is seen to be of two different densities with the denser bile on the bottom. the bile is denser because it contains microscopic particles usually cholesterol or pigment embedded in mucus. (the mucus is secreted by the gallbladder). over time sludge may remain in the gallbladder it may disappear and not return or it may come and go. these particles may be precursors of gallstones and they occur often in some situations in which gallstones frequently appear for example rapid weight loss pregnancy and with prolonged fasting. nevertheless it appears that sludge goes on to become gallstones in only a minority of people. it is not clear how often  if at all  sludge alone causes problems. sludge has been blamed for many of the same symptoms as gallstones  biliary colic cholecystitis and pancreatitis but often these symptoms and complications are caused by very small gallstones that are missed by ultrasonography. it is also possible that these gallstone-like symptoms and complications are actually caused by small gallstones that have passed through the ducts and into the intestine rather than the sludge itself. thus there is uncertainty about the meaning of sludge. but it is clear that sludge is not the equivalent of gallstones. the practical implication of this uncertainty is that unless someone's symptoms are typical of gallstones sludge should not be considered the cause of the symptoms.
"improvements in diagnosis, staging, surgical techniques, anesthesia, and postoperative care have reduced the short-term death rate for patients who undergo the whippie procedure for pancreatic cancer to less than 4% when the operation is performed at cancer centers by experienced surgeons. at some major centers, the reported death rate is less than 1%. but the rate may still be above 15% in patients who are treated at small hospitals or by less experienced surgeons."

to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia if you have diabetes follow a regular routine of exercising eating your meals and taking your medicines at the same time each day. prolonged or strenuous exercise can cause your body to produce adrenaline and other hormones that can counteract the effects of insulin and cause your blood sugar to rise. if you are participating in strenuous exercise (exercising at your maximum capacity) or prolonged exercise (lasting for several hours or more) your insulin and/or oral diabetic medicine may need to be changed. talk to your health care provider about how to adjust your medicine. be careful exercising when your medicine is reaching its peak effect. depending on the time of exercise reducing your dose of either long-acting insulin or short-acting insulin will be necessary. your doctor can recommend how to make this adjustment. exercise with someone who knows you have diabetes and knows what to do if you have a low blood-sugar reaction. wear a medical identification tag (for example medicalert) or carry an identification card that states you have diabetes. the american diabetes association offers these basic exercise guidelines for those with diabetes: discuss with your doctor what types of exercise might be appropriate for you. complications of diabetes such as severe eye disease and nerve damage may make some forms of exercise dangerous for you. your doctor may also schedule a test to see how your heart responds to exercise. do not exercise if your blood sugar is greater than 250 mg/dl (milligrams per deciliter) and your ketones are positive. this is an indication that you already may have a lack of insulin and exercise will only cause a greater rise in your blood sugar. hydrate yourself and adjust your insulin as necessary contact your health care provider. use caution when exercising if your blood sugar is greater than 300 mg/dl without evidence of ketones. exercise may help decrease your sugars but it's possible they will increase instead. hydrate well prior to and after exercise and keep track of your sugars and ketones. learn the effects of various types of exercise on your blood sugar. have carbohydrate-based foods available for exercise and for the period following exercise. add carbohydrates to your meals if you plan on doing exercise adjust your insulin dose appropriately in anticipation of exercise.
sometimes you can burn more calories when you are asleep than when you are just lying in bed. and it all has to do with our stages of sleep specifically rem sleep. during rem sleep your brain is more active than any other stage. in fact in some cases it is more active than when you are awake. this activity requires fuel for thought called glucose â€“ the basic building block of most foods. in order to sleep better and lose weight: lose the snooze and set your alarm to tell you when to go to bed. use your alarm to help you know when to go bed to get the right amount of quality sleep. dont use the snooze button to potentially interrupt those final minutes of rem sleep! take a quick nap if you are feeling drowsy in the middle of the day. drink one glass of water for every alcoholic beverage you drink and stop all alcohol 3 hours before your bed time alarm goes off. alcohol can help you fall asleep but will keep you out of the deep stages of sleep and rem sleep that you need to avoid sleep deprivation stop exercise four hours before bed. work out earlier in the evening and consider yoga deep breathing or stretching before bed. have your breakfast outside in the morning and get plenty of sunlight to help re-set your internal biological clock. sleep loss affects weight loss â€” from your ability to burn calories to the food choices you make. start with a commitment to sleeping better and you may find yourself a few pounds lighter without changing anything else.
preparation for ultrasound is minimal. generally if internal organs such as the gallbladder are to be examined patients are requested to avoid eating and drinking with the exception of water for six to eight hours prior to the examination. this is because food causes gallbladder contraction minimizing the size which would be visible during the ultrasound. in preparation for examination of the baby and womb during pregnancy it is recommended that mothers drink at least four to six glasses of water approximately one to two hours prior to the examination for the purpose of filling the bladder. the extra fluid in the bladder moves air-filled bowel loops away from the womb so that the baby and womb are more visible during the ultrasound test.
yes but you may not be able to use a tampon unless the radiologist okays it.
hi what is below is from the mayo clinic. implantation bleeding â€” typically defined as bleeding that occurs 10 to 14 days after conception â€” is normal and relatively common. implantation bleeding is thought to happen when the fertilized egg attaches to the lining of the uterus. implantation bleeding usually occurs around the time you would expect to have a menstrual period. however implantation bleeding generally lasts for a short time and is usually much lighter than menstrual bleeding. some women don't experience implantation bleeding and others don't notice it. it's also possible to mistake implantation bleeding for a period. if this happens you might not realize that you're pregnant â€” which can lead to mistakes when determining a baby's due date. implantation bleeding stops on its own and doesn't require treatment. if the bleeding persists or you're concerned about any vaginal bleeding during pregnancy contact your health care provider. so you can see from this its not some kind of right that you get it my wife has had 3 and never got it once if it happens it happens. hope this helps you. good luck

"yes. for example, balance periods of rest and work and rest before you become fatigued. frequent, short rests are beneficial."

"missing one or more menstrual periods is the classic sign of pregnancy. but this can be tricky for teenage girls whose periods aren't yet regular. it can also be tricky for girls whose cycles are off as a result of excessive dieting or exercise or low body fat from sports or anorexia. the full list of pregnancy signs includes: a missed menstrual period nausea or vomiting  called ""morning sickness "" though it can happen throughout the day sudden intense aversion to certain foods especially meats or fatty fried foods sore nipples or breasts unusual fatigue frequent urination unusual mood swings. of course a positive pregnancy test is another sign of pregnancy. today's home pregnancy tests are generally considered accurate. these simple kits can be bought over the counter in drugstores."

"just because a food is ""fast"" doesnt mean it's automatically unhealthy. many quick-service restaurants today offer whole wheat buns grilled chicken cuts salads and reduced-fat dressings on their menus. when eating out avoid fried items and sugary soft drinks. ask for more lettuce tomatoes onions or whatever kinds of veggies the restaurant has. at sub and sandwich places go for lean proteins such as turkey or roast beef. ask for mustard instead of mayo. avoid adding cheese to sandwiches which can contain about 100 calories per slice as well as saturated fats which should be limited for a more heart-healthy diet."
i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. your symptoms definitely deserve to be checked out by your health care provider. any time a person develops a symptom like widespread loss of sensation to a body area it's a good idea to get examined. you can start with your primary care provider or whoever treated your utis. because your uti cleared up over a month ago i wouldn't think your symptom is some weird side effect of antibiotics. and i don't think antiperspirant use would cause loss of sensation either though if you're spraying it directly on your groin area you could try stopping that to see if sensation improves. at any rate i'd recommend you make an appointment with your health care provider for an exam. best wishes to you!

yes. a doctor can take a sample from what appears to be a herpes sore and examine it under a microscope. you can also have a blood test. the blood test looks for antibodies to the virus that your immune system would have made when you were infected. hsv-2 almost always infects the genitals so if antibodies to hsv-2 are detected in your blood you probably have genital herpes. a blood test that shows antibodies to hsv-1 means you could have genital or oral herpes. that's because oral herpes typically caused by hsv-1 can be spread to the genitals during oral sex.
hi. thanks for the query. well you should take the symptoms seriously and consult a neurophysician and get her evaluated and an mri scan can help in diagnosis and then only appropriate treatment can be done. but it needed to be taken into consideration. hope this helps.
hi the penicillin could have upset your vaginal natural balance it will do that because of this you may now have bv (bacterial vaginosis) its just one of these things some women can get can be just the once or can keep re-occurring. so its either of to your doctor for a test and meds or an std/gum clinic they will do the same thing your ok its not an std but the clinic will help you. or you can google bv and sea salt bv and boric acid bv and garlic these are just some ways you can find natural help. now it could be this thats chucking the rest of your body out of sync and giving you the tiredness. as for your miscarriage perhaps a d&c would have helped but you could still have it done now try seeing a doctor or going to a baby clinic that has a doctor there. do hope this helps. good luck

the various medicines used to treat osteoporosis work in different ways. the various medicines used to treat osteoporosis work in different ways. bisphosphonates including drugs like actonel boniva fosamax and reclast work by blocking the effects of certain bone-destroying cells. in this way bisphosphonates can slow down bone loss and lower your risk of fracture. evista is a different sort of medicine called a selective estrogen receptor modulator or serm. it works by mimicking some of the effects of the hormone estrogen which has a beneficial effect on bone mass. other treatments are available. bone is constantly remodeling  old bone is removed by cells called osteoclasts and new bone is laid down by cells called osteoblasts. calcitonin a hormone made within the thyroid gland inhibits bone removal by osteoclasts and promotes bone formation by osteoblasts. forteo a synthetic hormone may also help build bone mass by enhancing the actions of osteoblasts. prolia stops the bone-removing cells before they cause bone loss and is used to treat postmenopausal woman with osteoporosis.
there are lots of things you can do every day to help your body fight these infections or stop them from getting started. basic hygiene works. washing hands before and after going to the bathroom will help as will washing your genital area with mild soap each day. women should always wipe from front to back after voiding and especially after a bowel movement to avoid spreading bacteria from the rectum to the vagina and urethra. drinking enough fluids (6 eight-once glasses each day) and drinking some cranberry juice every day can prevent bacteria from multiplying and causing problems. empty your bladder soon after you feel the urge to go and go at least 4 or 5 times a day. you can make sure your bladder is empty by using your hand to press lightly on the area over your bladder. avoid wearing tight pants and non-cotton underwear. don't use perfumed soaps bubble bath talcum powder or colored toilet paper. know the symptoms of a urinary tract infection and call your doctor or nurse if you start to have any of these symptoms: increased urinary urgency or frequency urinating small amounts sudden unwanted urine leakage feeling that your bladder is not completely empty after voiding any pain or unusual sensation when you void bad-smelling urine fever or chills see blood in your urine or the color of your urine is pink or red.

i wish that i had better news for you. it is a certainty that you did everything you could to help your son before he passed away. and now you are facing the same scary situation again. unfortunately sometimes despite our most valiant efforts to help a sick family member they seem to be on a self-destruct mission and will implode. at 21 years old your grandson is all grown-up and considered a man. you cannot force him to change his reckless lifestyle or to seek professional help. to be honest he seems to heading for either death or prison. here are my recommendations to help with the challenges that he presents to you: do not enable his behavior by giving him money or by helping him to circumvent his personal responsibilities keep yourself physically and emotionally safe. if you feel that danger is in the air by way of your grandson then detach yourself from his life. that may mean having him legally removed from your home having locks changed on your residence calling the police for help or by obtaining a restraining order. sometimes mentally sick individuals (along with their friends) are capable of causing their well meaning family members physical emotional and legal harm. do not blame yourself for his negative life-style. it is not your fault. your grandson will exploit any guilt that you may display. he is most likely morally bankrupt and will rob you of your physical property and health as well as your love for him. i wish you well during this time of uncertainty.
and i'm glad you asked. i think maybe your friend misunderstood what the doctor told her. chlamydia is a very common sexually transmitted infection (sti). you can get chlamydia through vaginal anal or possibly even oral sex. switching from anal sex to vaginal sex in one session may not make you more likely to get chlamydia. however anyone who does have anal sex without a condom before vaginal sex should make sure her partner has thoroughly cleaned his penis. otherwise you could transfer intestinal bacteria (or other types of stis) into the vagina which might not be good. obviously your best bet is always to practice safe sex by having your partner use a condom. it's not perfect because it won't necessarily protect you (or him) from stds like human papillomavirus (hpv) or herpes but it's better than no protection at all. hope this helps!
"i'm sorry to hear you're experiencing this. the good news is it's probably not serious. if this were appendicitis the pain would be on the right side not the left and it would be pretty ouchy. it likely wouldn't be something described as ""mild pain. "" sometimes when a person becomes active as you have they get very in tune with their body  and that can magnify their perception of even minor changes twinges in their state of being. it's not unusual for a person to experience minor aches and pains throughout any given day. it could be you simply never noticed these things before and now you do. another possibility is gas passing through the large intestine or even a piece of hard stool moving along. these situations can produce a mild pain in the left abdominal area. the fatigue and lightheadedness could be mild dehydration or (as you suspected) some sort of fluctuation in your blood sugar levels. if the pain persists or if you develop a fever then you should see a doctor. and by the way keep up the great work with healthy eating and exercising. it sounds like you've really been making an effort. wishing you well!"
there are certainly many different paths that you can take to eat healthy and there is honestly no one right approach. with that said i personally am weary about any diet that is heavily focused on one central theme or ideology. i dont think that its always good to promote only one certain food or completely omit certain food groups altogether. we know that some foods are generally better than others but there is still a lot left to learn. also a healthy diet should be based on a lifestyle change not something that you follow short-term just to promote a certain result. a healthy diet is one that you can sustain long-term and that doesnt leave you feeling hungry or feeling deprived; so overly restrictive diets arent the answer either. lastly a healthy diet is evidence-based and not something formulated on personal claims or anecdotes. a diet that promises you everything is probably too good to be true. if youre looking for more specific examples this site may help: .

any age really. it is helpful to use an antioxidant under your sunscreen and again at night to help prevent wrinkles. the most important antiaging cream you can use is sunscreen every day all year-round even if it is cloudy. damage from sun exposure is cumulative. it is so much easier to prevent wrinkles than it is to fix them afterwards. don't use it by yourself consult with the doctor or expert physician first. because there are many types of brand some are allergic some are having used only chemicals and some are organic. so probably now i think you understand a bit why i'm suggesting you to go to doctor. after all its matter of our skin dear 
"nsaids. otc nsaids can help with pain and inflammation. please try calling a local oral surgeon. most medical offices are open for emergencies only, and this probably falls into that category."

paracetamol is also known as acetaminophen in the united states and is marketed as tylenol along with other product names. anacin is a combination of aspirin and caffeine. both are effective medications and both have potentially harmful side effects. paracetamol can through its breakdown products cause damage to the liver and kidney. generally doses should be kept below four grams per day although some physicians believe that when used chronically the dose should be kept below two grams per day. aspirin's most common side effect is gastric upset and ulceration. it also interferes with blood clotting which is why it is used to help prevent heart disease. with large toxic doses it can cause life-threatening problems with acidosis (excessive acid in the fluids and tissues of the body). a standard maximum daily dosage is six 325 mg pills per day. these drugs can also in large doses cause difficulty with hearing including tinnitus and deafness. you should let your family physician know what you are taking so that he or she can monitor you for side effects and possible drug interactions. in addition you need to be aware of what is in other over-the-counter medications that you take to make sure that they do not have either paracetamol or aspirin in them making your daily intake of these medications higher than you think.

"heart rate reserve your heart beat rises during aerobic exercise. it can rise from 70 beats per minutes (bpm) at rest to as high as 170 bpm or even higher during exercise depending on the intensity of the exercise your fitness level your age and other factors. whether you train aerobically or anaerobically is determined by the intensity of your workout and monitoring the intensity is the key to know if you are working out aerobically. for many individuals simply monitoring how the body feels while exercising is enough to determine the proper aerobic intensity. warm and slightly out of breath"" is a good measure for aerobic activity; that is ask yourself if you feel warm and slightly out of breath while you're exercising and if the answer is ""yes "" then that's good enough. on the other hand some people like to know with more precision how their body is doing during exercise. if that's the case for you then taking your heart rate during exercise and using a target heart rate training zone might be just the ticket. target heart rate zones range anywhere from 50% to 100% of your maximum heart rate (your maximum heart rate is based on your age). aerobic exercise is anything less than 85% and anaerobic exercise is anything above that. a nice starting point for a sedentary individual is somewhere in the range from 50% to 65% (you can always increase as you get more fit) and 65% to 85% for more conditioned individuals. try the heart rate reserve method for calculating a target heart rate. here's the formula and an example of the method for someone 27 years old assuming a resting heart rate of 70 bpm and a training range of 70%. if you plug in other values you can get other ranges. 1. 220-age = max hr. 2. subtract resting heart rate from max hr = heart rate reserve (hrr). 3. multiply hrr times percent you want to train at. 4. add back resting heart rate. assuming a resting heart rate of 70 bpm 27 years old and 70% training range: 220 - 27 = 193 193 - 70 = 123 123 x. 70% = 86 86 + 70 = 156"
hi if you went cold turkey and just stopped smoking then you would find that very stressful so not knowing just how much you smoked lets say its 20 a day? so for the next 20 days cut one out every other day so your now down to ten a day and you feeling good about your self not quite as hard as you thought now cut out the habit smoking over the next week like the one with your first cup of joe the one after breakfast the one after lunch the one after dinner your just doing one a day so after that week your now down to 6 a day and your doing good so over the next week you now cut out 3 more so now you down to three a day and feeling really good about stay on this 3 a day for the next week then at the end of that week say bye bye smokes. but here is the kick in the tail from now on your just between smokes one day at a time when you can get to my daily record which now stands at 17 years plus see this plan worked for me way back in 1996 around march i think. but you must remember smoking is a drug and its so nice to have kicked the habit but there are times when i could kill for a smoke and so will you but be strong and keep it to just between smokes. good luck you will need it and less stressful.

unfortunately you can. genital herpes can end up on your mouth through oral sex for instance. and it is possible for this to happen even when you do not have active lesions. this is the chance that you will both need to take if this was your underlying concern. you have most likely seen many people with cold sores/or fever blisters. these are typically type 1 herpes lesions but you can get type 2 lesions (genital types) on your mouth. with that said you are both actively producing antibodies to suppress the genital outbreaks. theoretically this should limit the spread to other areas but not totally eliminate the possibility. the fact that you both have herpes not at least solves part of the problem. if one of you has active lesions i am sure that sexual activity would not be high on your to-do list at least until you are better. are you both taking suppression drugs? these are daily anti-herpes medicines you can take to limit recurrent outbreaks.

research has shown that with the advent of low-fat foods americans have actually gotten fatter. the truth is that a low-fat or reduced fat food may have the same or more calories than its fully fatted rival. thats because if fat is reduced in a food item sugar is often increased. also seeing the words low-fat or fat free is a green light for many people to overeat. one study showed that people ate 28% more candies if these treats were labeled low-fat instead of regular.  scientists have suggested that people believe that low-fat = low calorie and thus over eat and underestimate the total calories they are consuming. no
any medication including thyroid medications can cause an allergic reaction such as hives. the incidence of hives with thyroid medication though is very low. however there is a known association between hives and thyroid antibodies. about a quarter of patients with long term hives (chronic urticaria) have antibodies to thyroid tissue and many of these patients are found to have low thyroid levels. the patients who had the worst hives were also the ones more likely to have antibodies to thyroid tissue. hives patients can also have antibodies to other immune mediated diseases such as lupus. unfortunately treating the thyroid condition does not eliminate the hives. hello i have hypothyrodism for about 14 yrs now. i am fine taking 150 synthroid. anyways the problem is my son. he is now 36yrs old and was diagnosed with graves about 2yrs ago. he was given the radio active iodine treatment to shut or slow it down. a year later now they started him on synthroid levo armour including others that have been made specially for him but they all cause him to break out in hives and swelling around the face after one or two days. he has seen two allergist since. the first one diluted each and everyone of the meds and injected them in liquid form and sure enough the hives started. he is now off all thyroid meds but very frustrated and feeling all the symthoms of hypo. none of the doctors know what to say or have an answer. and i am frustrated too because i want to help him as i am hypo and don't have any problems like that. please help. if anyone knows about this conditions i have come across many forums about this allergies to meds but again no real answers and they seem to be old 2003 04?
no. frequent orgasms are not harmful but a some point you may need to find a job and some other outside activities. i was with this woman for a few years. she could have an orgasm after a lot of foreplay. after about a year she could have a number of orgasms (10-25) in one evening after about 5 minutes of foreplay. the more orgasms she got the more she wanted and enjoyed them. in her case more was better. hi one thing you have to remember is that a women can multi orgasm with no problem its the one big thing between men and women as us men cant but its nice to see a women enjoying there self's when having sex/making love. so have very many orgasm's wont hurt you did read of a women who enjoyed giving herself many orgasm's a day and still had time for sex. please just enjoy what your getting. good luck

panic attacks are not just an emotional response. if you have ever felt your heart beating very hard it means you have high blood pressure. i know that when i get panic attacks i can't breathe properly and/or i get squeezing headaches. and if you have too much of a food or a certain drink that can also trigger a panic attack. but the best way that i know to stop a panic attack is to either hold your breath for 30 seconds or to just relax yourself and breathe slowly or drink a certain amount of water. best of luck!

it is a little early for most american pediatrician recommendation for whole eggs but since you have already started it and he is doing fine there is really no reason to stop at this point. wheat if tolerated is just fine at age 9 months. at age 12 months he can have just about anything you eat. the rationale in laying different types of foods as children age is to limit the chance of a food intolerance or allergy. wheat and eggs tend to be common allergies. in other parts of the world children are feel traditional diets that defy some of the u. s. recommendations. children in china may be getting tiny amounts of fish (pre-chewed by the mother). in mexico children are often given bean juice (the water from cooked beans). goodness knows what kids in remote areas of africa are eating at this age. nature allows for many variations in diet so don't feel guilty that you jumped the nutritional gun a bit sooner than most. in 12 more weeks nothing really magic is going to happen but then your child can eat nearly all foods.

there are many reasons why you could have stomach pain after eating and nausea. some diagnosis are serious and need medical attention right away. i would schedule an appointment with your doctor asap. be prepared with a complete list of symptoms and see if you can identify potential triggers i. e. certain foods beverages time of day frequency duration etc. the more information you can provide your doctor up front the faster he might be able to give you a diagnosis and treatment. i'm wondering why this appears under ulcer? have you been diagnosed with ulcers before?
i have known people that have used home pregnancy tests that came up negative and went to the doctor and it was positive.
sinusitis and tonsillitis are not technically contagious. exposing someone else will not necessarily give them you exact same disease. it is the germs (bacteria viruses) that can be contagious but exposure to those germs will not necessarily result in the same or any disease since everyone's immune system is different. viruses are the most common pathogens and most respiratory viruses that cause sinusitis or tonsillitis are thought to be transmittable by close contact for a day before you know you are ill and for 2-3 days later. mono is a virus that can cause tonsillitis and mono is contagious for a longer period of time. again exposure does not imply that someone would get anything else by a simple cold. strep can cause both tonsillitis and sinusitis and this bacteria is contagious as long as you are contagious or until the end of your antibiotic course. strep will not just jump out of your throat or nose onto someone else but sharing drinks kissing sneezing in someone's face can certain expose others. if their immune system is susceptible to strep they can certainly get it. sinusitis and tonsilitis are not contagious diseases. so you may not worry of affecting anybody in your close vicinity.
"any woman can get a muffin top. but women are more likely to gain excess belly weight  especially deep inside the belly  as they go through perimenopause and into menopause when their menstrual cycle ends. that's because as estrogen levels drop body fat is redistributed from the hips thighs and buttocks (where it used to be stored as a fuel reserve for breastfeeding) to the abdomen. developing a pooch of subcutaneous (below the skin) fat  what i call the ""menopot""  is perfectly normal. but if you gain more than 2 to 5 pounds it's likely to go deeper into the abdomen creating too much visceral fat. you need some fat in your belly but when it becomes excessive i call it ""toxic fat. "" that's because excessive amounts of visceral fat increase inflammation in the body and ultimately contribute to several conditions including heart disease diabetes and cancer."

your baby either has a cold (viral infection) or is teething. or both. babies often have a difficult time dealing with drainage either saliva or mucous when they are lying flat so a cough is important to clear their airway. coughing can certainly be a sign of something more serious (bronchiolitis rsv pneumonia etc. ) because your baby is immunocompromised due to age so it would be best to have a medical provider listen to those little lungs. there is very little you can do at this age to control a cough but you can make it easier for them to swallow excess mucous by using a cool mist humidifier in the room and sucking out nasal mucous using a special bulb syringe. a drop of saline in each nostril just prior to aspirating it will help loosen any thick mucous.
"the most consistently cited risk factors are: increasing age being overweight and increased number of vaginal deliveries. number of deliveries by c-section does not increase prolapse risk. other associated factors can include irritable bowel syndrome constipation and overall poor health. african-american women are less likely to have symptomatic pelvic prolapse. one small study even found that having a history of stretch marks doubled one's risk for prolapse. ""stretch marks "" you might be thinking ""why would that be? "" the bones of the female pelvis do a great job protecting lower abdominal contents but they do not provide support. the pelvic organs are supported by the muscles in the pelvic floor and the ligaments which can attach from the organs to the bones. it has been theorized that pelvic muscle and ligament strength may be linked to strength of collagen. collagen along with fibrillin is decreased in women with stretch marks."
many antidepressants if not most of them can cause poor libido inability to have an orgasm erectile dysfunction in men etc. when antidepressants increase serotonin in the brain to help depression and anxiety they also increase serotonin in the spinal cord which may disrupt sexual functioning at the same time. this serotonin over-activity may cause sexual problems. unfortunately it is very clear that stopping an antidepressant too quickly will often result in the major depression symptoms coming right back. below are some ideas about how to avoid sexual side effects or treat them if they happen to you. 1) use psychotherapy to treat your depression or anxiety. psychotherapy has no sexual side effects and in many studies is shown to be as effective as medications in helping depression or anxiety. consider a bona fide course of psychotherapy such as cognitive behavioral psychotherapy interpersonal psychotherapy or psychodynamic psychotherapy as these specific types of psychotherapy have well documented outcomes in the treatment of depression and anxiety 2) ask your doctor to choose an antidepressant with less sexual side effect risk. bupropion (wellbutrin) antidepressant products do not manipulate serotonin at all and are considered to be sexual side effect free by many doctors. trazodone (desyrel oleptro) products manipulate serotonin mildly and through a different mechanism and appear to have less sexual side effect problems as well. in treating certain forms of anxiety buspirone (buspar) also is known for producing fewer sexual side effects. 3) if you have to be on a serotonergic antidepressant and develop sexual problems consider asking your doctor for an antidote. almost none of these medications are fda approved for improving sexual functioning however many psychiatrists use them in order to lower sexual side effects while keeping their patient on an effective serotonin antidepressant. patients will have to take two medications at the same time but often two medications may improve depression more substantially and also lower sexual side effects at the same time. erectile dysfunction medications (sildenafil â€” viagra â€” etc. ) may specifically help men and they can be used as well. 4) just bite the bullet. sometimes patients cannot avoid being on serotonin-based antidepressants. these antidotes may not be safe for the individual patient or may not work for the patient. in this case patients will have to decide to have continued good antidepressant effect but suffer sexual side effects or risk discontinuing the antidepressant and a possible relapse into major depression. often times depression is treated from six months to a year with good antidepressant treatment. giving up sexual functioning for a year might be worth keeping the depression away. can you suggest further what the medication antidotes are? i have very resistant depression and must be on ssri (and wellbutrin and trazodone and seroquel) and i wonder what would be a medication for women that would address these side effects? thanks.

"you most definitely should get another urine test /culture. if the lab tests are negative you may not need another course of antibiotics but other causes for your symptom array should be medically-explored by your doctor. before considering ""alternative therapies"" (whatever you were planning) it is best to be properly diagnosed."
times past it was recommended that families with children keep a bottle of ipecac on the shelf in case junior ingested something poisonous. ipecac will reliably cause vomiting about 20-30 minutes after its given so the idea was that you could at least get your child to vomit back the poison. we know now that advice to keep ipecac handy and use it after poisonous ingestions was wrong. though it does cause vomiting that 20-30 minute lag in effectiveness means that in many cases the poison has already been absorbed or has at least traveled beyond the stomach so it cant be brought back up. some ingested things cause as much damage on the way out as when they were eaten and vomiting them will only make things worse. most importantly drinking ipecac will prevent emergency physicians from being able to use truly effective treatments for ingestion such as activated charcoal or medical antidotes. there are current no situations where national poison control centers advice the use of ipecac and the american academy of pediatrics does not recommend parents keep ipecac in their house. if you think someone has ingested something poisonous your best next step is to call the nationwide poison control center at 1-800-222-1222 in the us. try to have the most important information available to discuss: what was ingested when was it ingested who took it and how much was ingested. theyll tell you what steps to take whether you need to go to the er or what to monitor at home.

albuterol is a bronchodilator used typically for asthma and a reactive airway. if the cause of your wife's cough is due to asthma or an allergic disorder then yes it may help. albuterol is not a cough suppressant however. knowing the cause of the cough is always important when determining how to treat it. a cough due to a cold (very common) is from post-nasal drainage so the cough is beneficial since it helps clear the airway. a cough due to allergies can be very irritation so an antihistamine may help. suppressing a cough is considered controversial but often helpful if the cough interferes with sleep. a teaspoon or two of honey can help or if you are looking for an over-the-counter suppressant one containing dextromethorophan (dm) is often helpful. a cough can also be a sign of a lung infection so if any cough persists especially one that is accompanied by chest pain fever or productive of thick mucous should be carefully evaluated by a medical provider. have her drink lots of water and humidify the air she breathes (a cool mist humidifier). all of these things will help quiet a cough.

medical researchers aren't sure exactly how stress increases the risk of heart disease. stress itself might be a risk factor or it could be that high levels of stress make other risk factors (such as high cholesterol or high blood pressure) worse. for example if you are under stress your blood pressure goes up you may overeat you may exercise less and you may be more likely to smoke. if stress itself is a risk factor for heart disease it could be because chronic stress exposes your body to unhealthy persistently elevated levels of stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol. studies also link stress to changes in the way blood clots which increases the risk of heart attack.

actually there are many causes of decreased vision and itching for which you need to rub your eyes. please answer a few questions. since how long you are using glasses? when you had your last refraction? do you have any eye allergy itching watering or redness that get worse in specific season? is this problem persist all day or it is more in the morning or evening? have you got an eye examination or using any drops currently? so from the complaints you described there may be just a change in refraction. if your refraction (glass number) is changing again and again then you might need to get a full eye examination and a few investigations. in cases with repeated change in refraction quickly there are chances of a condition called keratoconus in which shape of the cornea becomes conical and gets thin. at your age the cause of excessive rubbing may be allergic conjunctivitis called vernal keratoconjunctivitis (conjunctivitis due to some seasonal allergy). keratoconus is more common in people who have vernal keratoconjunctivitis. other causes may some congenital corneal dystrophy in which superficial corneal layers are peeled off with mild rubbing and cause blurred vision. so i would advise you to get a complete eye examination and your eye doctor can order some investigations like corneal topography if needed. then further management will depend on the eye examination. revert back with the answers to the above questions to an eye care ophthalmologist online

no this not a medical problem but it could lead to some social embarrassment if your erections are not properly contained in your clothing. there are definitely places where you would not want to sport an erection. unintentional erections are common in adolescents  often these are the boys who refuse to go to the board to work out a math problem in front of the class. later in life young men learn typically how to manage these surprise erections. hi your every woman's dream being able to get back in the game at short notice. what is your life style and do you know what is doing this what is it that is kicking in again to be able to do that? but one thing i would not let it worry you the only time you need to worry is when it stops and that would be the time you wish you knew what was doing it for you in all that time it was working so well. you must have many women on your list unless you a one women guy. all i can say is keep it up take that any way you like. good luck

"inside your abdominal cavity is the long tubular digestive tract. the second part of this tube  the large intestine  is composed of the colon which stretches four to six feet and the rectum which is only four to six inches long. the inner lining of this ""colorectal tube"" can be a fertile breeding ground for small tumors called polyps (figure 1). about a quarter of all adults in the u. s. over the age of 50 will have at least one colorectal polyp. most colorectal cancers develop from polyps in glandular tissue of the intestinal lining. most polyps are benign but at least one type is known to be precancerous. these are called adenomatous polyps. the size of the polyp correlates with the development of cancer. polyps less than 1 cm in size have a slightly greater than a 1% chance of becoming cancer but those 2 cm or greater have a 40% chance of transforming into cancer. overall the incidence is about 5%. most colorectal cancers develop from polyps in glandular tissue of the intestinal lining. if colorectal cancer is diagnosed and treated early while the tumor is still localized the disease is highly curable with five-year survival rates of about 90%. if the tumor continues to grow cancer can spread directly through the bowel wall to surrounding lymph nodes tissues and organs as well as into the bloodstream. once the cancer spreads to lymph nodes or other organs successful treatment becomes more difficult. depending on how advanced the disease is five-year survival rates range from 9% to 93%. cancers of the colon and rectum are the third most common cancer in the u. s. with approximately 150 000 cases diagnosed each year. like many cancers colorectal cancer is of particular concern for people older than age 50. although diagnosis is often possible at an early stage many people delay seeking medical care because they are embarrassed or fearful of symptoms related to their bowels. risk increases significantly after age 50 and continues to increase with age."

"it's probably time to say ""welcome to puberty! "" it sounds like everything is normal to me. when you enter puberty a cascade of hormones begins flooding through your body. these hormones cause you to develop body hair and they also will cause your penis to become larger. the testicles also increase in size. and yes sometimes these things happen with startling quickness. that seems to be the case with you. please don't get into a habit of measuring your penis. every guy on the planet gets worried about his penis size: is it too small? let me tell you there is a wide range of ""normal"" penis sizes. yours sounds within the normal range and it's probably not done developing yet. another thing: eventually years from now you'll be ready to use that penis to have sex. please remember to always practice safe sex. use a condom even if the girl you're with tells you she's on birth control. condoms protect you (and your partner) from a wide variety of sexually transmitted diseases. at 12 years old you're nowhere near ready for sex. but a little information now may help you later right? if you can't talk to your parents about puberty sex and all the physical and emotional changes you're going through try to find a trusted adult (maybe a friend's dad athletic coach pastor or school counselor) to confide in. it's good to talk to someone who can tell you ""everything's going to be ok. "" wishing you well! hi you have a gift look after it as you get older women will just love you. its ok you can put yourself above normal. don't worry your ok. good luck ps just look after it wash it daily and don't forget behind your foreskin its very important that you keep your penis healthy. don't over masturbate if you masturbate use a featherlight touch. just remember your penis is affected by every aspect of your physical mental and emotional life. keep a copy of this last bit it will stand you well. do hope this bit helps you. you are in the midst of puberty so your body will go through some pretty drastic changes. but do not worry. these are all normal. and the average penis size is 6 inches erect so you are well on your way. but down the road a bit you might want to consider using a penis health creme every morning. these help men keep their penis skin healthy clean smooth and irritation-free. this is a big part of sex and intimacy. it's not just about size. i use a creme called man1 man oil and it works great. keep it in mind. good luck to you!"

hi this could be your problem below. achilles tendinopathy is a condition that causes pain swelling and stiffness of the achilles tendon. it is thought to be caused by repeated tiny injuries (known as microtrauma) to the achilles tendon. after each injury the tendon does not heal completely as should normally happen. this means that over time damage to the achilles tendon builds up and achilles tendinopathy can develop. there are a number of things that may lead to these repeated tiny injuries to the achilles tendon. for example: overuse of the achilles tendon. this can be a problem for people who run regularly. (achilles tendinopathy can also be a problem for dancers and for people who play a lot of tennis or other sports that involve jumping. ) training or exercising wearing inappropriate footwear. having poor training or exercising techniques - for example a poor running technique. making a change to your training programme - for example rapidly increasing the intensity of your training and how often you train. training or exercising on hard or sloped surfaces. achilles tendinopathy is also more common in people who have certain types of arthritis such as ankylosing spondylitis or psoriatic arthritis. it is also thought that your genetic 'makeup' (the material inherited from your parents which controls various aspects of your body) may play a part for some people who develop achilles tendinopathy. it is also more common in people who have high blood pressure high cholesterol or diabetes. your find more at www. patient. info/health/achilles tendinopathy just copy ling into google to open and read. do hope this helps you. good luck

inr stands for international normalized ratio. the inr provides some information about a persons bloods tendency to clot (which is often described as how thin or thick their blood is). the inr comes from the conversion of another value the prothrombin time (pt). prothrombin time is the time it takes for blood to clot in a test tube. a high or low pt can suggest bleeding or clotting tendencies. most often the pt is checked to monitor a persons response to blood thinners such as warfarin (coumadin). the problem with prothrombin time testing is that several manufacturers produce and sell slightly different pt tests to laboratories. the same persons blood might have different results if tested on two different companies pt tests. to solve this problem the international normalized ratio (inr) was created. by entering a pt result into a math formula it yields the inr. the international normalized ratio means one labs test results can be compared to anothers with high accuracy. a normal inr is approximately 1. 0. people taking the blood thinner warfarin typically have a target inr of 2. 0 to 3. 0. people with an inr higher than the normal range who arent taking warfarin may have a medical condition that needs further evaluation. a low inr is rarely significant.
"the body including the liver has a remarkable ability to repair itself that is to a certain extent. minor damage for infections can often be repaired but severe liver damage. never. this is why some people end up with liver transplants. so to say that ""all types of liver disease"" can be repaired over time is really unrealistic."

if your urine is cloudy and then clears up later in the day and you have no other symptoms you probably have nothing to worry about. eating a large meal or drinking lots of milk can cause urine to be cloudy temporarily. women may also have a small amount of vaginal discharge mixing with urine that makes it look a little cloudyâ€”this is also usually not a problem so do not worry. if cloudiness persists and you have other symptomsâ€”pain and burning during urination a feeling of urgency or even fever for exampleâ€”you need to talk to your primary care provider about it as you may have a urinary tract infection or other condition requiring treatment. if your urine is dark amber in color and has a strong odor too it may indicate that it's extremely concentrated. this can happen after heavy exercise and sweating and means that you need to drink more water to avoid dehydration. if the extra water intake doesn't lighten the color and odor of your urine you may have other conditions that require medical attention such as a urinary tract infection or even early diabetes. sometimes foods cause urine to have an odor (asparagus for example) but the odor should go away after a few hours or overnight. if a strong odor persists it's time to contact your health care provider and have a urine test to determine the cause.
"you should be ejaculating. since you are not and i am assuming that you have never ejaculated in three years during masturbation there could be a problem. one possibility is ""retrograde ejaculation"" - a condition where the semen is ejaculated backwards into your urinary bladder and not out of your urethra. there are other possibilities of course but this cannot be solved on-line. this may not be an issue that can be solved by a your primary care provider so i suggest that you see a urologist."

hi first if you have not got over this problem yet seeing as this was now 8 months ago. does your wife know about your excess masturbating one thing you should get off your chest with your wife by telling her the facts. to start with for over masturbation you need to start an 8 week break from masturbating and any sexual contact with the wife now depending just how bad you problem is it may take another 4 to 8 weeks by doing this you will be rebooting your body and it starts self healing. if you watch porn? now is the time to get rid of it clear your computer or sites clear away any down loads and last throw away any discs get the wife to install an child porn lock she keeps the pass word. now you will know when this starts working as you will get you nocturnal erections back along with your morning woods when these start to happen its working but you need to wait still just let things get better by doing the 8 12 or 16 weeks as for your pe there is an exercise for this its called edging to find this just google pegym look under exercises and take it from there. do hope this helps you. good luck
"it's perfectly normal for a person's pulse and blood pressure to rise when they walk or run. this happens because the heart must pump more blood  faster  to serve oxygen to the body's tissues. in fact the whole purpose of ""aerobic"" activity like walking is to increase the heart rate. and if a person is ""out of shape"" (that is they are moving from a very sedentary lifestyle to a more active one) the rise in pulse rate and blood pressure is likely to occur more quickly than it would in someone whose body is used to physical activity. that said it's always a good idea to consult your doctor before starting any exercise program. i suspect your mother's primary care provider will clear her for an easy exercise program such as walking but it's better to check with the doctor first. i hate to dissuade anyone from walking because it's normally a harmless activity and a pulse of 140 isn't necessarily ""bad"" (in fact a pulse of 140 is lower than my own target heart rate ) but i cannot give medical advice. and so my suggestion is for your mother to check with her doctor to make sure walking is ok for exercise purposes. in general walking is among the safest and most effective ways to lose weight and get the heart (cardiovascular) system into shape. walking even for short periods of time or for short distances (to start) can be a good way to build up to more exertion such as jogging. wishing you well!"

carbohydrates such as whole-grain breads cereals pastas and brown rice provide the energy needed to fuel a workout that is designed to tone your body. proper nutrition is important for resistance training and weight and strength training. maintaining good eating habits can improve your overall performance and increase muscle strength. this is true whether you lift weights once a week or multiple times a day. people who perform a great deal of resistance training need a diet that includes carbohydrates for energy and moderate amounts of fat and protein. you can easily meet these needs with a nutrient-dense well-balanced diet.

"nearly 50 000 americans are diagnosed with parkinson's disease each year but getting an accurate count of the number of cases may be impossible because many people in the early stages of the disease assume their symptoms are the result of normal aging and do not seek help from a physician. also diagnosis is sometimes difficult and uncertain because other conditions may produce symptoms of parkinson's disease and there is no definitive test for the disease. people with parkinson's disease may sometimes be told by their doctors that they have other disorders and people with parkinson's disease-like diseases may be incorrectly diagnosed as having parkinson's disease. parkinson's disease strikes about 50% more men than women but the reasons for this discrepancy are unclear. while it occurs in people throughout the world a number of studies have found a higher incidence in developed countries possibly because of increased exposure to pesticides or other toxins in those countries. other studies have found an increased risk in people who live in rural areas and in those who work in certain professions although the studies to date are not conclusive and the reasons for the apparent risks are not clear. one clear risk factor for parkinson's disease is age. the average age of onset is 60 years and the incidence rises significantly with increasing age. however about 5% to 10% of people with parkinson's disease have ""early onset"" disease that begins before the age of 50. early onset forms of the disease are often inherited though not always and some have been linked to specific gene mutations. people with one or more close relatives who have parkinson's disease have an increased risk of developing the disease themselves but the total risk is still just 2%-5% unless the family has a known gene mutation for the disease. an estimated 15%-25% of people with parkinson's disease have a known relative with the disease. in very rare cases parkinsonian symptoms may appear in people before the age of 20. this condition is called juvenile parkinsonism. it is most commonly seen in japan but has been found in other countries as well. it usually begins with dystonia and bradykinesia and the symptoms often improve with levodopa medication. juvenile parkinsonism often runs in families and is sometimes linked to a mutated parkin gene."
it may very well be that you won't find a health plan you can afford especially if you don't qualify for a subsidy. however i would highly recommend you speak with a licensed insurance agent in your area for help before the deadline. first if you don't qualify for a subsidy you can shop outside of your state's marketplace to find a wider range of options some of which might better meet your needs. and a good agent has a very deep understanding of the plans in your area. i have known many people who thought they couldn't afford coverage and then worked with a professional who was able to find them something they could afford. of course there are no guarantees but do yourself a favor and at least give it a shot before open enrollment closes. here's a website where you can find a licensed agent in your area:  good luck!

hi. u seem to have had sex in the most vulnerable period of ovulation and the fact that you are 4 weeks late on depo goes more in favour of pregnancy. side effects of depo due to hormonal changes are somewhat similar as well. but i suggest you get a pregnancy test done to confirm. consult a gynecologist if u have no relief in 2 days. thanks
benadryl is an antihistamine; it should not cause congestion per se but it can dry out mucous membranes and make a persion tired.
there is always a possibility but based on what you have shared the chances are certainly less since (a) there was no ejaculate (b) you immediately stopped intercourse and (c) you may not have been ovulating. you can take plan b if you want but it should to be taken within 24 hours to be most effective. condoms are not perfect of course so if you are having sex often you may want to consider adding oral contraceptives as well as those condoms. just in case. sometimes with our best precautions an unintentional pregnancy can happen. hopefully it will not this time. obviously if you miss a period or have signs of an early pregnancy take a home pregnancy test.

if you feel that your bladder never completely empties this is a good reason on its own to see your medical provider. even if you'd had this evaluated in the past it's worth continuing to try to find out what's causing your symptoms especially now that you're seeing particulates in your urine. your health care provider undoubtedly will want a urine specimen when you go in for your visit so be sure not to empty your bladder right before your appointment. your provider also may want to know about other symptoms you may be experiencing such as fever sweats chills and so on. he or she also may want details about your diet so be prepared to provide plenty of information about what you eat and drink. in fact you might keep a log of everything you eat and drink in the week before your appointment. all of this information will give your medical provider clues about what might be causing your symptoms. while it's unlikely your symptoms are caused by any serious illness i'd suggest you make an appointment with your provider as soon as possible. it sounds like the situation has been going on for some time and you deserve to get some answers. wishing you all the best!
"i know you believe the problem is sinus drainage but has anyone evaluated you for acid reflux? i mention this because people (especially those with sinus problems) often believe they are constantly coughing up nasal drainage when actually they're coughing up stomach acid. you can test this theory yourself by taking an over-the-counter antacid for a few days to see if it helps the problem. a lot of people aren't aware stomach acid can move all the way up the esophagus into the posterior portion of the mouth (especially when sleeping). sometimes acid reflux is actually diagnosed by a dentist who notices substantial erosion of the molars caused by stomach acid. if the antacid helps or if you can correlate a pattern of ""phlegm"" with food intake you might take up the acid reflux idea with your health care provider during your next visit. wishing you well!"
hi it is quite possible to have both at the same time but this swelling could be just from your urine as it pass's over your vaginal lips. but also being on antibiotics this could give you a yi as this upsets your natural vaginal ph so after one night it could be that but its toss a coin time to what it really could be having both. but if you don't want to take any more drugs try these its all natural ways of clearing away a yi.    just copy into google one at a time to the www. to open and read. do hope these help you. good luck
yes different foods cooked in the same oil could result in cross-contamination as traces of the allergenic proteins may be left behind in the oil. cross-contamination can also occur on cutting boards grills and cooking vessels and utensils that are re-used without cleaning. when eating out at restaurants its important that you be vocal and communicate your allergies with your waiter/waitress so that the cook/chef can make the appropriate accommodations when preparing your food. even if you dont think that the food that youre ordering contains any of your allergens its better to have them check before you consume it to avoid further incidents. it will be important to mention that you have an allergy regardless so that you can be assured that proper food handling techniques are used and that there will be no cross-contamination. i would also suggest keeping a food journal so that you can better identify your triggers and gain a better understanding of your reaction to certain foods. in the case of severe anaphylaxis your doctor may equip you with an epipen so that youre able to stop allergic reactions fast any contact with a food you are allergic to can cause an allergic reaction. best advice: if you're allergic to shellfish never eat somewhere that serves it. lobster is a shellfish and peanuts are in snickers. stay far away from things you're allergic to and talk to your doctor about an epi-pen.

"normal 0 false false false microsoftinternetexplorer4 hopefully you have started the anti-yeast creams (monistat lotrimin micatin etc. or a store-brand generic) by now. this will manage the yeast in a few days but you will still have inflammation. a ""trick"" that i use for my little patients is to mix the yeast medication with an equal amount of hydrocortisone cream to help the redness and inflammation. put in on the diaper area at least 3-4 times per day. once this medication is rubbed in put a barrier cream or ointment over the top  something like plain 'ol vaseline. air-out the diaper area as much as you can. after a bowel movement you may need to put the in the bathtub or shower to make sure you get off all of the stool residual (this can burn the skin. bad diaper rashes can also predispose the child to a secondary bacterial infection so if the skin is breaking down or bleeding you will need to contact her medical provider to see if an oral antibiotic would be appropriate. aw i'm sorry your baby is going through this. uncomfortable is right! i'm not sure why you believe this diaper rash has turned to a yeast infection but i bow to your wisdom as the parent. (smile) i don't have a lot to offer but i can tell you that regular old cornstarch (available at the grocery store near the flour) can help dry out the rash and it's safe even for baby girls (with all those delicate skin folds). in fact since it doesn't contain perfume it's a good choice for diaper rash in little girls. if it's possible to dry out your baby's bottom by leaving the diaper off altogether for periods of time that's helpful too. whatever you do please do not use any over-the-counter (otc) yeast infection medications on your baby. she may be uncomfortable but she'll survive until you get a diagnosis from a health care professional. i hope this helps a little bit!"

"the symptoms and the course of parkinson's disease can vary a great deal from person to person. there is no known cure for parkinson's disease. however drugs surgery exercise and lifestyle changes can relieve some symptoms of the disease. emotions may also affect symptoms. anxiety tension and unhappiness may make symptoms worse. relaxing usually reduces symptoms. sometimes during stress a person with parkinson's disease has a ""paradoxical outburst. "" this results in a short symptom-free period when the person may be able to move normally. treatment may help control symptoms during the early stages of parkinson's disease and is usually started as soon as symptoms begin to affect a person's ability to work or do daily activities. for instance a right-handed person with tremor only on the left side may not feel limited by the symptoms and may not feel the need to take drugs until symptoms get worse. a person who cannot do his or her job because of symptoms may want to begin treatment sooner than someone who does not work or whose symptoms do not affect his or her ability to work. symptoms of parkinson's disease typically begin appearing between the ages 50 and 60. they develop slowly and often go unnoticed by family friends and even the person who has them. a small number of people have symptoms on only one side of the body that never progress to the other side. drugs can control symptoms to some extent but as the disease progresses drugs may become less effective. parkinson's disease also can cause a variety of complications as it advances. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

syrup of ipecac is a product that was approved by the fda some years ago to help induce vomiting. for a while it was a very common thing to be found in like baby baskets that you should always have it around the house. over the past few years though recently that's kind of changed and syrup of ipecac is actually not recommended anymore. the american academy of pediatrics has actually withdrawn it from their list of recommended products to have around children. so if there are any type of concerns call you poison control number they will walk you through the process. you will probably have to call for emergency help 911 as well just to go to the hospital to make sure everything is okay. but it is not a product that is recommended anymore.

hi a clear watery discharge from the vagina usually occurs when the cells of the cervix undergo certain changes known as cervical erosion. this is not a malignant or premalignant condition and usually occurs in response to estrogen or infection. since you are in permenopause the estrogen level is likely to be low. but what could be causing the discharge is a condition known as atrophic vaginitis or postmenopausal vaginitis together with cervical erosion. this condition usually occurs when the vaginal walls thin out due to low estrogen level. a reactive inflammation sets in in both the cerix and the vagina and you may get the thin clear discharge which you now have. i do hope this helps you. good luck

when a tooth is properly extracted a graft is mostly not necessary. the healing time is: six to 8 weeks after extraction the implant can be placed. the implant (depending on the brand type bone etc. ) will integrate in 2-4 months. at that point a crown restoration can be fabricated in 1-2 weeks (from impression to finish). usually an uncomplicated implant placement will take about 4-6 months from extraction to delivery of the final crown. complications such as bone deficiencies are common enough but not the norm.

well i have to say when the whi study came out in 2002 it was insane what they did with this research and how they presented it to women. i remember i was dealing with webmd at that point and coming on line and talking to all the women and telling them not to stop their hormones if anything to switch over to the natural progesterone. but what had happened was the study was really done on synthetic hormones and women who started 10 years after the fact always my recommendation to women when they go on hormone replacement therapy they do it around the perimenopause when they are having the maximum symptoms that they take it for menopausal symptoms and they take the least amount they need to control their symptoms and for the shortest amount of time that they need to take it so that they are not getting into twenty years down the line of continuous hormonal replacement therapy and getting into trouble with breast cancer.

"""the stomach carries the heart and not the heart the stomach. ""  miguel de cervantes i think that cervantes had it about half right. it's true that what we eat directly impacts our heart health. but we also rely on a healthy heart to enjoy life's pleasures which should definitely include eating good foods. how we shop and prepare our food makes a huge impact on our health. so what can you do to make sure you're on the right track? here are three tips to get you started. 1. clean out your pantry. do it today and try it at least once a month. go through your fridge and even that old freezer in the garage too. take stock of what you've got and what you don't need. focus on purging processed foods foods with trans fats and food products that contain high fructose corn syrup. while throwing away food of any type is less than ideal it's important to recognize that most of these products aren't real food anyway. get rid of them and start fresh next time you go shopping. 2. read food labels. think of reading food labels as having a free dietitian at your disposal. first determine what the actual serving size of your food item is supposed to be. you might be amazed to learn that you have been drinking two servings of your favorite soda in one bottle or that the bowl of cereal you usually pour for yourself was meant for three. second look at the trans fats listing. it should read zero. next look for fancy lingo on your label. a good example is ""partially hydrogenated "" which is a term that companies use sometimes to sneak small amounts of trans fats into their products. finally look for foods low in sodium. it turns out that processed foods provide about 80% of the sodium in our diets. you can make a great improvement in your diet by choosing low-sodium or sodium-free options. 3. outsmart the supermarket. when grocery shopping have you ever wondered why you could never find a decent tomato? but it's so easy to find candy bars frozen pizzas and even tabloid magazines. it's called ""market research. "" supermarkets understand all too well how their customers walk through stores and how this can impact their buying habits. we tend to start our shopping on the right side of the store swing around the back and then head toward the checkout line through the middle. this is why so many cheap (""cheap"" from the supermarket's perspective) convenience foods are in the center aisle and the candy is prominently displayed as you swipe your credit card. it can be harder to find some of the healthier foods that have a lower profit margin. the solution is to attentively shop from a list and to avoid any impulse purchases. people don't tend to buy quinoa and steel-cut oats when they're in a hurry. eat fruits and vegatables and you should try to get good nutriants"
hi. it seems to be a hair follicle infection or a sebaceous cyst. these usually are symptomless and wont cause any harm in long run unless they grow bigger in size. apply olive oil or aloevera oil daily before sleeping. do not press it. if the size grows bigger or if it starts hurting then consult a doctor. thanks
let me ask you how your little girl get relieved from the nausea or the headache? what makes it worse? i also recommend her to do visual acuity test v soon
hi done some very quick research on an idea just google these. does nicotine cause bv does nicotine cause yeast infections now under this last one found you this but most of the info is from smoking.  tobacco use when caused by the use of tobacco yeast infections can occur in anyone. the reason that tobacco use increases the risk of oral thrush is that it alters the chemistry of your mouth allowing the candida bacteria to move into a position of power. your mouth is already a prime area as far as candida is concerned because in is generally both warm and moist. the skin in some parts of your mouth is also very thin allowing candida better access to the supplies of nutrients hidden just below the surface. generally your helper bacteria and immune system can stave off candida infection but if you do something like chew tobacco smoke or just generally practice poor dental hygiene you could be helping to swing the balance in the direction of the bacteria. if you have dentures you are at a particularly high risk of developing oral thrush particularly if the dentures dont fit well and if you also use tobacco yeast infections are very likely to develop. perhaps this will help better. good luck
without insurance you can consider using an urgent care center in your neighborhood to have your condition checked out. you'll generally pay a flat rate for the care you receive. it doesn't replace a relationship with a doctor which you may need if you have a health condition that requires on-going care but at least you can get some idea as to what's going on. without insurance you can consider using an urgent care center in your neighborhood to have your condition checked out. you'll generally pay a flat rate for the care you receive. it doesn't replace a relationship with a doctor which you may need if you have a health condition that requires on-going care but at least you can get some idea as to what's going on.
assuming that you do indeed have the flu now (lab confirmed influenza) this would not be uncommon. this years flu strain (i don't know which vaccine you received) is only about 50% protective so you can still get influenza (hopefully a milder case than if you were not immunized) since the flu virus has changed (this occasionally happens). you are never contagious from the flu vaccine of course but if you truly have influenza now you were contagious about a day before you knew you had the flu and several days to a week after you get influenza. children may be contagious for a longer period.
aids is the final stage of hiv infection. when the immune system cd4 cells drop to a very low level a person's ability to fight infection is lost. in addition there are several conditions that occur in people with hiv infection with this degree of immune system failure; these are called aids-defining illnesses. according to the cdc 1 051 875 people in the u. s. have been diagnosed with aids since the disease was first diagnosed in 1981. they also estimate that 583 298 have died from the disease in the u. s.
one thing to examine is the chemical attraction. is this still at pretty much the same levels as when this relationship started or has it deteriorated too? new post marriage annoying personality physical and/or behavioral discoveries could impact chemical attraction and lead to difficiencies in otherwise perfectly normal individuals. you may want to in addition to testing your t levels re-assess that side of the relationship.
i am very sorry but without a hands-on examination and a detailed medical history it would not be possible to blindly offer you a definite diagnosis determine if this mass was cancer and suggest a treatment. in order for you to be properly diagnosed i would suggest that you see a surgeon. someone who can examine this mass perhaps do a biopsy and address this ten-year old problem.
hi the watery diarrhoea seems to be due to either gut infection or due to side effect of the malarial drug. give pre / probiotic tablets. avoid milk and oily products. blank coffe will help. give plenty of fluids and fruit juices. try stopping malarial if its recommended. thanks
bacterial and viral infections have many similarities. both types of infections are caused by microbes  bacteria and viruses respectively  and spread by routes such as: coughing and sneezing. contact with contaminated people especially through activities such as kissing and sexual intercourse. contact with contaminated surfaces food and water. contact with contaminated creatures including household pets livestock and insects such as fleas and ticks. microbes can also cause: acute infections which are short-lived. chronic infections which can last for weeks months or a lifetime. latent infections which may not initially cause symptoms but which can reactivate over a period of months and years. most importantly bacterial and viral infections  which are defined as an invasion of microbes able to reproduce in the body  can cause mild moderate and severe disease. throughout history millions of people have succumbed to diseases such as bubonic plague or the black death which is caused by the yersinia pestis bacterium and smallpox which is caused by the variola virus. in recent times viral infections have been responsible for two major pandemics: the 1918-1919 spanish flu epidemic that killed 20-40 million people and the ongoing hiv/aids epidemic that killed an estimated 2 million people worldwide in 2008 alone. bacterial and viral infections can cause similar symptoms such as coughing and sneezing fever inflammation vomiting diarrhea fatigue and cramping  all of which are ways the immune system tries to rid the body of infectious organisms. but bacterial and viral infections are dissimilar in many other important respects most of them due to the organisms' structural differences and the way they respond to currently available antimicrobial medications.
the next step would be to see a gastoenterlogist - someone that can visually inspect your stomach with a fiberoptic scope or at least run some additional diagnostic tests. medications used to block or reduce your stomach acid or an antispasmotic medication taken prior to meals would be one treatment consideration once you are properly diagnosed. i am having the same problem. my stomach is so tender and sore. i have excruciating pain. i have had a lot of test and all the doctors said was gastritis and colitis. i am not taking any medication for this and just wondering what i should do. i can't live in this kind of pain. there should be some kind of cure for this. i don't have diarrhea or sick stomach. i had a lot of stomach issues i was diagnosed with h pylori it is a bacterial infection in the stomach my gastroenterologist did a breathing test to find that i had a very severe case this was after 3 ct scans an endoscope and a colonoscopy! ask your doctor about diverticulitis.

"i can't answer that question since i would need to know what ""it"" actually was. i cannot make a blind guess and determine if ""it"" will go away. i am very sorry. there are many things that cause intrascotal masses. a brief description of the size and location does not really substitute for a thorough examination. i realize that money may be tight and that you do not have insurance but there are really no alternatives. you will need to make a decision based on how concerned you are about this new finding. give your husband the same consideration as your automobile. if your car was causing problems or making a strange noise you would get it checked out before it became worse."
twenty percent to 50% of travelers may develop diarrhea depending on the region of the world they visit. diarrhea is the most common illness of travelers. in general travelers at risk for diarrhea commonly come from industrialized nations and travel to high-risk areas that are primarily within developing or less industrialized nations of the world including latin america africa the middle east and asia. areas of lesser risk include china and some caribbean nations. travel to areas of the u. s. canada northern europe and australia pose the lowest risk to travelers. men and women are at equal risk for developing travelers' diarrhea. younger individuals are more commonly afflicted perhaps because of more adventurous eating habits. people with disorders that compromise their immune system (such as hiv cancer chemotherapy steroid use) diabetes patients and people with underlying abdominal disorders (irritable bowel syndrome colitis) are more susceptible to travelers' diarrhea. interestingly people on acid blockers for their stomachs  such as famotidine (pepcid) cimetidine (tagamet) omeprazole (prilosec) and esomeprazole (nexium)  also have a higher susceptibility to travelers' diarrhea because they have less stomach acid to protect them from the bacteria that cause the condition.
bed bugs are small oval non-flying insects that belong to the insect family cimicidae which includes three species that bite people. adult bed bugs reach 5-7 mm in length while nymphs (juveniles) are as small as 1. 5 mm. bed bugs have flat bodies and may sometimes be mistaken for ticks or small cockroaches. bed bugs feed by sucking blood from humans or animals. adult bed bugs are reddish brown in color appearing more reddish after feeding on a blood meal. nymphs are clear in color and appear bright red after feeding. the wings of bed bugs are vestigial so they cannot fly.
sounds like typical diarrhea to me. you should maybe revel in the fact that it's just once a year? you might want to try and think through what you ate or drank when this happened in the past and stay away from those things. if it totally makes you sad you should talk to your doctor.

"i'm sorry to hear you feel you're being ignored by the medical professionals who are treating you. that's not good. sometimes a person has to be very vocal in telling their health care provider what they want done  and why. if you feel your complaints of chronic back pain have been ignored perhaps this would be a good time for you to tell your doctor straight out that you want some testing done on your back to figure out what is causing the pain. it can be helpful to take a trusted family member or friend with you on these appointments. this person can act as an ""advocate "" or a person who will take up your cause with you. your advocate should have a pen and some paper to take notes and he or she should feel free to ask questions. i hope this approach will get you the results you want!"
unfortunately i have no way of determining if the conditioner might be the cause since i do not know what you are using and of course i have no way of examining the sores on your scalp. you have two options: see your primary care provider or see a dermatologist. take the conditioner with you to that visit. my choice would be the dermatologist since they are skin experts and may be able to solve this chronic scalp problem.

it sounds like you have your work cut out for you! but the good news is that there are many good-tasting healthy foods that will fit the bill. you should start with some good basic gluten free recipes-like the ones found in our gluten-free recipes directory. look them over and pick the ones that do not contain meat. and start cooking! there are many types of vegetarian dietsâ€”ones that include eggs and dairy â€“or vegan options that do not include any animal products at all. if you choose ovo-lacto (eggs and dairy) vegetarianism just be sure to use only low-fat dairy in your cooking. eggs can be part of a healthy low fat dietâ€”just dont go overboard. it is the yolk that has the cholesterol. so switch to the egg whites whenever you can. and you can use olive oil as a healthier alternative to the animal fats. if you are changing your diet because of health issues such as heart disease diabetes celiac disease or high cholesterol talk to a dietitian. they are a wealth of information. many insurance companies will even help cover the visit. detailed information about a gluten-free diet is also available at the celiac disease foundation website  also make sure you talk to your doctor before starting any new diet. there are several recipes that can be found on the webmd website. i have included links to gluten free recipes and vegetarian recipes. when looking at the ingredients of a recipe feel free to alter to fit within your diet regimen. i have also included a link about the tlc diet (therapeutic lifestyle changes) to help you choose foods that are lower in cholesterol.
tight pants can rub on sensitive skin. if the skin is irritated it becomes more prone to an infection from surface bacteria. a boil can be staph so this should be promptly treated. you may find looser jeans more comfortable until this boil resolves.
currently there are no drug interactions found between levothyroxine and omeprazole. however this does not mean that interactions cannot exist. it is important to work with your pharmacist to see if there is any new information regarding these two products. omeprazole should be taken 30 minutes prior to a meal. levothyroxine should be taken 30 minutes to one hour prior to a meal. they can be taken together with water on an empty stomach if needed. the previous answer is not only false but can lead to very serious health implications. co-administration of omeprazole/other ppis/acid reducers/etc. along with thyroid meds (whether for tsh t4 or others) can cause a drastic decrease in absorption of the thyroid medication. there are many peer reviewed studies that prove this all one needs to do is a proper google search or a subscription to any of the popular medical journals. your stomach needs an acidic environment to properly convert your thyroid medication into a usable medication to get into your bloodstream and if you take an acid reducer with your thyroid med this can cause problems. if you must take both (as i personally do because of my tsh levels reaching 24. 6 plus ulcers and cancerous polyps due to gerd) make sure you take your acid reducing medication at least 4 hours before your thyroid medication (no matter what kind it is) and make sure not to take another acid reducing medication at least 4 hours after your thyroid med. if you do not separate the acid reducers 4 hours before and 4 hours after your thyroid medication your thyroid levels will become unstable and you will need to adjust your dosage. but in order to prevent your levels from getting out of whack and potentially causing more harm just separate your meds as posted above and you should have no issue. the above answer telling you that it is okay to take at the same time is incredibly harmful. don't take my word for it (someone who has been dealing with both issues for a decade) trust the scientists that have figured this out through multiple peer reviewed studies. just a few sources proving the point of my previous answer after 2 minutes of google searches (wow was that previous post really posted by a doctor? i feel bad for their patients):    
currently most practitioners will not initiate an extensive medical evaluation for a single pregnancy loss since the chance of having a normal pregnancy subsequent to even two consecutive miscarriages is 80% to 90%. for women with recurrent pregnancy loss an evaluation will focus on the pattern and history of the prior miscarriages. three consecutive miscarriages would suggest a woman should receive further evaluation. thus the following tests are considered for women with three consecutive miscarriages. blood testing can be ordered to identify chromosomal abnormalities in the couple that could be transmitted to the fetus. the couple can each appear completely normal but still carry chromosomal defects which when combined can be lethal to the embryo. this type of testing is called karyotyping and it is performed on both members of the couple. a hysterosalpingogram (hsg) can identify anatomical abnormalities within the uterus. antinuclear antibody anticardiolipin antibody vdrl rpr and lupus anticoagulant are some of the blood tests used to diagnose autoimmune diseases that can cause recurrent miscarriage. as described above some of these illnesses will already by apparent to the woman and her doctor but not all cases. other antibody tests may be performed as well.
"if left untreated, chlamydia infection in women can cause pelvic inflammatory disease, which can damage the fallopian tubes or even cause infertility. untreated chlamydia infection could also increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy. it may cause premature births and the infection can be passed along from the mother to their child during childbirth, causing an eye infection, blindness, or pneumonia in the newborn."
"i am sorry but there isn't any way around my answering this question without injecting some medical terms into the discussion. the sense of smell is referred to in medical terminology as the olfactory system. what you are describing in your question is called olfactory hallucinations. in the medical community the technical name for olfactory hallucinations is called ""phantosmia"" (probably derived from phantom). phantosmia can present itself in a very real manner. suffers smell an odor like smoke (or some other odor) and may even experience a gaging sensation. in actually there is really no smoke or environmental cause supporting that reaction. phantosmia can be caused by some serious medical conditions that require discussion and investigation with a doctor. these may include brain damage caused by tumors or trauma epilepsy and infectious damage to the olfactory. system."
the only way to know for certain whether the particular therapy your doctor is prescribing will be covered by insurance is to check with your insurer directly. it's probably best to get your doctor's office involved here to make sure the specifics of the treatment are clearly communicated to avoid surprise bills down the line.
no you do not still ovulate after conception. the point of ovulation is to release a fresh egg for fertilization. as you already have a very ripe and fertilized egg there is no need for this.
please take no disrespect when i say many men your age would envy your statement! this morning erection probably means nothing medically. if it concerns you i'd suggest making an appointment with your primary health care provider. it's possible though doubtful this could be a sign of high blood pressure. you probably would not be classified as having ed (erectile dysfunction). usually ed refers to being unable to keep and maintain an erection. if this is the case (you can't achieve an erection when you want to) then by all means see your medical provider to discuss the problem and get treatment. these issues usually are easily treatable today. i wish you all the best!
hi. yes you should consult an endocrinologist as these results are abnormal. that would be an endocrine disorder that needs further investigations and follow ups directly with a specialist to rule out the problem regards
hi euthyrox and dostinex are perfect for your infertility i recommend starting them as soon as possible good luck
while it is best to keep augmentin refrigerated at all times to maintain efficacy i am uncertain as to whether or not the efficacy was compromised because it was left out of the refrigerator all night. it does not become dangerous to use after it has been left out of the refrigerator. but it may not work to cure your son's infection and could prolong his illness. to be on the safe side i would suggest getting a new prescription. without knowing anything else about your son's situation i would say that is the way to ensure he continues to get the most effective form of the medication.
you should just take the tylenol like your doctor suggested. medications like ibuprofen and aleve all have the potential of causing bleeding (just like aspirin). there is nothing over the counter. if you need something stronger than tylenol you will need to contact your medical provider for a prescription; perhaps one that has codeine.
knowing where to get support can go a long way toward managing the emotional and financial strain that comes with caring for a loved one who is sick or frail. legal and financial planning: make sure you've put in place important documents designed to protect you and your loved ones from legal and financial troubles. read more about that here. get help: at some point most caretakers need help caring for their loved one. there's a wealth of information available about home care caregiver support and transportation among other services. here are some resources: the department of health and human services' eldercare locator. the alzheimer's association the national institute on aging's alzheimer's disease education and referral center the family caregiver alliance's family care navigator which offers state-by-state lists of resources for a wide range of needs nursing home compare provides detailed information about nursing homes across the country find support: most family caregivers suffer from their own health issues and that more than half have trouble falling or staying asleep due to stress. caring for yourself is equally as important as taking care of someone you love. although not for everyone caregiving classes and support groups can be helpful. again the alzheimer's association and family caregiver alliance are two good places to begin your search. if you're comfortable going online there are also many communities where you can discuss issues and get support and information from others in a similar situation. if you're suffering from depression and would like to talk with a mental health provider you can ask your primary care doctor or someone close to you for a referral. also check for local resources through your county department of mental health or the national mental health association.
ebola is transmitted by body fluids such as blood mucous and perhaps even sweat by a person who actually has ebola. a zillion medical and non-medical conditions can cause a simple fever so the presence of fever does not mean that (a) you have ebola or (b) that you are contagious.
if you have any of these signs call 911 right away: difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. pain or pressure in the chest or abdomen. sudden dizziness. confusion. severe or persistent vomiting. a high fever that is not responding to tylenol. decreased or no movement of your baby.
the majority of malignant or cancerous melanomas are brown-to-black pigmented lesions. other signs of a cancerous melanoma include:
"prostate-specific antigen (psa) takes two major forms in the blood. one is attached, or bound, to blood proteins and the other circulates freely. the percent-free psa test indicates how much psa circulates free compared to the total psa level. the percentage of free psa is lower in men who have prostate cancer than in men who do not. studies show that if your psa results are in the borderline range (4 to 10), a low percent-free psa (less than 10%) means that the likelihood of having prostate cancer is about 50% and that you should probably have a biopsy."
complications of flu can include bacterial pneumonia ear infections sinus infections dehydration and worsening of chronic medical conditions such as congestive heart failure asthma or diabetes.

"assuming you're using a mouthwash that does not contain alcohol you should be fine. look for mouthwash that specifically says ""alcohol free"" or ""contains no alcohol"" on the label. you should be able to find both brand name and generic mouthwash preparations that contain no alcohol. oral care is very important during pregnancy including brushing and flossing because some studies have shown women without gum disease have increased odds of delivering a full-term baby. if you have questions about oral care during pregnancy you can visit your dentist. he or she will be happy to guide you. best wishes!"
doctors can usually identify shingles when they see an area of rash around the left or right side of your body. if a diagnosis of shingles is not clear your doctor may order lab tests most commonly herpes tests on cells taken from a blister. if there is reason to think that shingles is present your doctor may not wait to perform tests before treating you with antiviral medicines. early treatment may help shorten the length of the illness and prevent complications such as postherpetic neuralgia. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

most treatments for osteoporosis  like bisphosphonates and serms  work by slowing down the process of bone loss. since your body is always naturally remodeling bone slowing down the rate of bone loss may allow it to make new bone faster than you lose it. however forteo is the first treatment that directly spurs the growth of bone. it's usually given as an injection once a day in the thigh or abdomen. prolia works to stop bone loss by directing inhibiting cells that remove bone before they cause bone loss.
i'm sorry your daughter went through this. i hope she has been successfully treated for her anorexia and bulimia. the symptoms you describe could be caused by many things and only a health care professional can tell for sure what caused this episode. however if indeed this was an isolated incident one likely cause of these symptoms is low blood sugar ( hypoglycemia ). if a person doesn't eat regularly or if they work too hard and neglect their health overall their blood sugar can drop and cause precisely the symptoms you describe. in a case like that giving sugar is the best remedy. crackers would do the trick because the carbohydrates would quickly be converted to simple sugars. if the crackers and water made your daughter feel better chances are good this was just an episode of hypoglycemia. your daughter can avoid future episodes by taking care of herself including eating quality foods on a regular schedule drinking plenty of water and exercising. with her history of anorexia and bulimia it's important she maintains healthy non-compulsive eating and exercise habits. if she needs help with this she should see a psychologist who specializes in eating disorders. often these services are available on a sliding fee scale. i want to emphasize i'm only speculating about one possible cause for your daughter's episode. getting to the root cause of what happened requires a physical exam and some blood testing. your daughter needs to find a way to obtain medical care not only because of what happened with the fainting but to help manage her health eating disorders anxiety and tobacco use. wishing you all well!
"well your best bet honestly is to contact your surgeon's office and ask them directly. they can look the information up in your chart. but i can tell you that ""bladder sling"" is a term normally used regarding bladder suspension surgery in women with prolapsed bladders. a bladder sling restores the urinary bladder to its correct position within the pelvic cavity. (men with urinary incontinence after prostatectomy may also have bladder sling surgery. ) in lumbar fusion surgery the approach normally is from the back. (did you lie face-down for your surgery? ) the abdominal cavity is never entered so the positioning of your bladder is of no consequence. you likely did have a foley catheter inserted to drain your bladder for your comfort during surgery but this probably was removed before you even woke up from surgery. i hope this helps!"
"when someone is making strong nutrition claims like this i always ask people to inquire about the research used to support the claim. many times people without a health or science background translate information into something that is not accurate. green leafy vegetables contain oxalates but there is no evidence that these foods are bad for health. there are instances where someone may need to limit oxalates such as those who are prone to kidney stones but this is not a concern for the general ""healthy"" population. most people can include green leafy vegetables like those in smoothies as part of a healthy diet. in fact it is encouraged! the 2010 dietary guidelines recommend green leafy vegetables along with those that are orange (sweet potatoes carrots etc. ) starchy (potatoes corn) and other vegetables like cucumbers and zucchini. variety is always best to meet nutritional needs and maximize health. if you are concerned about oxalates check with your health care provider."
yes yeast infections can be spread both orally and sexually.

thanks dr. can ibs really affect your bladder though to such an extent? my urethra and bladder feel as if i have the worst uti imaginable but no bacterial infection could be found. i know the colon and bladder are closely related so maybe this is a possibility?
that would depend on the cause of the vertigo. i have to tell you that there are hundreds of different causes. some will self-resolve over time and some will require medications to control the symptoms. if your vertigo has been persistent you will need to see your primary care medical provider or an ent for a thorough examination to look for a possible cause.

although people infected with toxoplasmosis are often unaware of having this disease typical symptoms are flu-like and include swollen lymph nodes and muscle aches and pains that last from a few days to several weeks. if your immune system is normal you cannot get the infection again.
if the person had an obvious active herpetic lesion on their lips (herpes labialis) at the time you have been exposed if you allowed them to drink from your glass. whether you will get herpes on your lip depends on many things from your own susceptibility the strength of your immune system the level of exposure etc. there is really nothing you can do about it now. keep in mind that exposure in no way insures that you will get it. if you have had cold sores/fever blisters (other names for herpetic lesion on the lip) you already have it.
have you had chickenpox before? if not you should be immune after this infection. rarely you can get reinfected again by chickenpox. to answer your question yes but less likely. i didn't get chickenpox from shots but when my sister got it i had to avoid her. she got infected again few days after recovery from someone else at school. just remember to wash and clean the area where you've been to get rid of chicken pox. good luck

steroid induced cataract treated by surgery. and consultation in order not to happen to the other lensbut regarding the inflammation please consult an opthalmologist
call your doctor first. many primary care clinicians do not have the proper equipment (like a slit lamp or instruments to remove a corneal metal splinter) or even the person skill to do it. you may be better off going to an urgent care or occupational health facility that does this all of the time or even a eye doctor. again. call the facility or provider first to make sure they do this. certain ferrous metals can quickly rust and cause a ring making the treatment more complicated so the sooner you do this the better.
maybe. if she is well into puberty (breast development pubic hair etc. ) but certainly there are other causes. accidental straddle-type injuries can cause vaginal or hymen tears. some virginal hymens are nearly imperforate (little or no opening) and an injury could have caused a rupture. this sensitive area is rich in blood supply so bleeding can be concerning. it may be wise to have her examined by her medical provider (hopefully someone who is sensitive and caring and will not cause her undue embarrassment). ask her about possible injuries and sadly ask if anyone has touched her inappropriately. most of the time however these sudden bleeding episodes are trauma but if they occur again in a cycle. this could have been her first period.

"maybe you could start with smaller bouts of exercise instead of 50 minutes. start walking for 5 minutes per day and as you feel stronger increase to 10 and so on. make sure you eat something about 30 minutes before exercising like a banana yogurt or granola bar. if you are low on glycogen (stores of carbohydrates in muscle) it could increase your tiredness after exercise. if you continue to feel tired without a good reason visit your healthcare provider for a full blood work-up. certain nutrient deficiencies like anemia can also make you tired. hey there can be a lot of reasons for all this happening to you 1. first of you should must adjust carbohydrate quantity and qualityin your diet 2. your muscles are also not strong enough as you dont do workout regularly 3. may be you are not well hydrated. take fluids with essential electrolytes before during and after exercise. 4. start working out regularly or alternatively one day rest and the next workout. 5. always do a little warm up before exercise and stretching after the exercise. 6. eat proteins a bit more than you normally eat so that your muscles can develop. 7. take at least 8 hours sleep a day which should must have a ciesta of 1 to 2 hours. 8. take a cup of coffee an hour before doing exercise this will boost your metabolism and keep you vigilant for a couple of hour at least. 9. and at last your tiredness can also be a result of some medical condition like hypothyroidism or some metabolic disease i am a 5 year med student i was skinny a 2 year before and same things used to happen to me then i started using the techniques that i mentioned above and it really improved my stamina my muscle size and my mood especially i gained 10 kg of weight without any increase in my waist. that was a just a brief overview of the solution to your problem if you want details of all this i am here to help you muhammad noman imtiaz cuba nomanimtiaz@ucmex. vcl. sld. cu i have chronic fatigue syndrome and exercising makes me worse. it's called ""exercise malaise"". i don't know if that's what you have but i would ask your doctor. i like yoga. i always feel rejuvenated after yoga."
it's always nice when people put some thought into the types of foods they put into their bodies. frozen vegetables certainly can be a healthy choice for any diet. you should avoid frozen vegetables packaged in sauces (like broccoli in cheese sauce) and focus instead on plain vegetables. green beans peas corn broccoli cauliflower and many other frozen vegetables make excellent choices. the great thing about frozen vegetables is convenience. you can buy a big bag throw it in your freezer and use only what you need. you don't have to worry about whether or not a particular vegetable (or fruit) is in season and you don't have to worry much about spoilage. i also want to point out that frozen fruits can be a very cost-effective way to incorporate more healthful produce into your diet. fresh blueberries for example can be quite expensive but a bag of frozen ones usually is very reasonably priced. you can even get organic frozen fruits if you prefer. as you can tell i'm a fan of frozen vegetables and fruits. i use them frequently myself. wishing you well!
there is absolutely no connection between the seasonal flu shots and alzheimers disease.
in my opinion circumcision may be medically necessary for recurrent or serious cases it is not the only treatment. another remedy is antibiotics but only for bacterial infections. a problem with antibiotics is their overuse since antibiotic treatments can contribute to antibiotic resistance (a major medical problem today) and other causes of the inflammation and infection can be caused by a fungus and therefore be unresponsive to antibiotic treatment antifungal creams can help then. maintain good penile hygiene. if they are recurrent then you can go for surgery. thanks
hi if like my wife you keep a little book noting down when you your periods start then you need to look about 6 to 7 weeks before that november date because your pregnancy goes from that date so it would have been 14 days after that date give or take a day. your ovulation day is day 14 after the first day your period started. so you must have had unprotected sex 3 to 7 days before that date and that's the only real way you can work it out. ok hope this helps you. good luck
i understand how frustrating it can be to try different diets only to not lose weight or gain it all back. it's important to remember you are not alone and most people have difficulty losing weight and keeping it off. in fact a major review found that two thirds of people who diet not only gain their weight back but gain even more weight than when they started the diet. i'm not sure what your health is like or how much you need to lose but you might want to consider a different approach. one that doesn't focus so much on weight (here's why). the problem with diets is that they don't get at the root cause of someone's eating. you might want to consider working with a registered dietitian who focuses on eating issues and a more intuitive/mindful eating approach. the key is to develop a healthy lifestyle you enjoy that helps you lose gradual weight instead of an unrealistic diet that is hard to maintain. you can find a dietitian near you by going to eatright. org. if you are worried about a medical condition by all means get a physical and check your thyroid and discuss your health status with a healthcare provider. good luck!
the perverse situations in states that don't expand medicaid is that it's people with the lowest incomes who can't afford insurance without financial help who will be left without options. only people with incomes between $11 490 and $46 000 annually are eligible for subsidies. below that the law requires people to get coverage through medicaid so in states not expanding the program people earning less that $11 490 would have to pay the full cost of private insurance or go without coverage.

"healing time is an individual process and of course i have no idea of the type or severity of the toe fracture. assuming it is a ""little one"". non-displaced then it usually takes 3-4 weeks before sufficient healing takes place. this is just a guess however since i don't know the details of this case."

maybe. lymph nodes enlarge or become tender in response to an infection or inflammation in their immediate drainage neighborhood. since your doctor was not able to find a source for this pain or inflammation it would not be inappropriate to have some basic tests first (like a cbc - complete blood count). many things including dental disorders can cause an enlarged lymph node so consider a visit to your dentist as well.
not likely. both antibiotics are in the same class so it is more likely to be resistant as well (but not 100%).
gallstones can cause pancreatitis and they usually require surgical removal. ultrasound or a ct scan can detect gallstones and can sometimes give an idea of the severity of the pancreatitis. when gallstone surgery can be scheduled depends on how severe the pancreatitis is. if the pancreatitis is mild gallstone surgery may proceed within about a week. more severe cases may mean gallstone surgery is delayed for a month or more. after the gallstones are removed and inflammation goes away the pancreas usually returns to normal.
though the previous answer is right i want to notice that a few steps have been done in order for covering liposuction and other cosmetic procedures. recently baaps (british association of aesthetic plastic surgeons) decided that insurance for plastic surgery complications is necessary! probably in a few years liposuction will be covered by insurance source: 
i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it's always scary when we feel as if we can't breathe! i'd recommend you see a doctor about this. you didn't say what your age is but many conditions can cause the symptoms you describe  and some of them are more common at older ages. only a physical examination by a health care professional can help get to the cause of this and treat it appropriately. i hope you're able to see a doctor soon and get to the bottom of this unpleasant situation!
"how do you keep her from playing in the middle of the street? answer: you parent her. let her have water only in the sippy cup. then it doesn't matter if she has it or not. no milk! she will protest a bit but remember. you are the parent and you set the rules. you think is is hard now; wait until she is 13! a four-year old can be put in time-out for biting even if you have to hold in the chair for the required several minutes. use the stove timer as the ""warden"" and use a special little chair that can be placed in the kitchen or living room; wherever you choose. do not put her in the bedroom and shut the door or it will make her room a prison cell not a place of rest or play. she needs to be observed during the entire time-out period. at the end (when the timer goes off) hug and forgive her. reminding her that she is a good girl and good girls do not (fill in the blank). children really want to behave and follow the rules but that little devil inside her sometimes gets loose. remember to look for the ""good things"" she does and immediately acknowledge them with love and praise."

at five weeks of pregnancy if you have had intercourse with your husband which was not advisable the bleeding is likely to be decidual separation at the uteroplacental junction and should well be ruled out by an urgent transvaginal ultrasound. it would be prudent to rule out any retroplacental clot which if seen indicates threatened miscarriage. ideally you should visit your casualty and get the ultrasound done. if things are fine then you should practice absolute bed rest with progestational support till the bleeding stops. traveling is not advised at all. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online

essentially its just the receptors got fed a little bit. it might prolong their death which takes 26 or 28 days. what i'd like to tell you though is that after two weeks the craving only hit you 2-4 times a day and are so short one cup of tea later and they've gone. the other thing is this. get yourself down to a health food shop. they have cigarettes and tobacco with no nicotine. taste like horse hair tbh but are so satisfying and not addictive just for emegencies you know not failure its precaution. you see i was a heavy smoker and my cravings were easily lasting 20 minutes not the 4 minutes promised to me by quit smoking websites! i knew full well i wan't getting a hit from them but they took the craving away. i wasn't crawling the walls at all. in fact the first few days i felt like i was waiting for a craving. lots of folks would say no dont smoke at all. but the fact is once the physical addiction has past (28 days) you don't feel like a herbal. i still take them with me to festivals or big gatherings where i know i'm gonna struggle. if i have one i have one its better than having a real one and thinking you can get away with it. i've quit 5 times in total

this is a great question. as a pharmacist i recommend each patient has what we call a medication list which is a list of all of your medications. use one pharmacy. we have a lot of people who say they go to different pharmacies and what they don't understand is that i cant see the medications you are getting filled at other chains. or other independent pharmacies i only can see what you have filled in my particular store. so i need that medication list to make sure that there is no duplications of therapy. similar medication that may have the same ingredients in them but don't realize because they have different names to them. get to know your pharmacist on a first name basis. we are the medication experts that's why we went to pharmacy school. all of our years are dedicated to learning about medications and how they work. so when i am able to see all of this information i may be able to point out a few things and therefore call your doctor or healthcare provider and say by the way did you know that dr. such and such prescribed this; they may have never been aware. so there is a possibility that you could be taking too many medications. that's our role as a pharmacist is to look out for the patient make sure that you are safe and that you are taking your medications in the right way.
"we tend to advise our patients to avoid high impact activities following hip and knee arthroplasty procedures. so we do not want people running or jumping if it can be avoided. there really is no consensus opinion about activities following hip and knee replacement. different surgeons will allow different amounts of activity. if a patient of mine wants to do some weight training i tend to advise them to avoid really heavy weights and focus more on ""reps"". i also tend to tell my patients to try to maintain exercise as they can because i certainly feel that the benefit gained from the exercise likely outweighs the wear seen by the implant. it is certain that you will have less wear if you do not exercise at at all but that will likely come at the expense of your overall health."
i'm not sure if you're saying your depo shot expired 3 months ago or if the last time you had a booster was 3 months ago. if your depo shot expired 3 months ago then you can absolutely get pregnant by unprotected sex. the depo shot is not a permanent solution. depo-provera birth control lasts roughly 14 weeks in a woman's system before being completely ineffective but the shot must be received every 12 weeks to maintain full protection.

this is a good question you can always ask your pharmacist. an increase in appetite and weight gain are side effects of prevacid. if you have gained a reasonable amount of weight i would suggest speaking with your health care provider. if you need to stay on the medication you will probably need to make some lifestyle changes including diet and exercise.
this is a question you need to ask a pharmacist. and your doctor. i hope you are not substituting medications on your own without medical supervision. that is not a good thing to do. any time you are not sure when or how to take a medication that has been prescribed to you it is always ok to ask your pharmacist. he or she is an expert who can help you understand everything you need to know about your medications. hope this helps!

the pregnancy test is quite sensitive meaning it will pick up over 99% of true pregnancies. it would be unusual for you to be pregnant after having taken 3 pregnancy tests. have you missed your period? if so the pregnancy test should be positive. if you continue to have the symptoms you should repeat the test in several weeks. the other part is have you had unprotected intercourse since your last menstrual period? if so then you may have to wait a little more time before finding out. .

i am not a doctor but wanted to respond to the nutritional aspects. some of the symptoms you list such as frequent urination are symtpoms of type 1 diabetes. i'm not saying you have it but it is worth being checked out. as for the dizzy feelings after sugar it's hard to say. i would aim to eat balanced meals with a protein healthy fat whole grains and fruits and vegetables. if you eat sugar do so after a balanced meal or snack. eating sugary foods on an empty stomach may contribute to the dizzy feelings. the best possible thing to do is get a physical that includes lab work to make sure everything is okay. in the meantime focus on taking care of yourself by eating well and getting sleep.
this is the product alli or orlistat that's available over-the-counter and is still available as prescription known as xenical. what they do is it actually binds to fat that's in fatty foods and it absorbs it and makes it bind together so when you actually have a bowel movement it's passed through that way. so it's never really absorbed in the body the fat triazole 9:38 it's like a sponge it soaks it up. it's very safe. it is effective. the over-the-counter version is actually half of the dose of the prescription so therefore there are less treatment effects such as abdominal pain. a lot of people say that they see oil or fatty stools that's absolutely fine that's actually the medication working. what it does is it tries to train you to eat better. the alli website has a lot of great examples of menus. they even have a book that will tell you when you go to places like mcdonald's or burger king what you can and cannot eat. if you happened to have a really fatty meal you're going to know because you probably will be in the bathroom for a little bit longer than what you expected but once again it's training you to eat healthier. so they are really good product and once again all their literature is great because they advise you that you should be doing things like exercising and drinking more water using things like a pedometer tracking your progress and then also having realistic expectations. you're not going to lose 20 pounds in one month that's not really a good goal to have. gradual weight loss is the way to go and if you end up losing two or three pounds per month that's great and plus too you're changing your lifestyle. a lot of pharmacists have gotten a lot of questions about this product since it was launched in 2007 and it really has been a great way for pharmacists to get to know their patients better. come and ask us for the medication experts we're happy to help you.

after you are diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) your doctor will likely prescribe antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) such as fluoxetine (for example prozac ). antidepressants are thought to help balance neurotransmitters (such as serotonin) in your brain. in some cases it takes time to adjust the dosage or find the right medicine that will work for you. you may start to feel better within 1 to 3 weeks of taking an ssri. but it can take as many as 12 weeks to see more improvement. if you have questions or concerns about your medicines or if you do not notice any improvement by 3 weeks talk to your doctor. your doctor may increase the dosage of your medicine change to another ssri or use another medicine known as clomipramine if the medicine first prescribed does not help. clomipramine a tricyclic antidepressant has been used for years to treat ocd but it may have more side effects than ssris. your doctor may prescribe other medicines if you have other conditions along with ocd. medication choices antidepressants (ssris) such as fluoxetine (for example prozac) fluvoxamine ( luvox ) and sertraline ( zoloft ) are commonly prescribed to treat ocd. these medicines are taken as tablets or capsules. the medicine venlafaxine can also help symptoms of ocd. the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine ( anafranil ) is sometimes used as well. antidepressants are used to relieve the obsessive thoughts and subsequent compulsive behaviors in those who have ocd. by increasing the level of serotonin in the brain antidepressants help to regulate the communication between different parts of the brain. other medicines (such as antipsychotics) are sometimes used to treat ocd. what to think about a person with ocd may also have other anxiety disorders that complicate treatment and require using other medicines. for children and adolescents with ocd treatment combining cognitive-behavioral therapy with antidepressants (ssris) such as sertraline works better than only taking medicine. cognitive-behavioral therapy alone also works well but it works better if it is combined with medicine. 7 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

i don't know what country that you are currently living but you may want to try and get a second opinion from another orthopedic surgeon. since i have no way of personally evaluating your son reviewing those x-rays knowing the exact location on the femur etc. so i really cannot offer any patient-specific opinion. pediatric femur fractures can be very challenging to properly treat especially in a two year old so continue to be your son's advocate and insist that another orthopedist take a look at him.

recently i read an interesting article in w magazine entitled prematurely plastic.  the article looked at young women in their 20s who were having various cosmetic procedures to hold back the ticking clock of time. is this proper? should lindsay lohan at age 24 be the poster girl for having a variety of injections including botox? one commenter said some people wake up at 42 and realize they need to return to 36. but the people who end up looking best have been planning for it all along.  these are judgment calls. if young people want to have a little botox or its competitor dysport or filling injections even though the indications are very weak little risk is incurred. on the other hand if it is done incorrectly the strange frozen look can present itself after botox or dysport. and when fillers are overdone as we see with certain celebrities the duck lip is not too attractive. common sense should be employed. i see very few teens or young adults in their 20s who are looking old.  even here in california where the standards are high and the sun is strong. dont believe everything you read in the newspapers or magazines or see on tv. watch out for fluff and hype.

the development of scar tissue is how our bodies respond to a breach in our skin as when your cat's claw pierced the skin of your upper lip. unfortunately scar tissue is not skin tissue and does not look the same or feel the same. with time most scar tissue recedes in size and the pink color will turn more white making it less noticeable. one thing you might try is very gently rubbing a little vitamin e-based oil or cream over the area with the scar to help with the healing process and to diminish the appearance of the scar. if it really is a problem you'll want to talk to a plastic surgeon about your options.
plaques from atherosclerosis can: stay within the artery wall. there the plaque grows then stops. they don't block blood flow so may never cause symptoms. grow in a slow controlled way into the path of blood flow. eventually they cause significant blockages. pain on exertion (in the chest or legs) is the usual symptom. in the worst case they can suddenly rupture allowing blood to clot inside an artery. in the brain this causes a stroke; in the heart a heart attack. the plaques cause three kinds of cardiovascular disease: coronary artery disease: stable plaques in the heart's arteries cause angina (chest pain on exertion). sudden plaque rupture and clotting causes heart muscle to die. this is a heart attack or myocardial infarction. cerebrovascular disease: ruptured plaques in the brain's arteries causes strokes with potential for permanent brain damage. temporary artery blockages can also cause transient ischemic attacks (tias) warning signs of stroke; however there is no brain injury. peripheral artery disease: narrowing in the arteries of the legs caused by plaque. that causes poor circulation pain on walking and poor wound healing. severe disease may lead to amputations.

osteoarthritis is a joint disease that mostly affects cartilage. cartilage is the slippery tissue that covers the ends of bones in a joint. healthy cartilage allows bones to glide over each other. it also helps absorb shock of movement. in osteoarthritis the top layer of cartilage breaks down and wears away. this allows bones under the cartilage to rub together. the rubbing causes pain swelling and loss of motion of the joint. over time the joint may lose its normal shape. also bone spurs may grow on the edges of the joint. bits of bone or cartilage can break off and float inside the joint space which causes more pain and damage. people with osteoarthritis often have joint pain and reduced motion. unlike some other forms of arthritis osteoarthritis affects only joints and not internal organs. rheumatoid arthritis  the second most common form of arthritis  affects other parts of the body besides the joints. osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis.

blood appearing in both places obviously relate to the digestion system. the color of the blood is significant in each area. my thoughts at first were the stomach but the doctors should have ruled out an ulcer. blood in the vomit ( i think) has to come from either the esophagus or stomach. blood else where usually develops in the intestine. chron's disease has theses symptoms but as i mentioned earlier with the all the test i would think that if chron's it would have been diagnosed. doctors need our help at times. maybe suggest possible ulcers in the stomach and or intestine. also mention chron's as any other auto-immune disease. i believe a simple blood test can rule out most. however i hold no certified medical training. i've found that i have had to take control of my health by being informed and researching problems and therapies. several times it was me not my doctor that provided the knowledge to heal myself although i did need her to write the prescription. second and or third opinions are always appropriate actions when your doctor is or has not diagnosed your problem.

mental health services must be a covered benefit in all new health plans sold on the individual insurance market for plans that start january 1 2014. that's a requirement of the affordable care act. if you're currently not working i recommend you begin shopping for health plans through your state's health insurance marketplace which opened for business on october 1st. without an income you'll no doubt qualify for subsidies that are likely to lower the cost of your health insurance coverage and lower deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs. just keep in mind these plans won't take effect until january 1 2014.

both of these medications can be used to treat pain. they are not similar in how they work though. naproxen is an anti-inflammatory drug so it tries to decrease inflammation that could be causing the pain. darvocet is actually a combination product that uses a codeine-like ingredient along with an acetaminophen component. if you ever have any questions about medications talk to your pharmacist.

"no. just your wallet. natural ""male enhancement"" supplements are worthless."
regarding the question about drug costs in actuality 80% of prescription drugs sold in this country are generic  and prices of drugs haven't risen greatly in the past few years. what has increased however is the portion many of us have to pay toward the cost of our drugs which is likely what you're experiencing. that's not a function of obamacare but rather a funtion of employers (assuming you get insurance at work) and insurers shifting more costs onto consumers as a way of getting control over their own costs. unfortunately that's a trend that's likely to continue.

i can't really offer you a diagnosis over the internet but based solely on the information you have shared you are more likely to have a cold (viral respiratory infection). influenza tends to cause a higher fever more body aches and a very nasty cough. assuming you did not get a flu vaccine this season it is not too late. there are rapid tests for influenza type a and b but after about four days colds and even influenza tend to improve without medical intervention.

"if i'm not mistaken the mayo clinic studied this and said only one anti biotic has been shown to impact birth control's effectiveness at all. it's ""rifampin"". out of an abundance of caution some doctors suggest using a second form of birth control for a month. i'm not sure how much it's affecting your life now or how much an unwanted pregnancy would mess things up. i never bothered with an extra form of birth control b/c of anti biotics but surely one month of a back up won't hurt."

every woman's body is different in some ways so a dr must be seen immediately to arrange blood tests mammogram +/or any scans they deem necessary of course. in my case i also had frequent urination sore nipples then my breasts began to have a nipple discharge +/or leakage+i was not pregnant in fact i had a hysterectomy. my dr ordered a pituitary gland scan lab tests mammogram urination analysis+smear of breast fluids. by lab work up+breast secretion smear found i had a high prolactin level that is usually found in women in the 2nd trimester that caused the nipple soreness+discharge that went away in time. i also did not empty my bladder properly +/or completely instead of the usual overactive bladder. remember just as every case is not the same each diagnosis is not the same so please make the appointments. good health happy life
you don't mention how much weight you have to lose. if you don't carry that much weight you might be at the place your body wants to be. your blood pressure is good but how about other health indicators like cholesterol? if you weight is too high you need to closely look at how much and what you are eating. do you eat mindfully by sitting down to meals and stopping when comfortably full? do you skip meals? how is your diet quality? research shows that exercise doesn't aid weight loss as much as diet. another factor is stress as you mention which can affect appetite. getting a handle on stress management can go a long way. here is more reading that can help: do you really need to lose weight? why can't i lose weight? hi for me if you was doing everything you say then you would be losing weight. but your not so your cheating its the only answer you need to as strict with what your doing as you say above do that and you will lose weight. but get on to some of these new ways of losing weight like the caveman. get out walking but brisk walking take a weighted back pack and when doing that find some hills to climb get up early go swimming these last two are some of the best ways to lose weight you just keep away from fast foods and junk foods and no sodas drink lots of water. all ways think of these self discipline. self control. breaking bad habits. in grain these in your mind. good luck
two ultrasound studies of women who exercised their vaginal muscles did find that their muscles were thicker and stronger after pelvic floor muscle training. among women with urine leakage their thinner muscles became the thickness of healthy women's pelvic floor muscles. additionally they had less urine leakage  whether the problem was from stress or urge types of incontinence. the use of vaginal cones and/or kegel exercises to increase muscle strength were both found to improve tone and decrease urine loss. while some of these studies did not measure vaginal tightness per se when muscle bulk is increased a woman can voluntarily contract those muscles to make the vaginal opening tighter. yes it will tighten that area. i guarentee you! contract and relax those muscles repeatedly 7 to 10 times then hold tightly/contract for as long as you can while sitting at a stop light in your car at the office watching tv or when ever you think about it and you will notice results quickly and so will your partner. if you can't always do it for that long of a time or that many reps don't worry. any added amount will make a difference. yes it will make them tighter. that's the exercise my gynecologist told me to do after i had a baby. it really worked for me my husband could tell the difference. if you don't know how to do them you hold in the muscles that you use if you had to pee for a few seconds then release then hold again. you can do them all day at your desk home or driving in your car. the more you use these muscles the quicker you'll see results. i think so yes. in addition i have found that if your legs are in good shape because you exercise regulary then it tends to tighten up your pelvic floor muscles to. just my own personal experience of course. yes it will make them tighter. that's the exercise my gynecologist told me to do after i had a baby. it really worked for me my husband could tell the difference. if you don't know how to do them you hold in the muscles that you use if you had to pee for a few seconds then release then hold again. you can do them all day at your desk home or driving in your car. the more you use those muscles the quicker your results.

viruses causing hemorrhagic fever are initially transmitted to humans when the activities of infected reservoir hosts or vectors and humans overlap. the viruses carried in rodent reservoirs are transmitted when humans have contact with urine fecal matter saliva or other body excretions from infected rodents. the viruses associated with arthropod vectors are spread most often when the vector mosquito or tick bites a human or when a human crushes a tick. however some of these vectors may spread the virus to animals  livestock for example. humans then become infected when they care for or slaughter the animals. some viruses that cause hemorrhagic fever can spread from one person to another once an initial person has become infected. ebola marburg lassa and crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever viruses are examples. this type of secondary transmission of the virus can occur directly through close contact with infected people or their body fluids. it can also occur indirectly through contact with objects contaminated with infected body fluids. for example contaminated syringes and needles have played an important role in spreading infection in outbreaks of ebola hemorrhagic fever and lassa fever.

a doctor's physical exam is often enough to diagnose a hernia. sometimes hernia swelling is visible when you stand upright; usually the hernia can be felt if you place your hand directly over it and then bear down. ultrasound may be used to see a femoral hernia and abdominal x-rays may be ordered to determine if a bowel obstruction is present.
i'm no physician but i'm familiar with friends and family who have diabetes. even if physically fit people can still have diabetes. it may also be a sign that the level of iron in your blood is significantly low. anemia is a condition associated with low iron where staying warm is a challenge. taking iron pills or daily vitamins may help your blood stay healthy and circulate properly allowing good blood flow through out the body. thus keeping your body temperature normal. probably having your blood sugar and levels checked couldn't hurt. at least that would be two things you could narrow down on the list. 
"i found that if i do a nasal rinse on a regular basis that i have way fewer sinus problems. you could try a nettie pot or possibly just a saline solution sprayed up the nose. if you ask at the pharmacy counter they can recommend not just a saline spray but also other nasal rinses that will keep the sinuses clear of all the ""junk"" that accumulates there. good luck!"

most helpful answer hi found you this on barycentre. com it could help or not? you ovulate from both sides if you have both ovaries. usually one side one month the other side the next but sometimes an ovary is the dominate ovary and does more then 50-50 (so you can't judge which side you'll ovulate on which is what i thought). one ovary could ovulate 8 times a year while the other only does 4 times a year. so if your good tube has the non-dominant ovary you could only get pregnant 4 times a year (or however many times it ovulates a year- from one to 12 times). the opposite tube can catch the egg but it's not likely. i only have one tube and conceived my son the first month we were trying. and from what i can read also seems that the right one is the more dominant one of the two which would not help you. you would just have to track your ovulation dates and make sure you have unprotected sex 4 days before reason its takes male sperm 3 days to get into the right place to receive your egg so 4 days means there sitting there waiting and sperm can live for up to 5 7 or 10 days depending where you read. hope this helps you. good luck

high blood pressure  in men and women  is a big problem. one in every three adult americans  about 65 million people  have high blood pressure also known as hypertension. many more are at risk of developing it. over half of all americans 60 and older have it and over a lifetime the risk of developing high blood pressure is 90%. typically blood pressure increases with age. the risk of high blood pressure begins to climb when men hit 45 although it can occur in younger men. african-americans tend to develop it younger and have more severe hypertension. obesity or a family history of high blood pressure also increases risk. high blood pressure is especially dangerous because people can have it for years without knowing. in fact one in three americans with the condition doesnt know it. despite these gloomy statistics however high blood pressure is not inevitable. there is plenty you can do to prevent delay and treat high blood pressure.

"masturbation is not harmful and will not affect your ability to achieve or maintain an erection during sex. if you are having these issues associate with sexual activity  your first sexual activity  this could just be ""stage fright"" or performance anxiety. while there can be organic reason why a person could not achieve an erection the fact that you are not having a problem with masturbation proves that the blood supply to your penis is adequate the nerves are working and all systems are ""go"". if (and when) you find a caring partner try to relax and allow nature to take its course when it comes to sexual activity. if you are still having problems you may need to see a counselor to help you through this anxiety-provoking event. many fears run through a man's mind when first-having sex: will i be able to perform? will i please my partner? will something happen that will embarrass me? will i get an std? many things. let sex ""happen"". don't be anyone but yourself."

it may not be in your hand. this could be a tattoo created by the graphite that appears like a piece of the pencil. if you did have a foreign body like a piece of the pencil it should have become infected a long time ago. if you did have a retained foreign body the biggest risk would be infection but clearly this has not happened. there would be no health consequences if this black area was just a residual tattoo.

unfortunately menopause is associated with dryness in many areas  the skin included. estrogen therapy does help in general but skin dryness alone is not an official indication for estrogen therapy. most dermatologists recommend lots of topical moisturizers. one other thing to remember is that as it gets colder and we keep our heat on more and more the air in the house tends to get drier. so adding moisture to the air in your home is a good idea  even getting a kid's vaporizer for the bedroom can be helpful. if moisture doesn't help do check in with your healthcare provider to rule out other skin issues like eczema.
this concerns me too and i want to urge you to make an appointment with your health care provider to have this checked out. it's impossible to say what's going on without doing a physical examination lab work and so on. but the situation you describe doesn't sound normal to me and i think it warrants an investigation. i hope i'm not alarming you. i don't think you need to run to the emergency room or anything like that. there could be a very simple reason why you're experiencing this big belly issue but i don't want you to delay getting checked out by your primary care provider. i wish you all the best! i have the same problem. my doctor order a cat scan but my insurance did not approved it jet. did you find out what was your problem?

hi well as you had your period on august 1st then around day 14 would have been your ovulation day give or take a day so have sex 2 to 7 days before that would have done it its takes male sperm 3 days to reach your womb and can live for up to 10 days max. so 2 weeks would be about right then your doctor would be basing his from your last period date so yes he's right. but dose it really matter when unless your not married and trying to workout who the father is by this calculation? hope this helps you. good luck

it is not that uncommon to have to have a manipulation after tka [total knee arthroplasty]. most studies suggest that the need for this procedure after tka ranges between 1 and 6%. it is most important to act quickly after the surgery and make the decision to do this if the patient is having trouble gaining motion. the patient is put to sleep and the knee is bent to break up the scar adhesions that have formed. there will be some pain afterwards and it is critical to get right back in to therapy after the procedure.

about 20% of women have some bleeding during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. possible causes of first trimester bleeding include: implantation bleeding. you may experience some normal spotting within the first six to 12 days after you conceive as the fertilized egg implants itself in the lining of the uterus. some women don't realize they are pregnant because they mistake this bleeding for a light period. usually the bleeding is very light and lasts from a few hours to a few days. miscarriage. because miscarriage is most common during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy it tends to be one of the biggest concerns with first trimester bleeding. about half of women who bleed in pregnancy eventually miscarry but that doesn't necessarily mean that if you're bleeding you've lost the baby especially if you don't have any other symptoms. other symptoms of miscarriage are strong cramps in the lower abdomen and tissue passing through the vagina. ectopic pregnancy. in an ectopic pregnancy the fertilized embryo implants outside of the uterus usually in the fallopian tube. if the embryo keeps growing it can cause the fallopian tube to burst which can be life-threatening to the mother. although ectopic pregnancy is potentially dangerous it only occurs in about 2% of pregnancies. other symptoms of ectopic pregnancy are strong cramps or pain in the lower abdomen and lightheadedness. molar pregnancy (also called gestational trophoblastic disease). this is a very rare condition in which abnormal tissue grows inside the uterus instead of a baby. in rare cases the tissue is cancerous and can spread to other parts of the body. other symptoms of molar pregnancy are severe nausea and vomiting and rapid enlargement of the uterus. additional causes of bleeding in early pregnancy include: cervical changes. during pregnancy extra blood flows to the cervix. intercourse or a pap test which cause contact with the cervix can trigger bleeding. this type of bleeding isn't cause for concern. infection. any infection of the cervix vagina or a sexually transmitted infection (such as chlamydia gonorrhea or herpes) can cause bleeding in the first trimester.
hi your right on the edge for effectiveness being 175 pounds but please read this below its from womanshealthmag. com hra pharma the european manufacturer of the emergency contraption drug norlevo recently added a warning on its packaging that states it starts losing effectiveness for women who weigh 165 pounds or moreâ€”and that the drug isn't effective at all for women above 175 pounds. why that matters in the u. s.? norlevo is chemically identical to the one- and two-pill versions of plan b as well as its generics like next choice and my way says jessica arons president and ceo of reproductive health technologies project a birth control advocacy group. so for you its hit or miss but if you really don't need this there's always the abortion pill if you get a positive test. hope this helps you. good luck
most helpful answer hi her quitting and going cold turkey will benefit her and her baby straight away. throwing out her cigarettes and vowing never to smoke again may be difficult for her for a few weeks but each day she will fill better for it. but there's no evidence that the stress of suddenly quitting smoking has any effect on your baby so that would be the way for her to go. this would also benefit the baby if she carries on it could be under weight. do hope this helps. good luck
let's talk for a minute about how hiv is transmitted. the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) spreads from person to person by direct contact with infected bodily fluids such as semen blood or vaginal fluids. any exposure to hiv results in a risk of getting the virus yourself. however the exact risk of acquiring hiv from a single exposure isn't known. in short it's impossible to answer your question because there are too many unknown factors. if you performed an unprotected (no condom used) penile insertion with an hiv positive individual (even for just one second) then you have some risk of getting hiv yourself. if your partner does not have hiv then you have no risk of getting hiv because the virus can only be acquired from direct exposure to infected bodily fluids. that said it's never a good idea to have unprotected sex whether anally or vaginally because many other sexually transmitted diseases (stds) exist and can be spread in this way. especially if you're having sex with multiple partners you're always well-advised to use a condom  for your own protection and your partner's.

hi a cholesterol level of below 200 is very desirable so 120 would be good. a low triglyceride level is considered less then 50mg/dl and less then 35mg/dl is considered severely low. a triglyceride blood test is the best way to figure out your level. the blood test is performed after an eight- to 12-hour period of fasting to give the most accurate results. it is important to know certain medications cause abnormal test results. so are you really sure it was 24? your hdl 59 is good so at 69 its even better for you. your ldl levels are good at 32 anything below 100 is good. you said. i am now concerned about my mood - very irritable get angry easy and prone to impulsive anxious behaviour. this sounds very much like adhd i would see your own doctor and do go over this with him/her or perhaps your doctor will pass you on to another doctor who specializes in this form of medicine. do hope this helps you. good luck

success and failure are the two sides of the same coin. you can never predict what will happen. life is never a smooth sailing boat. it is full of ups and downs. life does not end when you fail once. life is much more than your exams. you gain experience when you go through failures and hardships. you become tough and will learn to handle more difficult situations in the future. if you have fallen down get up and pursue your goal. be persistent till you achieve your goal. all great people gone through failures before they become successful in life. success will come when you are optimistic. be brave and face life. for further information consult a psychiatrist online

fungus of the toenail always comes from fungus of the foot unless you get it from a pedicure. so if you have a true toenail fungus and you haven't had a pedicure ever and you don't have fungus of the foot then i would definitely be hesitant about that as a diagnosis. in order to take an oral antifungal like lamisil you really should have a culture of the toenail done to make sure that the fungus does grow out in culture in a nail clipping in order to make sure you have one before you treat it because not every change in the toenail even a yellow discoloration is fungus. sometimes it can be a type of eczema or psoriasis of the nail or some other type of infection. also sometimes nail polish removers can leave a yellow discoloration of the toenail. and if you add a drop of bleach to your nail polish remover that will take that yellow discoloration away. in runners i often see toenail changes especially in that first toe or the last toe and switching shoes can help as well. so not all nail changes are fungus. you need to have a known diagnosis and then you can use either an oral or a topical. i have found that neither one alone works very well to get rid of that fungus of the nail. you really need to use both together and then use a powder in the shoe or something that's going to absorb the moisture in order to prevent it from coming back. because people who are prone to it even after you cure it or you treat it appropriately it can recur. so there is really no true cure for this it's something you have to deal with over time.

this is a good question but it should be made clear that regulations around supplemental medicare plans known as medigap have nothering to do with the health reform law. medigap plans can be difficult to change over time because when you purhcase one outside of a certain timeframe medigap plans can take the state of your health into consideration when deciding whether or not to sell you a plan and for how much. so you can certainly inquire about changing plans and you should but understand the challenges you may face. i suggest you talk with a medicare counselor for personalized assistance with this matter. contact your state health insurance assistance programs (ship). to find the ship near you visit the medicare helpful contacts page on medicare. gov or call (800)medicare or 800-633-4227.
i've generally been unhappy with the hospital food served to patients. my main complaint is too much refined starch. food is generally bland or unhealthy or both. this is a sad state of affairs because good nutrition is expecially important when ill. however a patient who is proactive can often get decent food in the hospital. the first choice is to find out the dietary restrictions required by the acute circumstances and then to have a family member or friend bring appropriate food if possible (you need permission from the doctors and nurses to do this but can often get such permission). some patients order as much food as they can get such as extra pieces of fruit or double vegetables and then pick and choose the best from what appears on the tray. in my hospital they actually offer a la carte meal service so if someone wants just protein fruit and vegetables they can do pretty well. still better to eat homemade food if possible though even if it is homemade chicken soup.
well i'd suggest you at least call the doctor who diagnosed your anemia to discuss these symptoms. usually a person who's diagnosed with anemia is put on a treatment regimen that's appropriate to the type of anemia (for example iron supplements or b12 injections). unfortunately only your doctor can explain what might be going on with your health and recommend treatment. you may be able to have this conversation by phone in order to avoid an office visit charge but it depends on the health care provider. i'm sorry you're feeling so ill and hope you get some answers soon!

you would just have to ask the rn for her rationale. many people reject vaccines for a variety of reasons  some valid and some ridiculous. if these are her children then she has the right not to vaccinate or decide which vaccinations her children receive. the flu vaccine is optional as far as schools are concerned but not optional in my book. i am very pro-vaccine but i do allow the parents the right to refuse. they do have to hear my lecture however but in the end the decision is theirs. as a grandmother  and i am a grandparent too  we have memories of those days before vaccinations. some new parents have never seen the diseases that ravaged our generation.

i see no reason why they would counter-act each other. i'm not clear if your doctor wanted you to keep taking the stool softener or just take it to get your bowels moving. often times they are given temporarily. if your fiber intake is up  and you are having more bms  you could slowly taper off the stool softener. i would contact your doctor first since he/she prescribed it. probiotics can help with constipation but it depends on the strain.

since the child will be briefly under anesthesia it would seem logical to just probe both naso-lacrimal ducts at the same time. the procedure is fast and easy and really poses no additional risk to the child. a child with naso-lacrimal duct obstruction on one side may eventually develop the problem on both sides. by probing both sides you could head off a future obstruction.
you can't really rule out lung cancer but it likely wouldn't be caused by your therapy or the x-rays. you can help your compromised immune system plus the depression by getting plenty of antioxidant rich foods and exercising at least a few times a week. it may not be a cure but it will be a complement to your other treatments.

thank you for your answers. i know i had an ultra sound done last year and it showed a couple cysts but they said they were big enough to cause any problems so maybe thats what it is and a new one has shown up or an existing one has gotten worse maybe? yea ovulation could be a possibility too. i never thought about that but it would be hard to track my cycle to see because i have the mirena. sometimes i have a menstrual cycle and sometimes i go without one for months.

"migraine headache symptoms vary and may occur with or without a warning sign called an aura. people who get an aura which usually begins within 30 minutes before the headache starts may see spots wavy lines or flashing lights. some people have numbness or a ""pins-and-needles"" sensation in their hands arms or face during the aura. but most people do not have an aura before they get a migraine headache. common symptoms of migraine include: throbbing or pulsating headache on one side of your head. moderate to severe headache intensity. headache that gets worse with routine physical activity. nausea vomiting or both. sensitivity to light and noise and sometimes smells. there are several types of migraine headaches each with unique features. for example some women get migraines before during or shortly after their menstrual periods. it can be difficult to tell the difference between a migraine headache and another kind of headache (such as a tension or sinus headache ). you may think your headaches are sinus headaches but it is more likely they are migraine headaches if they happen often and interfere with your daily life. unlike other headaches migraines usually occur on one side of your head although the side that is affected can shift with each new attack. migraines are also often accompanied by sensitivity to light and noise. migraines may occur along with many other conditions such as asthma or depression. more serious conditions such as tumors or infections can also cause migraine-like symptoms. headaches that are caused by more serious health problems are rare. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

make sure that your blood test for hcg (pregnancy test) is the most accurate of the tests and make an appointment with your ob/gyn for an examination. in need be you can have an ultrasound. sometimes a woman wants to be pregnant so desperately that many of the symptoms are created by their anxious mind. it is not uncommon to have a false pregnancy in these situations but before that is determined to be the answer all diagnostic tests must be exhausted. and repeated.
its difficult to prevent the spread of genital herpes. many people infected with the herpes virus do not know they have it and the virus can be shed through the skin to infect other people even when no sores are present. condoms reduce the likelihood of transmission of the herpes virus but the virus can be transmitted from or to skin not covered by condoms. people who know they carry the genital herpes virus should avoid having sex when any symptoms of herpes are present. people with genital herpes can take daily suppressive antiviral medication like acyclovir or valacyclovir (valtrex); this reduces (but doesnt eliminate) the chances of infecting their partner. these are emotion-laden issues and if you have (or think you might have) genital herpes its important to get tested and discuss the issues with your partner before starting a sexual relationship.

i totally understand your concern regarding cure of allergies. unfortunately allergy of the nose cannot be totally cured but definitely can be prevented. i would recommend the following:1. get an allergy skin test done; so as to identify the allergen. avoiding the allergen is half the solution to the problem. the allergen source could be dust sources like carpets/bedding/mattresses. avoid indoor plants/pollens. pet fur/hair is also a common cause. 2. get a ct scan of your sinuses. you could be having polyps in your sinuses; which may be contributing to your nose block. if so; your ent doctor may advise you to undergo a surgery to open up your sinuses; to enable you to breathe better. 3. taking a steroid spray regularly will give relief of your symptoms. you do need to take it for 2-3 months during the season. taking an antihistamine like allegra with steroid sprays is beneficial in moderate allergic rhinitis. 4. the latest treatment is immunotherapy; offered in some allergy centres. you can contact your local specialist for the same. it is a permanent cure; but it takes a long time for the immunity to develop. hope the above helps. if you do have a scan do share it with me and i can guide you further. keep your allergies under control; as a neglected sneeze can lead to aggravation of your wheeze. consult an ent otolaryngologist online for further help  
hi doc thanks for your valuable advise & conclusion like i said in my initial post i have been working on my lifestyle (more hours of sleep & physical activities) and if this is my key to get rid of the symptoms i am experiencing then sure i will continue to do it. so to conclude i need not look out for any medications or further tests/checkup to be done for my ongoing symptoms?
most helpful answer the primary approach to properly managing acid reflux should be to actively identify and avoid certain foods that trigger your symptoms. here are some of the common foods that can trigger acid reflux:  fatty foods  acidic foods like citrus fruits or tomatoes and tomato-containing products  coffee caffeinated beverages or alcohol  chocolate or peppermint  spicy foods  garlic or onions also try to refrain from lying down after meals eating too much in one sitting eating less than two hours before going to bed or exercising or eating too quickly. quitting smoking and losing weight may also alleviate symptoms as well. i would suggest journaling your dietary intake and activities each day so that you can notice any trends in what might be provoking your symptoms. if you continue to experience acid reflux symptoms remedies might include over the counter products or prescription medication. certain alkaline foods may help to neutralize acid reflux too but its more important to prevent acid reflux from occurring in the first place by avoiding your triggers. consult with your doctor about long term treatment/management options and visit the webmd heartburn/gerd health center for more information.

i happen to think some of the most compassionate and helpful doctors are those who have experienced medical or disability challenges themselves and have successfully dealt with them. even though one doesn't get rid of fm it can be dealt with successfully. i hope your dream of becoming a pcp motivates you even more to learn about your fm and find success in dealing with it. then you can use your success with managing fm to motivate yourself through medical school and residency because there are a lot of future patients out there who need your help! medical school isn't easy but it's fun and rewarding. getting fm under control is probably the hardest part. then the rest of it should be a breeze! i know a number of doctors me included who have been able to practice successfully despite having fm. i would be thrilled to have you join our club in about 8 years!

blood in the semen is not a problem unless it is heavy and prolonged over time. it can come and go and be anywhere from bright red to dark old blood to brownish to spotty. it is scary- that is a fact. but it is not a problem that means anything about fertility or cancer. if you are still worried then see a urologist get an exam a psa and a urine check.
i have no way of examining you over the internet to determine if you have a sinus infection (sinusitis) so it is off to the take care clinic so you can be properly diagnosed and treated. a description of symptoms is rarely sufficient to make this important diagnostic decision.
simple answer: ask you doctor  someone who is familiar with your case and medical history. while a small amount of caffeine may not be contradindicated in most patients i don't know anything about your case to make that call for you specifically.
in my opinion that needs further evaluation as the history can indicate a brain damage the shivering could relate or could not relate as the form of shivering matters whether it is convulsions or shiver so a mri and eeg are needed.

40 years is a long time for the replaced joints to tolerate. a xray is essential to check for joint disorder or dysfunction. then a physiotherapist can help her by muscle strengthening and stretching plus adding a medical shoe or an insole to substitute the difference.
well you should consult an orthopaedic surgeon as they expertise in such kind of cases however initially you can be advised physiotherapy sessions to improve the movement of the joint as well as relieving pain by strengthening the muscles and ligaments. in case if there is no improvement then surgical treatment can be done to relieve fusion and improve movement. hope this information helps. regards.
hi try this it may help during the third week after the first day of your last period your fertilised egg moves along the fallopian tube towards the womb. the egg begins as a single cell which divides again and again. by the time the egg reaches the womb it has become a mass of more than 100 cells called an embryo. once in the womb the embryo burrows into the lining of the womb. this is called implantation. now by doing this it can cause some bleeding so perhaps that is what your getting. do hope this helps. good luck

one possible course of action if you live in the us is to visit your pharmacy as quickly as possible and pick up plan b. plan b is the name of an emergency contraceptive medication that is available without a prescription to women over age 15. you must ask a pharmacist for it and show proof of age. plan b works by either preventing ovulation (the release of an egg) or by interfering with fertilization of an egg. do not confuse plan b with other types of prescription emergency contraceptives that induce a miscarriage. that is not what plan b does at all. if you have any questions consult your pharmacist. he or she also can tell you if it's safe to resume taking your birth control pills. you may also wish to consult your health care provider as soon as possible to go over what happened what you did and get back on track with your birth control pills. if you frequently forget to take your pills keep in mind there are other methods of contraception available to you including depo-provera injections and intrauterine devices (iuds). you may wish to explore one of these options with your health care provider. best of luck to you!
"sometimes yes. sometimes no. sometimes only limited. you would need to check with your individual insurance policy on-line or call their information line. there are thousands of different insurances and you may find that getting a separate ""travel insurance"" (available on-line) would be wise. these private policies are quite affordable."
most helpful answer there are medications that can help but you need to be carefully examined by your gynecologist or a urologist first. there are many causes of urinary incontinence and a few types can be surgical corrected.
i would definitly take her or take her back to the emergency room and let them do more tests!
your chances are certainly higher than if you would have taking your birth control pills as directed and insisted that your partner use a condom. yes you could have easily gotten pregnant this way. if pregnancy is not your goal then i suggest that you start taking a few pregancy tests when the time is appropriate.

graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. graves' disease causes the thyroid gland to make too much thyroid hormone. graves' disease like many thyroid problems often runs in families. other common causes include: thyroid nodules. thyroid nodules are abnormal growths in the thyroid gland that can make too much thyroid hormone. for more information see the topic thyroid nodules. thyroiditis. thyroiditis occurs when your body makes antibodies that damage your thyroid gland. you can also get thyroiditis from a viral or bacterial infection. at first thyroiditis may cause your thyroid levels to rise as hormone leaks out from the damaged gland. later levels may be low ( hypothyroidism ) until the gland repairs itself. uncommon causes of hyperthyroidism include tumors or eating foods or taking medicines that contain large amounts of iodine. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

in order for you to be properly diagnosed you would need to see a medical provider for an examination and possibly some imaging studies. appendicitis would be listed among the many possibilities to account for anyone's abdominal pain but be advised that their are many. since you have been symptomatic for five days now it is time for you to get some hands-on answers.
the health care provider will try to find the underlying illness that is causing the symptoms of nausea and vomiting. at the same time steps will be taken to treat the symptoms and prevent dehydration. any testing will likely be directed to finding the underlying diagnosis. however blood tests may be taken to assess whether the electrolyte balance in the body has been disturbed due to dehydration from continued vomiting. a urinalysis may be done. concentrated urine is associated with dehydration as the kidneys try to hold onto water in the body. ketones in the urine are also a sign of dehydration.
get off webmd and go see a medical professional immediately. this could be a serious medical emergency.

i am not aware of any medical condition that would cause his hair to immediately change from black to reddish-brown in this short period of time. it may be wise to have him medically-evaluated however.
ovaries are not surgically removed and then put back. ovarian cysts are on the outside of the ovaries in most cases so only the cyst is remove. your ovarian cysts should have nothing to do with your thyroid problem but that would require a thorough investigation by your endocrinologist.
"you don't have to ""break a fever"" in children. fever is beneficial and is helping him fight off an infection. a fever of 103 does not cause harm. dehydration is a different issue so it is important for him to drink fluids. as long as he has tears and his mouth is moist inside he is probably doing fine. fevers from viral infections for instance can last 3-4 days the reason to seek medical care would be the cough. simple colds (viral infections) can definitely cause a fever and cough but so can influenza and pneumonia. if you are concerned that this illness is something more than a viral infection then you would need to have him properly examined by a medical professional. while you don't have to worry about fever or even treat it you do need to make him comfortable so if ibuprofen or acetaminophen makes him feel better then use it."

"the answer to your question is ""yes and no. "" each individual physician sets his or her own criteria under which he or she will perform a procedure. for example a dermatologist might be willing to surgically remove a mole from your face right in the exam room while a plastic surgeon may require you to have it done in an operating room. it's possible you will find a doctor who is willing to perform a colonoscopy without iv sedation. however iv sedation is the standard today and you will tolerate the discomfort of the colonoscopy better with a little sedation on board. i'm not sure why you're unwilling to get an iv. when i was an operating room nurse many of my patients expressed severe needle anxiety that made starting an iv difficult for them. if this is the case for you please know you can receive oral sedation before the iv start. this usually makes the process tolerable for even the most needle-phobic person. wishing you well!"
frequency of urination and dysuria (pain on urination) are two signs of a urinary tract infection. another would be blood in the urine but since you are spotting this may not be noticed or obvious. since urinary tract infections can be caused by sexual activity and you have been trying to get pregnant i think it would be wise to have a urinalysis and a urine culture. it may be a bit too early to see if you are pregnant.
"allergic reactions are uncommon. hyaluronic acid fillers are made from substances similar to those found in your body. but if you are allergic to lidocaine used to numb the pain during injections, tell your doctor before your treatment."
"it would be best not to take any ""cillins"". some childhood amoxicillin reactions were not allergic however even though they may have caused a rash. an allergist can test you for penicillin (and other ""cillin"" allergies so you would know for sure."
clinically his vital signs. blood pressure and diabetic control are the factors to decide surgery plus kidney and liver functions. not the age i mean. radiation therapy is the choice if surgery is not applicable.

as you know i have no way of examining your eyes over the internet but it is not uncommon for anyone (including someone who is pregnant) to break a small blood vessel in the eye from throwing up. you may have a subconjunctival hemorrhage. these can look absolutely frightening but they are no more serious than a bruise on your knee and will resolve in a week or so. bright red at first then brownish and then back to normal. again this is really a guess since i can't see your eye so if you are worried or concerned please consult your medical provider.

an epidural steroid injection is a common procedure to treat spinal nerve irritation that is caused by tissues next to the nerve pressing against it. the beginning of the nerve (nerve root) is most often irritated by an inflamed intervertebral disc or disc contents directly touching the spinal nerve. an epidural steroid injection involves bathing an inflamed nerve root in steroids (potent anti-inflammation medicine) in order to decrease the irritation of the nerve root that is causing pain.
in my opinion you should not wait early intervention with surgical excision is necessary and then you will need to get radiation and chemotherapy for some time to confirm the end of the growth of the tumor. if you are at the early stages then it is treatable. feel better soon.
hi the itch at the tip of your penis could have been from all the soap you was using and the pain in your testicles could be just a strain from to much sex or something you did at work if this pain slowly goes away then that's what it was and the sore tip will or should just fad away. good luck

the sperm doesn't even reach the egg for a day or two so a little spotting the next day is either the start of a period or the result of a little tiny tear. definitely get yourself tested if that will help you feel better. stress can also cause irregular periods as can diet so it's not just your weight. best of luck!
theoretically you can transfer a type one herpes virus (the cold sore) to your own genitals during the first (primary) infection when the viral shedding was very high and your immune system was very vulnerable but. that is not very likely. i have to say that the way you probably got genital herpes the old fashioned way: through sexual contact. auto-innoculation (giving it to yourself) is something that is biologically possible but extremely rare. i have never seen it. some people with herpes are surprisingly oblivious. i have conclusively diagnosed many people with herpes who thought they just had a rash or a sore area from the rubbing of clothing. it is even possible and scientifically proven that herpes can be transmitted even when the partner does not have an active or obvious outbreak. most of the people who get herpes were not aware that they were exposed since their partner  sometimes their only partner did not have a clue they had it. will you have it for life? yes unfortunately but the number of outbreaks could be quite infrequent (or not). the body's immune systems usually does a great job keeping herpes at bay. you should inform any partner that you have it regardless. there are some good antiviral drugs if taken regularly that can reduce the outbreak incidences and the amount of viral shedding that could affect others. talk to your medical provider about it.
of course you need a check. a mri of brain is important to early detect any abnormality. do you have neck pain?
if you are worried about an std then go to a clinic and get tested once and for all. there is nothing worse than worry and this way you will know one way or another. if the tests come back negative then you have some sort of skin irritation. the best thing for this is a penis health creme called man1 man oil. apply it once a day and it will go away for sure. good luck to you.
i have had that problem. i ended up going to the doctor and found out it was heartburn and gerd.
i think she should follow her doctors orders. every single detail! and if she does this after giving herself time to heal properly her beautiful singing voice will get more beautiful & turn into a much stronger purer and more open sounding instrument. i've had my tonsils and adnoids removed so this was my own life experience with this particular problem as i was also getting strep three to five times every winter! after the surgery i never got strep again.

it depends on the quality of your current diet. some pescatarians eat dairy and others don't. if you don't eat dairy vitamin d and calcium are of concern. even if you do eat dairy it is likely you need vitamin d unless you are having fatty fish every day. you don't have to worry about omega-3 (dha and epa) if you are having fatty fish twice a week. you need to be sure you are getting enough iron and zinc but with careful planning it shouldn't be a problem. in short a well-balanced pescatarian diet can supply most of the nutrients you need (except d which is low in food). this article can help you make the right choices. of course you can always take a multivitamin if you feel you diet is inadequate.
hi heres 3 links that may help you with you problem does seem to be overlooked.  #/non-epileptic-attacksblackout/4533052168  just copy one at a time into google to the www. to open read. hope these help. good luck
never get scared of these things. if at all happens for a ringworm to enter your body you need not be panic of these things. there are hell lot of effective treatments done in hospitals for ailing these.
you will need to see your urologist. you could be having retrograde ejaculations. this is where the ejaculation goes into the bladder instead of out of the end of your penis. this could be due to the chronic prostatitis that blocked your urine flow.
this could be a condition called folliculitis due to friction and sweating. it may help to use a cleanser with salicylic acid and a topical antibiotic afterwards such as clindamycin gel (this is a prescription product).
i think what you may have read is its better to get nutrients from food because of the other health benefits such as fiber and antioxidants. it's true that you will likely absorb more from food because the nutrients are not provided in one dose like a multivitamin. for example calcium is better absorbed when giving through out the day instead of one big dose. it would be impossible to put together a drink with food that had 100% daily value of vitamins and minerals like a multivitamin has. instead work to get the recommended amount of food in your daily diet. smoothies with fruits vegetables and yogurt can help you meet your produce goal (5 or more daily). to figure out your needs based on your indiviual needs go to choosemyplate. gov
it seems to be a pre-cancerous mole if not cancerous. a biopsy and a histopathology study of the lesion will help you confirm about this. a laser treatment will be beneficial in treating it effectively. do not apply anything warm /hot over the mole.

you will not qualify for medicare until you are 65 as well. you may need to get insurance through the health care marketplace (obamacare) or through a private insurance company. for about 18 months you will qualify of cobra coverage through your husband's insurance but cobra tends to be very pricy. actually all health policies often come with a sticker shock. i am currently paying a bit of $800 for just me for cobra coverage since i will not turn 65 until may. my wife is older and covered under medicare so if there were more cost-effective options i would have jumped on it. sadly we are at the mercy of an overpriced health care and insurance system.
new health plans must cover outpatient and inpatient care and other services likely used to treat carpal tunnel. i would need to know more details about your plan but i'm guessing it doesn't meet with the law's basic requirements. if that's the case you may be required to change plans. however if your plan isn't providing coverage for the care you need you may be better off shopping for a new one through your state's health insurance marketplace. you can find information about how to do that at healthcare. gov.
here's a longer preview of my question with details: hi i'm a 20 year old with a very strange pulse and sometimes very very light chest pain near my armpit/breast area. my bmi is 38 (currently working on lowering) i exercise at least 4 times a week; about an 1 hour of 4-5 miles. note that i've been doing this type of regular exercise since i was 11 and some days would exercise with my partner for nearly 2 hours almost 2 times a month. i've been working on eating correctly as well (oats fruit no processed foods/sugars). i've recently quit caffeine and diet sodas replacing them with 4 or more glasses of water. my blood pressure is 134/81. usually my resting heart rate ranges from 74-80 bpm. my problem is during 2 weeks i've been experiencing high pulse rates from (94-104) and on some days a single heart flutter. sometimes during sleeping i wake with strange high pulses. a few days ago i've awaken from a deep dreaming sleep having two heart flutters and freaked out. near the end of the day i get these weird stingy/squeezy chest pains that occur near my left breast very close to the armpit. sometimes i get the same pain at the same spot in my right chest but it's much lighter than the left. my leg elbows of my arms and stomach would also have very mild/light pains that pulsate but disappear after a while. this happens when i'm resting but not when i exercise. they last from 2-20 seconds and disappear or reoccur slightly when in bed. the day before this past halloween i visited a doctor at a clinic and she basically laughed at me saying i was too paranoid and having anxiety. she checked my heart beat and breathing through a stethoscope but no more after that. she said i was too young to be having heart problems. i'm afraid of going back due to spending way too much money just to hear the same reply. this is starting to scare me and i'm very hesitant to return to my regular exercise and weight training since this has been happening. i don't think i have diabetes since i don't get the symptoms (and i'm like a hawk keeping an eye on any similar rising symptoms if i get them). should i continue with my daily activities? how about suggested foods to eat in a single day for healthy heart function? again i don't eat a lot of sugars. thank you.
there are no real advantages or disadvantages. it is just a less-common blood type.
how athlete's foot (tinea pedis) develops and how well it responds to treatment depends on the type of athlete's foot you have. toe web infection (interdigital) toe web infections (interdigital) often begin with skin that seems moist and pale white. you may notice itching burning and a slight odor. as the infection gets worse the skin between the toes becomes scaly peels and cracks. if the fungal infection becomes severe a bacterial infection also may develop. this can cause further skin breakdown. the bacterial infection may also infect the lower leg ( cellulitis of the lower leg). toe web infections often result in a sudden vesicular (blister) infection. toe web infections respond well to treatment. moccasin-type infection moccasin-type infections may begin with minor irritation dryness itching burning or scaly skin and progress to thickened cracked skin on the sole or heel. in severe cases the toenails become infected and can thicken crumble and even fall out. if you do not take preventive measures this infection often returns. you may also develop an infection on the palm of the hand (symptoms commonly affect one hand and both feet). moccasin-type infections may be long-lasting (chronic) and are very difficult to treat. vesicular infection vesicular infections ( blisters ) usually begin with a sudden outbreak of blisters that become red and inflamed. blisters occasionally erupt again after the initial infection. a bacterial infection may also be present. a vesicular infection often develops from a long-lasting toe web infection. blisters may also appear on palms the side of the fingers and other areas (dermatophytid or id reaction). vesicular infections usually respond well to treatment. complications if untreated skin blisters and cracks caused by athlete's foot can lead to severe bacterial infections. in some types of athlete's foot the toenails may be infected. for more information see the topic fungal nail infections. all types of athlete's foot can be treated but symptoms often return after treatment. athlete's foot is most likely to return if: you don't take preventive measures and are again exposed to fungi that cause athlete's foot. you don't use antifungal medicine for the prescribed length of time and the fungi are not completely killed. the fungi are not completely killed even after the full course of medicine. severe infections that appear suddenly and keep returning can lead to long-lasting infection. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information.

you ask a great question and i wish i had a great answer. there is no product that can thicken up your skin so that you don't bruise as easily. sorry. of course you can use makeup to cover up some bruises but realistically speaking it's not that feasible to wear makeup on your hands and arms. obviously the regular use of blood-thinning agents like aspirin or ibuprofen can increase bruising but don't stop taking aspirin if your doctor told you to take it for heart health. some products can cause the skin to become thinner like topical corticosteroids. avoid using these products unless absolutely necessary. in the privacy of your home you may wish to start wearing gloves more frequently. gloves can act like an extra layer of skin and protect you from getting bruised due to a minor bump or scrape. you may want to consult a dermatologist to learn if there are any new products or treatments to address the issue of paper-thin skin and easy bruising. wishing you well!
talk to your health care provider about your chances for getting osteoporosis. many things put people at risk for osteoporosis. the following people have a higher chance of getting osteoporosis: women who: are going through or who are past menopause (the change). are white (caucasian) or asian. people who: are thin. have a family member with osteoporosis. do not get enough calcium or vitamin d. do not exercise. smoke. drink alcohol often. take bone-thinning medicines (such as prednisone) for a long time.

"pertussis, or whooping cough, is an extremely contagious respiratory infection that can lead to severe breathing problems, especially in infants. pertussis first appears like an ordinary cold, but then causes intense, uncontrollable coughing spells. you'll hear a ""whoop"" noise when you try to take a breath after coughing."
there is no crystal clear roadmap for women who are bipolar and pregnant. that's because few studies have been done on bipolar disorder and pregnancy. not enough is known about the risks of untreated bipolar disorder or the risks and benefits of medications. and the factors that lead to relapse during pregnancy are not entirely clear. the symptoms of bipolar disorder however can worsen during pregnancy. pregnant women or new mothers with bipolar disorder have seven times the risk of hospital admissions compared with pregnant women who do not have bipolar disorder. a 2007 study on bipolar and pregnancy has shed further light. and it has called into question a common belief that pregnancy may have a protective effect for women with bipolar disorder. the study followed 89 women through pregnancy and one year after delivery. when stopping bipolar medications six months before conception to 12 weeks after women had: twice the risk of relapse. a 50% risk of recurrence within just two weeks if they stopped suddenly. (women who had unplanned pregnancies were more likely to stop at once. ) bipolar symptoms throughout 40% of the pregnancy  or more than four times that experienced by women who continued their bipolar medications.
the healing of a fractured bone depends on many factors. 1. type of fracture - compound fractures - take much longer to heal. 2. displaced bone fragments - if the bone edges and parts have been displaced then the risk of delayed union and nonunion increase. 3. infection - increases the healing time. 4. disruption of the blood flow to the fracture site - also hampers healing 5. malnutrition bone disorders also prolong the healing time. 6. early mobilization of the joint - before complete healing. in your case you have 2 or more factors which have caused the delay in your recovery. without first hand knowledge of your current condition examination of your xrays and a physical examination it would not be possible to give exact possibility of your prognosis. i am sorry about that. but platelet rich plasma (prp) does contain important cytokines and growth factors which when injected into a injured area helps to improve the rate of healing (bone formation in your case) and hence your recovery. as mentioned in your history you may already might have had some progress. hence if the fractured bone site heals completely (which will eventually happen in due time) - there is no doubt that you will be able to walk normally on the affected foot. i hope this helps.
no not if you urinated between the time you masturbated and when you had sex. sperm will die as soon as it dries but you want to make sure your pre-cum isn't carrying any live sperm. if you urinate though usually that flushes the urethra. still you are playing with fire and asking for trouble. at the very least invest in some condoms.
"there is no thing called ""average"" when it comes to a person. or a person who has knee surgery. every person on this planet is different when it comes to their ability to deal with pain and not all knee surgeries (or the surgeon performing them) are the same either. so there are no ""average times"" for pain duration. the only person that could give you a rough estimate would be the surgeon who did the procedure  someone who is familiar with the case and someone who knows what kind of surgery that was done."
an infection thought to be susceptable to azithromycin. there are no specific diseases that you could determine based solely on a drug or dosage.
condoms are about 85% effective for birth control. with careful use they are even more effective. keep in mind that the best way to avoid getting pregnant is to not have sex (abstinence).
