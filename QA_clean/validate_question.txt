had prostate removed due to cancer 20 years ago when i was 44. have had a few issues with erectile dysfunction however with viagra cialis or levitra i'm able to get a great erection. my problem is with the dry orgasm (or should i say lack of orgasm). for the first year or so after the surgery i could barely tell if i was having an orgasm. it has since got a little better but absolutely nothing like it was before when i ejaculated and after 20 years it just seems like it continues to dwindle. i have a very high sex drive (testosterone was recently checked and it is abnormally high for someone my age) but my orgasms are hardly worth the effort anymore. is there anything you can recommend that would or could improve the quality of my dry orgasms? i realize they'll never ever be the same as they were before without ejaculating but i've talked with other men who have had radical prostatectomies and they don't seem to have any complaints or have this lack of sensation.

during a routine pap smear i requested hiv and std testing. all my std tests came back negative but the p24 antigen part of the ag/ab combo test came back reactive while the antibody test was negative. i then had a pcr test conducted on a new blood sample and the results were negative/nonreactive. i then had another ag/ab combo test performed where the p24 antigen and antibody test were both negative. 3 months later my doctor ordered another ab/ag combo test. the results were the same as the very first test p24 antigen negative/antibody negative. at this point i've been told by a pathologist that the positive tests are false and that my body must produce something that looks like the p24 antigen to the test. on the other hand my gyno wants me to go to an infections control specialist. i am so confused and i don't know what to do. i don't know how to definitively get an answer.

can mild but prolonged eye irritation(like an eyelash poking)cause a migraine? . about 2 months ago i had an eyelash poking my right eye that has since been removed. since then my eye is still irritated. i get a sensation that there is something in my eye. i also get headaches/pulsating feeling on my right temple. very sensitive to light and any type of tv or computer screen. i have seen an eye dr and regular dr. they said my eye looks great- no problems. could the eye irritation have caused a migraine which is now irritating my eye? any suggestions would help. thanks
