my husband and i are trying to have a baby. i was 10 days late for my period. and today i'm spotting. pregnant? . i took a test 6 days ago and it was negative. any info would be greatly appreciated.,i'd suggest you take another home pregnancy test. and do it first thing in the morning when your urine is most concentrated. your spotting could indeed be implantation bleeding. or it could be the arrival of your period. only the home pregnancy test can tell for sure! if you take another pregnancy test that comes up negative but you fail to have a regular period i suggest you consult a gynecologist to find out what's going on. a number of factors could cause you to skip a period and yet not be pregnant. your gynecologist can sort through the possibilities and figure out what's going on. wishing you all the best for a positive test!,"['period', 'pregnancy', 'baby', 'spotting']",wmd

(assuming you had an x-ray initially. ) i know it's hard to be patient but keep in mind that trying to rush the healing process can actually aggravate the injury  which will take even longer to heal. i wish you all the best!,[],wmd

i had a laceration dermabonded at hospital. dermabond came off and the cut is open. can it be reglued to prevent scar? . the laceration is shallow but its on my shoulder so it naturally pulls apart. the the nurse told me that it would be fine if i showered with the dermabond on my shoulder but he turned out to be wrong. the glue softened and the wound opened. unfortunalty i did not notice right away because of all the scabbing. today (5 days after the dermabond came off) the large scab fell off in the shower and i can see that the cut is wide open. can i reseal it so i dont end up with a huge scar?,most helpful answer no. this cannot be re-glued (or sutured) after five days unless the wound is re-cut. you are most likely going to be stuck with a scar as this wound must heal naturally now. this is why i hate and never use dermabond especially in an area where there is tension. dermabond is for lazy medical providers and those who are not skilled in suturing. it has a place but in very very few situations. suturing is almost always a better choice. i am very sorry that happened to you and that you were given the improper instructions (dermabond should not get wet in a shower). scars can be improved by plastic surgery so if you are cosmetically scarred in about a year this may be what you have to do. the body has a remarkable ability to repair damage however so things may look fine a year from now. go back to the hospital,"['scar', 'wound', 'shoulder', 'vision']",wmd

what is chemotherapy for prostate cancer?,chemotherapeutic agents or chemotherapy are anticancer drugs. they are used (for hormone resistant prostate cancer) as a palliative treatment (palliation to relieve symptoms) in patients with advanced cancer for whom a cure is unattainable. recall that the goal of palliation is simply to slow the tumor's growth and relieve the patient's symptoms. chemotherapy is not ordinarily used for organ-confined or locally advanced prostate cancers because a cure in these cases is possible with other treatments. currently chemotherapy is used only for advanced metastatic prostate cancers that have failed to respond to other treatments. several chemotherapeutic agents have been used effectively to palliate metastatic prostate cancer. one such agent is estramustine (emcyt). another agent called mitoxantrone (novantrone) has been shown to be effective in combination with prednisone for palliating androgen-independent prostate cancer. as mentioned previously metastatic tumors that have not responded specifically to hormonal therapy are referred to as castrate-resistant prostate cancers. newer chemotherapy medicines like docetaxel (taxotere) have shown some promise in prolonging the survival of some patients with extensive prostate cancer. they may also decrease the pain related to widespread cancer. however this comes at the cost of significant side effects that may impact quality of life. the more common side effects of chemotherapy include weakness nausea hair loss and suppression of the bone marrow. the suppression of marrow in turn can decrease the red blood cells (causing anemia) the white blood cells (leading to infections) and the platelets (resulting in bleeding).,"['chemotherapy', 'prostate cancer']",wmd

how long can the flu live in your home. my son has the flu how long until it is safe for my other children and grandchildren to come into my home?,because people with the flu are contagious while they are ill and that they tend to be most contagious while they have a fever cdc advises people who are sick with flu to stay home and away from others for at least 24 hours until after their fever is gone (without the use of fever-reducing medicines). if a sick person is around others we advise that they cover their cough and everyone washes their hands frequently. most flu is spread directly from a sick person to another person. while flu viruses can be spread by surfaces contaminated with flu viruses (such as by coughing on them) this is probably not a very efficient way to spread the virus. studies have shown that human influenza viruses generally can survive on surfaces between 2 and 8 hours in usual conditions.,['flu'],wmd

how long does it take medication to enter your blood stream. how does it take a oxycodone 30 to enter your blood stream.,"the general answer to your question is: it depends on the medication. every drug works differently. i think what you're referring to is the ""peak concentration"" point sometimes called the point of ""peak effectiveness. "" that's the point in time at which a medication is most concentrated in your bloodstream. in the case of oxycodone the medication is released almost immediately after you take it. it reaches peak effectiveness within a couple of hours and then gradually tapers off over the course of about 24 hours. always follow the dosing instructions on any bottle of narcotics like oxycodone. if you take too much oxycodone you can stop breathing. obviously that's bad. if you have any questions about your prescription medications you can always call a pharmacist. many pharmacies are open 24 hours a day and a pharmacist will be happy to answer any questions you have about how to take your medications. hope this helps!",['oxycodone'],wmd

why would a person's lungs explode. my brother was on a ventilator and for 3 weeks he recently had trac surgery. 2days after surgery his lungs exploded. how can that happen?,i imagine you are talking about a condition called pneumothorax. the lung isn't literally exploding but a hole forms in the lung and in the lining of the lung. air can then escape out into the area surrounding the lung. the problem is this air outside the lungs puts pressure on the lungs. the lungs then can't expand and fill with oxygen. that can make getting enough oxygen in the body very difficult. when people are on a ventilator the machine is pushing air into the lungs so the chance of this happening is always higher. that's because of the pressure that can build up in the lungs. while the respiratory therapist and the doctors adjust the machine to keep the pressures down as much as possible this can still happen. the longer someone is on a ventilator the more likely problems such as this are likely to occur.,"['lung', 'surgery']",wmd

how great is the risk of spreading herpes type i through oral sex? . i've been getting cold sores for most of my life. my girlfriend was concerned about it spreading through oral sex so she consulted her gyno. she was told to never allow me to do it to her as i am pretty much always shedding the disease. i feel like this will put a major hit on the relationship so i was wondering if the risk really is that big?,unfortunately yes the risk really is that big. even if you're not having an active outbreak of cold sores you're still infected with the herpes simplex i virus (hsv i) which causes the cold sores. this virus can be transmitted through any physical contact including kissing. the problem with hsv i and genitalia is that increasing evidence shows hsv i can cause genital herpes. both of these viruses are incurable and your girlfriend is rightfully concerned about being infected with a lifelong case of genital herpes by your performing oral sex on her. i wish i could offer a good solution to your problem. the only safe way for you to perform oral sex on your girlfriend is with a barrier in place. you could look into the female condom to see if it provides enough coverage for you to avoid skin-to-skin contact between your mouth and her genitalia (including the clitoris). otherwise your best bet is to avoid oral sex altogether. remember however that oral sex is just one way to pleasure your partner. if the lack of oral sex is a deal-breaker for your girlfriend then she's not the girl for you. take care!,"['sexual intercourse', 'cold sore', 'herpes']",wmd

how can i stop sneak eating?,have you had a history of sneak eating? here are seven steps to help you stomp out sneak eating: 1. examine your eating habits. what are your sneak eating rituals? how do you sneak eat? what kinds of foods do you choose? when youre done overeating what do you do with the wrappers or evidence of sneak eating? when are you most likely to curtail your eating because you feel youll be judged? what triggers send you flying into your secret sneak eating rituals? look at the last time this occurred to you and seek out the connections between trigger and reaction. late-night eating has a particular air of sneakiness. its dark out no ones around just you and your sneak food. how do you feel at that time? make connections. 2. write it down. the best way to look at patterns and make connections is to journal it. just whip out a computer or spiral-bound notebook and with absolute honestly write down what you eat when and under what circumstances. reading your journal usually is a real eye-opener. 3. savor dont sneak. if you feel like youre sneaking food youll scarf up food so fast youll get whiplash. stop. ask yourself: what was i thinking before i decided to sneak eat?  make connections between events emotions and actions. youre not going to truly savor and enjoy food you need to eat behind others backs. instead youre reacting to something that has occurred in your life. the goal is to savor every morsel of food not to secretly stuff it into your mouth and feel nothing but remorse guilt and shame. 4. focus on your strengths. heres where we do lots of body image work. look at your body. you have tremendous strengths there and you need to take pride in them. write down your strengths. what can your body do well? the next time you feel bad about your body whip out your laundry list of positive things you love about your body and neutralize the negative thoughts that send you into a sneak eating binge. 5. optimize your healthy lifestyle habits. to improve your body image you need to do the work to eat healthfully as well as stay physically active. living a healthy lifestyle lays down the foundation for the elimination of sneak eating. be patient. people whove been sneak eating for a long time will have to be patient with the process of eliminating this habit. old self-destructive patterns take time to be replaced with healthier progressive lifestyle habits. 6. make a commitment. if you feel that youre about to sneak eat you probably are. eating should not be accompanied by guilt and shame. make a commitment to spend the next 24 hours eating healthfully and fight the urge to take food into a secret place where you eat sneak foods. start out with a healthy breakfast and eat every 3-4 hours after that. make certain youre eating a balance of high quality protein carbs (veggies fruit whole grain) and fat. stop eating by 8 p. m. each night. get physical activity. if youre feeling stressed and anxious seek other ways to alleviate the angst. these include activities that do not involve sneak eating or self destruction (meditate breathe yoga read a book call a friend take a walk). write down your commitment and take it day by day. each successful day is a powerful experience that will help you to build a strong foundation for healthy living. 7. get help. since sneak eating is associated with body image issues sometimes we need to get help and guidance with understanding how to come to peace with our body. there are licensed social workers and psychologists who can provide the expertise youll need to achieve your goals. sneak eating is an outward manifestation of inner turmoil about your body and yourself. gift yourself with the daily patience and practice to resolve this challenge. come out of hiding. you deserve to sit up proudly at the table and savor your food and life. you can stomp out sneak eating once and for all.,[],wmd

what causes a migraine with aura?,scientists aren't sure what causes migraines with aura. it's thought that at least two brain chemicals  serotonin and dopamine  play a role. according to the theory something goes awry in the way these chemicals regulate brain function. this may cause the brain and the body's immune system to overreact. when this happens a flood of immune response cells flows through the blood vessels to the brain. the brain's blood vessels open wider to accommodate these cells. even more chemicals are released to help control the vessels' muscles. the vessels open and constrict. a severe often throbbing headache results. factors suspected of causing migraines with aura include genetics and being overweight. substances behaviors and environment may trigger migraines as well. it is known that migraines often run in families. they frequently begin in childhood and worsen through adolescence. although more boys than girls have migraines more adult women than adult men have migraines. over time the number of migraines lessen and they become rare after age 50. whatever the cause the good news is that  although painful  migraines with aura are not life threatening.,['migraine'],wmd

what should i know about osteoporosis?,normally your bones are being rebuilt all the time. first old bone is removed (resorbed). then a similar amount of new bone is formed. this balanced process keeps your skeleton healthy and strong. osteoporosis is a thinning and weakening of the bones. it is common in women after menopause and may also occur in men. in osteoporosis bone is removed faster than it is formed so overall bone mass is lost and bones become weaker. therefore keeping bone mass is important to keep your bones healthy. in both men and women osteoporosis may also be caused by certain medicines called corticosteroids. at first osteoporosis usually has no symptoms but it can cause fractures (broken bones). fractures usually cause pain. fractures of the bones of the spine may not be painful but over time they can make you shorter. eventually your spine can curve and your body can become bent over. fractures may happen during normal everyday activity such as lifting or from minor injury that would normally not cause bones to break. fractures most often occur at the hip spine or wrist. this can lead to pain severe disability or loss of ability to move around (mobility).,['osteoporosis'],wmd

what causes cataracts?,"the lens lies behind the iris and the pupil. it works much like a camera lens. it focuses light onto the retina at the back of the eye where an image is recorded. the lens also adjusts the eye's focus letting us see things clearly both up close and far away. the lens is made of mostly water and protein. the protein is arranged in a precise way that keeps the lens clear and lets light pass through it. but as we age some of the protein may clump together and start to cloud a small area of the lens. this is a cataract. over time the cataract may grow larger and cloud more of the lens making it harder to see. researchers suspect that there are several causes of cataracts such as smoking and diabetes. or it may be that the protein in the lens just changes from the wear and tear it takes over the years. the term ""age-related"" is a little misleading. you don't have to be a senior citizen to get this type of cataract. in fact people can have an age-related cataract in their 40s and 50s. but during middle age most cataracts are small and do not affect vision. it is after age 60 that most cataracts steal vision. who is at risk for cataracts? the risk of cataract increases as you get older. other risk factors for cataracts include: certain diseases such as diabetes. personal behavior such as smoking and alcohol use. the environment such as prolonged exposure to sunlight. wearing sunglasses and a hat with a brim to block ultraviolet sunlight may help to delay cataracts. if you smoke stop. researchers also believe good nutrition can help reduce the risk of age-related cataracts. they recommend eating green leafy vegetables fruit and other foods with antioxidants. if you are age 60 or older you should have a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once every two years. in addition to cataracts your eye care professional can check for signs of age-related macular degeneration glaucoma and other vision disorders. early treatment for many eye diseases may save your sight.",['cataract'],wmd

will a nail grow back if it came out completely due to an injury? . my son smashed his index finger between two dumb bell weights on monday. he nearly severed the tip and now has 11 stiches.,"good news! here is an article on nail problems and injuries that contains the following statement along with a lot of other great information: "" separation from the nail bed. once your nail separates from its nail bed for whatever reason it will not reattach. nails grow back slowly. it takes about 6 months for fingernails and up to 18 months for toenails to grow back attached to the nail bed. "" the webmd answers staff usually but you had quite a crush injury. the body has a remarkable ability to re-grow a lost or damaged nail assuming the matrix (the base of the nail that has the cells needed to regenerate the nail) has not been damaged. a damaged matrix may cause the nail to grow back somewhat deformed or have a ridge. when we lose a finger we do not grow a new one but when we lose a nail the body likes to replace it. time will tell if your nail re-grows again and comes in normally. my son just had the same accident. so i'm curious since its been a little over a year. has your sons nail grown back?","['injury', 'index finger', 'nail', 'weight', 'stitches']",wmd

air comes out of my tear duct when i blow my nose. its been happening for a few months now but when i laugh or blow my nose air comes out on my right tear duct. what causes that? why is there air or anything coming out out my eye other than tears and eye boogers? its a little uncomfortable and i would love to know why this is happening. thank in advance!,that is the nasolacrimal duct that drains tears from your eyes into your nose. when you peel onions your eyes will water and your nose will run. when you cry your nose will run. this duct goes two ways so it is possible to have air come through when you blow your nose. this is innocent and there is really nothing you can do to correct this normal phenomena unless you want a surgeon to close this duct. then of course the tears will run down our cheek. not a good solution. though it's rare it is possible for air to come out through there. the reason why is because the tear ducts are actually connected to the top of your nasal cavity. normally when you cry some of your tears actually flow down into your nose - one of the reasons why our noses run sometimes when we cry. since it's all connected anyway you probably just have slightly larger passages between the two areas.,"['tear duct', 'nose', 'eyes']",wmd

i have pigmentation on my upper lip. i am taking birth control pills. help! i look like i have a mustache.,i see this everyday in my practice and it's a real problem. this is a condition that's most likely called melasma. we used to only see it in pregnant women but what happens now is that when women take the pill and the longer they take the pill; so it's almost any contraceptive whether it's a patch or a pill that contains hormones the longer you are on that and then when you combine that with even minimal sun exposure can cause a patchy discoloration usually symmetric on the cheeks or upper lip and even on the forehead. this gets darker in the summer often fades in the winter but on the upper lip especially can look like a mustache and women just hate this. so it's important to understand the underlying cause it's hormones and sun exposure either from being on the pill or just your own natural hormones or during pregnancy. then the other part is the sun that you really have to protect against. when i say protect i don't mean if you are going to the beach. if you are just going to walk on the street get your newspaper from the corner go to the bus stop you have to have adequate protection on. wear a hat if you can try to stay in the shade when you can. this condition can be treated but it can often be difficult to treat. what we use are things like hydroquinones or ingredients that have sepiwhite or mulberry root extract or liquorice extract those are ingredients you can look for on products and as dermatologists we can also do treatments in the office. there are certain chemical peels that we can do that can help target that pigment in a very specific way and help lighten it. but if you go in the sun it will come right back.,"['lip', 'birth control pill']",wmd

what surgical procedures are used to treat heart failure?,"surgery is aimed at stopping further damage to the heart and improving the heart's function. procedures used include: left ventricular assist device (lvad): the lvad helps your heart pump blood throughout your body. it allows you to be mobile sometimes returning home to await a heart transplant. bypass surgery : the most common surgery for heart failure is bypass surgery to circumvent a blocked heart artery. heart valve surgery : as heart failure progresses the heart valves that normally help direct the flow of blood through the heart to the rest of the body stretch out of shape allowing blood to ""leak"" backwards. the valves can be repaired or replaced. infarct exclusion surgery (modified dor or dor procedure): when a heart attack occurs in the left ventricle (left lower pumping chamber of the heart) a scar forms. the scarred area is thin and can bulge out with each beat (an aneurysm). a heart surgeon can remove the dead heart tissue or the aneurysm. heart transplant: a heart transplant is considered when heart failure is so severe that it does not respond to all other therapies but the person's health is otherwise good.",['congestive heart failure'],wmd
tapering geodon? . in june replaced my meds with latuda 40 mg. i still stuck on to geodon for sleep. but went from 40 mg to 20 mg in liquid form and have been tapering the liquid form gradually. today i take 11 mg geodon with 40 mg latuda. i want to be off of geodon by end of this year. . so i am consulting you to see if you have experience with such low dose of geodon. is it even having its effects on my sleep? . pease tell me anything because i want to decrease to 10 mg in 2 days.,"i hope you told your doctor you did not stop the geodon ( ziprasidone hcl) when you switched over to latuda ( lurasidone hcl). because both of these medications are in a class called ""atypical antipsychotics "" it means they both work in a similar fashion. when you take both of them at the same time it has an effect not unlike doubling the dosage. taking too much of these types of medications can cause serious side effects. i urge you to contact your doctor before you do any more tapering of the geodon dose. your healthcare provider needs this information in order to treat you appropriately if you experience any side effects from reducing the geodon dosage. if you're having trouble sleeping your healthcare provider should address that as a separate issue. you should not self-medicate your sleep issues by taking medications not prescribed for that purpose. wishing you well!",['vision'],wmd

natural cures for depression? . hi all! . are there any natural/holistic remedies for treating the blues? i am looking for a job and staying as busy as i can with factoring in time for activities i enjoy - reading exercise etc. i googled my request but there was so much information that i decided to ask on webmd. so here i am:. what would be some of natural/holistic cures for depression?,i am very biased towards exercise. in fact some studies have shown that exercise works as good or better than antidepressants for mild to moderate depression. i know with a busy lifestyle it can be difficult to find time for exercise. we often think in terms of being unable to find time for exercise. instead we should turn our thinking around so that we're making time for exercise. even if it's 20 minutes a day the benefits will more than pay off. 10 minutes in the morning and 10 minutes in the evening can even do the trick if that's all the time you have. ideally 30 minutes of steady exercise a few days a week is best. here's more information on how truly wonderful exercise can be for depression. if you're interested in supplements there are several that medical research has shown to be effective. the supplements that have the most evidence to support them are same and st. john's wort. studies have shown that same may work as well as antidepressants. the studies in this area aren't great but the supplement certainly shows promise. there is a lot of research showing st. john's wort can help as well as some antidepressants. it's been shown to improve mood and anxiety and improve sleep related to depression. another possibility is 5-htp which again has been shown in some studies to work as well as certain antidepressants. if you are already on an antidepressant you should definitely talk to your doctor before taking any supplement to make sure there are no drug interactions. of course if you haven't seen a doctor about your depression you absolutely should. you want to make sure that is in fact what's going on and that you're getting the right treatment based on your depression. everyone is different and you and your doctor know your body the best. the two of you can work together to tackle your depression.,"['depression', 'exercise']",wmd
will i need less sleep as i age?,you have to remember is that people who sleep well heal well. and thats a very important factor that people have to understand especially in hospital settings uh or even at home if youre not feeling well sleep is actually a healing mechanism. and you need to allow your body to have a little extra if it needs it. so you have to be somewhat careful but usually your amount of sleep is reasonably set unless youre sleep deprived alright so youre going to bed at the wrong time and getting up at the wrong time and not getting enough good quality sleep or theres a medical condition on board that may make you need more sleep. usually when you hit the age of about 18 19 years old your amount of sleep is pretty set even though many people think that as they get older they need less sleep. in truth thats not the case. what we if you looked at the total minutes of sleep that somebody gets over the course of a day they take naps which they dont count towards their sleep or they may even take unscheduled naps where they are watching tv during the day because they are not working and theyve retired and all of a sudden they are out cold.,[],wmd
my kids don't sleep through the night so now i have dark circles around my eyes. what can i do to minimize them?,dark circles are a problem for everybody and sleep is a critical factor that's a really good point. however there are other things that people also do to make dark circles and discoloration around the eyes. i have noticed that people who have allergies who tend to rub their eyes a lot will also have dark circles. so you have to be aware of how much you are touching your eye. otherwise it's really a matter of managing your stress getting enough sleep and drinking enough water because dehydration will also cause that change there. there's two different components that can cause discoloration around the eye. one is pigment. that's what gives your skin color. the other is blood supply. so when you have a change in either or both of those two you see that change around the eye. the skin around the eye is very thin so you notice it there before you see it on other parts of the face or body and that's just a very sensitive area. the only thing you can really do is get a good concealer. hope your kids grow up fast and learn to sleep through the night or maybe close the door tighter. as long as your kids are safe and you know they are okay i think that a little bit of discussion with your children about their sleep patterns if they are old enough might also help but you really have to get enough sleep. there is just no other way around it.,"['eyes', 'skin']",wmd
i am facing premature ejaculation. how do i overcome it?,i completely emphasize with you. the problem of premature ejaculation is quite common and is distressing to a young man but is seldom discussed. see most of the time the problem is secondary to the anxiety attached to your expectations in the bed. it has been wrongly projected by unscientific magazine articles and porn that a man can last for 30 minutes or more. honestly most of the male ejaculate before 5 minutes. when you are anxious about not lasting long in bed you actually do not enjoy the act of intercourse and keep on thinking about prolonging the act without enjoying it. the preoccupation and anxiety about not lasting enough in fact cause hyperarousal and lead to premature ejaculation. moreover when the male start to thrust himself into the partner the moment he undress leads to early termination of coital act (the sexual union that takes place between male and female during insertion of penis into the vagina). there are also lots of young man who are suffering from premature ejaculation without any associated anxiety or apprehension. such men as well as you may benefit by taking oral medication like tablet dapoxetine or paroxetine before sexual act. but in your case i would like to suggest relaxation techniques like breathing exercises and progressive muscular relaxation. regarding your problem pertaining to non-retractable foreskin my opinion is that you must consult a surgeon. it is always better to remove foreskin if it is causing inflammation or itchiness. non-retractable foreskin is often associated with problems of genital hygiene that may subsequently lead to chronic infections. so make an appointment with a general surgeon. for further queries consult a sexologist online  ,['premature ejaculation'],ic

what is mcv?,mcv stands for mean corpuscular volume. its the average volume of the bodys red blood cells measured in femtoliters (one-quadrillionth of a liter). cell-counting machines calculate mcv from a blood sample. a normal value may vary between laboratories but is usually between 80 and 96 femtoliters (fl). an mcv above 100 fl is called macrocytosis. when anemia (low red blood cell count) is also present its called a macrocytic anemia. causes of macrocytic anemia include deficiency of b12 or folic acid medication side effects alcohol abuse and certain blood cancers. macrocytic anemia can also occur in healthy people who are rebuilding their blood supply (after surgery for example). an mcv below 80 fl is called microcytosis (or microcytic anemia if the red blood cell count is also low). microcytic anemia can be due to iron deficiency blood loss (in women most often from menstruation) chronic illness or a condition causing abnormal hemoglobin like sickle cell disease or thalassemia. its not unusual to have an mcv thats slightly abnormal without any serious condition identified as a cause. often in these cases the mcv becomes normal again on its own when its next tested.,[],wmd

what is benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) or an enlarged prostate?,as a man ages his prostate can grow larger. when a man reaches the age of 40 his prostate gland might have increased from the size of a walnut to that of an apricot. by the time he reaches the age of 60 it might be the size of a lemon. because it surrounds part of the urethra the enlarged prostate can squeeze the urethra. this causes problems in the passing of urine. typically these problems passing urine don't occur in men until they are age 50 or older. they can though occur earlier. an enlarged prostate is also called benign (noncancerous) prostatic hyperplasia. it is common and cannot be prevented. age and a family history of bph are risk factors. eight out of every 10 men eventually develop an enlarged prostate. about 90% of men over the age of 85 will have bph. about 30% of men will find their symptoms bothersome.,['benign prostatic hyperplasia'],wmd

i am 45 had tubal ligation 15 years ago and am 2 months late could i be pregnant? . my mother did not go in to menopause until her 60s. i have been under a lot of stress for the past two years. stopped taking all medication about 6 months ago (hbp antidepressant antipsychotic and one for headaches). my periods are irregular only in that they are heavy and painful and a few days off. (not weeks or months). i am scheduled for novasure procedure next week. if i am pregnant it would most likely be ectopic right?,"tubal ligation is a sterilization procedure that renders you unable to get pregnant. in tubal ligation the fallopian tubes are cut or blocked which makes it impossible for a sperm to reach an egg or for an egg to reach the uterus. since you had a tubal ligation procedure it's not likely you're pregnant. that said you should call your health care provider's office before the novasure procedure to let them know your period is late. they will be able to advise you regarding what steps to take (such as whether or not they want you to take a pregnancy test). on a broader note i wanted to say i hope you did not discontinue your medications without the supervision of a health care provider. conditions like high blood pressure often don't clear up on their own. if you still have blood pressure or depression issues you would be well-advised to obtain medical treatment to ensure your health and well-being. best of luck to you! i had my tubal ligation almost 16 years ago. i am currently 25 weeks pregnant. believe me i was stunned! but the doctors said that it can happen and i am evidence of that. our daughter destiny grace will be joining us around august 27th and although there are some health concerns considering that i'm a 3 time cancer survivor and about to turn 40 we are expecting a healthy baby girl. it was not an tubal pregnancy she made it directly into the womb and has been there from the start! i have a friend and she had her tube tied for 17yrs. she got pregnant and couldn't belive it. neither could i her tube came untied. so yes you could be pregnant. you could be going through mood swing and hot flases and still be pregnant. no one do not know your body who are they to judge only god and mother nature know best. good luck! it is possible to get pregnant after a tubal ligation. especially if you had the tl during a c-section. the fail rate for a tubal ligation is around 1 percent but goes up after ten years or if you had the tl during a c-section. sometimes the tubes reattach themselves or a fistula forms. although tubal pregnancy rates are higher if you had a tl than if you didn't have the ligation it is not ""more likely"" that you will have a tubal pregnancy than a successful one. if you are pregnant it would not ""most likely be ectopic. "" it's simply more likely than if you had not had a tubal ligation but the odds are still in your favor. i believe the chances of a woman without a tubal ligation has a 1 in 400 chance of an ectopic pregnancy but now you might have a 1 in 100 chance. so the odds are still quite in your favor but technically you're ""4 times more likely than you were before"" the tubal ligation. make sense? if you had clips put on your fallopian tubes they can fall off. and ties can break. but it's rare. my guess is you are either entering menopause which is not a linear process for most of us. we stop our periods they come again and get off and on until finally they don't return. or your body is reacting to the medication changes. our bodies are more sensitive than we realize. when we moved and i was about 40 my body stopped having periods for nearly 7 months. then they suddenly resumed and never missed one since. now i'm 52 and i'm still having my periods regularly. if i were you i'd let myself wonder about pregnancy. but i'd think it's probably the third most likely possibility. (and an ectopic pregnancy will be looked at quickly. ) still missing that many months of your period if you are not having mood swings or hot flashes would get me to call my doctor just to check things out. good luck!","['period', 'stress', 'tubal ligation', 'irregularity', 'antidepressant']",wmd

who is at risk for gallstones?,the risk factors for developing cholesterol gallstones include: gender. gallstones form more commonly in women than men. age. gallstone prevalence increases with age. obesity. obese people are more likely to form gallstones than thin individuals. pregnancy. women who have been pregnant are more likely to form gallstones than women who have not been pregnant. pregnancy increases the risk for cholesterol gallstones because during pregnancy bile contains more cholesterol and the gallbladder does not contract normally. birth control pills and hormone therapy the increased levels of hormones caused by either treatment mimics pregnancy. rapid weight loss. rapid weight loss by whatever means very low calorie diets or obesity surgery causes cholesterol gallstones in up to 50% of individuals. many of the gallstones will disappear after the weight is lost but many do not. moreover until they are gone they may cause problems. crohn's disease. individuals with crohn's disease of the terminal ileum are more likely to develop gallstones. gallstones form because patients with crohn's disease lack enough bile acids to solubilize the cholesterol in bile. normally bile acids that enter the small intestine from the liver and gallbladder are absorbed back into the body in the terminal ileum and are secreted again by the liver into bile. in other words the bile acids recycle. in crohn's disease the terminal ileum is diseased. bile acids are not absorbed normally the body becomes depleted of bile acids and less bile acids are secreted in bile. there are not enough bile acids to keep cholesterol dissolved in bile and gallstones form. increased blood triglycerides. gallstones occur more frequently in people with elevated blood triglyceride levels. risk for pigment gallstones black pigment gallstones form whenever there is an increased load of bilirubin that reaches the liver. this occurs whenever there is increased destruction of red blood cells as there is in sickle cell disease and thalassemia. black pigment gallstones also are more common among patients with cirrhosis of the liver. brown pigment gallstones form when there is stasis of bile (decreased flow) for example when there are narrow obstructed bile ducts.,['gallstone'],wmd

how should a male condom be used?,take caution when opening the wrapper to avoid tearing the condom with your teeth fingernails or rings. gently pinch the air out of the tip of the condom before putting it on. the condom is rolled over the erect penis before sexual activity begins. if the condom does not have a built-in nipple leave about 1/2-inch of the condom free at the tip of the penis so that semen has a place to collect. a new condom must be used each time you have sex. the condom must be in place before the penis gets near the vagina. if you use lubricants with a condom be sure to only use water-based lubricants such as k-y jelly. oil-based lubricants such as vaseline massage oils and body lotions can cause condoms to leak or break. certain vaginal medications used to treat yeast infections can also weaken condoms. initially it was felt that condoms lubricated with spermicidal agents offered more protection against stds. newer studies show that frequent use of condoms containing spermicides offers no additional protection and it may actually increase the risk of hiv and other stds by irritating the vagina and penis. spermicidal products do however remain useful in pregnancy prevention.,['condom'],wmd

pharmacogenetics testing. does it work? what negative aspects should a person consider? how prevalent is it's use? will insurance companies base what they will authorize based on these results?,insurance companies may cover certain types of genetic testing but there seems to be no consistency in how or which tests are covered. the only way to know is to contact your health plan directly to find out. to answer your question; yes it does work but they are limited by the amount genes that have been sequenced and workd on so far. negative aspects are yet to be fully understood but as far as health goes the advantages are pretty fantastic. the ramifications of having a health provider screen you based on your genetic disposition is a scary thought for a lot of folks. it's use is increasing especially in the light of president obama's recent speech including it; the president called pharmcogenetics precision medicine ( video link) and called for a huge amount of money to be dedicated towards development and research in this field. it's use is surely going to expand. it makes sense saves time money and whole lot of effort. you can call your insurance company and find out if it's something they will cover but it's relatively new. this subject is something that i personally find fascinating and i found a lot of good information about pharmaco genetic testing. it's only going to be growing and i kinda get excited thinking about how many people this new technology is going to help. i myself have struggled to find the right meds for me but with genetic screening and testing i don't have to worry about that as much. bottom line-it's something you should research some more but it could be very worth it. hope that helped. jim,['insurance'],wmd

should low testosterone be treated even if there are no symptoms? . what is the risk of a borderline low level? what if is not treated?,that's a very interesting question. i'm glad you asked. in the medical community we often tend not to treat a condition that's asymptomatic (doesn't have symptoms). as long as you're sure your low testosterone levels aren't related to another condition such as obesity or diabetes i think the choice of whether or not to treat it is up to you. it's a discussion you should have with your health care provider. he or she can contribute their expert medical knowledge and you can take into account your personal values and feelings. between the two of you you can arrive at a decision that's right for you. remember too you can always change your mind. if you choose not to treat your low testosterone now but experience symptoms in the future you can always opt for testosterone replacement therapy. likewise if you decide to treat your low testosterone now you can always choose to discontinue treatment later. take care!,['testosterone'],wmd

my husband currently has shingles how can i prevent myself and 2 year old from getting it?,my husband had shingles and both my daughters got chicken pox. the incubation period is 14 to 21 days from the time they first are exposed. he had them on his chest and they did not come in contact with that part of him but they got them anyway. i think exposure is more than touching the scabs evidently. but the old saying that if you get them once you won't get them again is only true with chicken pox. if a person is susceptible and exposed and their resistance is low they will get shingles if exposed to them or if their body won't fight it off. some people opt for a shot that i'm not sure of the name of it but if a person gets it within a certain amount of time after the recover from the shingles they are less likely to get them again. but they say it is quite expensive. so just being in the same house and touching things the person with shingles has touched will cause a child to contact the chicken pox as it is of the same virus.,['shingles'],wmd

(two opinions) my case was such that i had the option of choosing the type of treatment after much research. not everyone i understand is suitable for some treatments due to various factors. meanwhile i went on hormone therapy. it supposedly eliminates the food this cancer grows on (testortrone) shrinks the prostate and is believed to make the cancer cell more vulnerable to future radiation treatment if that is the choice. i chose radiated seed implant - there are other courses of treatment available - the one that is best for your brother if he has cancer are between his doctors and himself mainly not what we others chose. if your brother would like to discuss the various options there are many contributors tauting their success and methods of treatment and all of us are more than willing to discuss any questions / concerns or things we experienced. don't panic. there is a lot of data available. research it on the internet and through the amer. cancer site. they too are able willing and responsive to any questions. all we survivors can impart is what we experienced. do hope this is helping you but if you do get tested and things don't look bad and its just enlarged do have a read up about tuna if you have this done it shrinks it down i do know of somebody who had this done perked up his sex life so his wife is now very happy about that but do hope this helps you. good luck,"['lump', 'prostate', 'prostate cancer']",wmd

what can i do to treat epilepsy at home?,controlling seizures caused by epilepsy requires a daily commitment to following your treatment plan. if you are using antiepileptic medicine you must take your medicine exactly as prescribed. not following the treatment plan is one of the main reasons why medicines fail to control seizures. antiepileptic medicines will work only if the right medicine level is maintained in your body. your doctor will set up a schedule of medicine dosages that keeps the proper medicine levels in your body. missing one or more doses can throw the whole system off. see information on: epilepsy: taking your medicines properly. the same rule about following your treatment plan applies if you or your child is on a special ketogenic diet. the ketogenic diet can be hard to follow but it must be followed exactly. as you follow your treatment plan also try to identify and avoid things that may make you more likely to have a seizure such as: not getting enough sleep. using drugs or alcohol. being emotionally stressed. skipping meals. if you continue to have seizures despite treatment keep a record of any seizures you have. note the date time of day and any details about the seizure that you can remember. your doctor can use information about your seizures to plan or adjust your medicine or other treatment. if you have not been diagnosed with epilepsy a record of your seizures can help your doctor figure out whether you might have epilepsy and what kinds of seizures you are having. if your child or someone else in your family has epilepsy learn what to do when someone has a seizure. if you have epilepsy (or your child has epilepsy): be sure that any doctor treating you for any condition knows that you have epilepsy and knows what medicines you are taking if any. wear a medical identification bracelet (such as medicalert). in the event of a seizure or accident that leaves you unconscious or unable to speak for yourself a medical id bracelet will let those who are treating you know that you have epilepsy. it will also list any medicines you are taking to control your seizures so that you are not given any medicines that will react badly with those already in your body. if you have a child with epilepsy there are other tips for parents that may be helpful. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,['epilepsy'],wmd

while on birth control i took an antibiotic and was late taking birth control pills. could i be pregnant if i had sex?,the risk of pregnancy in using routine antibiotics and birth control pills (bcps) is very low. in fact antifungals (e. g. ketoconazole) or macrolide antibiotics (e. g. erythromycin azythromycin biaxin) actually increased blood levels of estradiolnot decrease them. being late taking some bcps can also increase [the] risk of pregnancy but the risk is not large unless you entirely miss for two to three days. unprotected sex on active pills does not increase risk unless you had just completely missed several days of active pills. . i would urge you to do a reliable pregnancy test. for the most accurate answer you can do one test on the first day of your next pack. .,"['sexual intercourse', 'pregnancy', 'birth control', 'antibiotic', 'birth control pill']",wmd

what is the best way to stop hormone replacement therapy?,"once you and your clinician have decided that it's time to stop what's the best approach? the simple answer is that we don't know. formal studies to evaluate this question have failed to show that either going cold turkey or tapering off is better. so the choice is really yours. the important thing is to know that women in general have about a 50/50 chance of experiencing hot flashes again (although maybe not as severe as initially) after stopping. some studies suggest that symptoms peak within 3 months after stopping hormones. after you stop take some time to evaluate how you feel before beginning any new medication so you don't get the two effects confused. there are a couple of other things to keep an eye on once you've stopped ht. if you develop vaginal dryness or recurrent urinary tract infections ask your clinician about vaginal estrogens. nonhormonal lubricants and moisturizers can also help with dryness. and you might want to ask about a bone density test. we know that women who stop ht often lose bone. depending on your bone density score and risk profile you might be a candidate for an osteoporosis drug (bone-sparing). at any rate discuss calcium and vitamin d supplements weight-bearing exercise and fall prevention with your clinician. another good idea is to have your cholesterol rechecked in about 3 months after stopping ht because hormones can affect ""lipid levels"" (both good and bad). and if you're taking a thyroid medication for an underactive thyroid your dose might need to be adjusted. thanks for your reply!",['hormone replacement therapy'],wmd

i am losing eyelashes when i wear waterproof mascara. what can i use to clean my face that won't damage my eyelashes?,it's important to use an eye makeup remover that's specific for waterproof mascara. i am not a big fan of waterproof mascara for that very reason. i think it does coat the eyelashes a little too heavily and can be difficult to remove and sometimes the eyelashes can come out with it. fortunately the eyelash cycle is pretty quick so your hair will grow back very quickly over time really within a matter of a few weeks. but it's uncomfortable if you are using it over a long period of time to keep losing lashes like that. so i would try recommending a water-based mascara except for very special occasions when you really need something longer lasting. then if you have the waterproof mascara look for something that's very specific and take your time. let it sit on your lashes for a little bit longer and then rinse with lukewarm water and then repeat the process without rubbing because it's the rubbing that can physically remove the lashes.,['injury'],wmd

how do i choose an over-the-counter heartburn medication?,this is a great question. when patients come in or consumers and ask me about heartburn as a pharmacist i have to ask them a few questions to find out what kind of heartburn are they having. for instance if they are having heartburn at night they really need to see a physician. i need to find out how frequently they are having their heartburn. if they are having it everyday or is it only one or two times a week? then i need to ask them some questions about their diet because what they may not understand is that diet caffeine acidic foods even smoking could lead to heartburn. then i will look at them and say okay are they taking any other medications? my elderly patients hopefully they have their medication list with them. i will be able to take a look and see what's appropriate for them. there are a variety of different products that are available. if it's just something for quick relief then you could use like an antacid like a maalox or a tums something along those lines. if it's something that maybe needs a little bit more consistency then we can go more towards a pepcid type of product which works a little differently by cutting down on the amount of acid in the stomach. if they complain that they have had it more frequently during the day for a number of days then the choice might be something like prilosec otc which they are going to take for about 14 days. if they come back to the pharmacy after that and the 14 days and it hasn't worked then i am going refer them back to their physician or their healthcare provider for further evaluation.,"['heartburn', 'over the counter', 'drug']",wmd

i have chronic allergies which become worse in winter. please suggest ayurvedic medicine.,the allergic symptoms usually aggravate during winter season. it continues from november till february based on the climate in your place. you have not mentioned about the allergic site (nose or lung or skin). if it is nose or lung the dryness due to winter can trigger the allergic response in nose. in this situation you need to maintain moisture by just applying a drop of coconut oil in each nostril before going to bed. on the other hand you can apply a drop of anu thailam (an ayurvedic nasal drops for allergy) in each nostril before going to bed. during evenings and nights when it is too cold you need to protect your ears (by keeping cotton plug) nose (by applying oil drops) head (by covering head with a woolen cap) and hands and feet (by wearing gloves and socks). the external cold stimulus triggers the allergic response. so prevent yourself from the cold stimulus to avoid allergy. if you have allergic asthma then it is better to practice pranayama and yoga. breathing exercises will help you. if you have allergic skin disorder then you can use vaseline or vegetable oils to gently apply on the skin. this helps in overcoming the dryness due to the cold climate. the skin manifestation should also be examined by a physician to decide the proper medication. revert back to an ayurveda specialist online for further follow up  ,['allergy'],ic

"should i be worried if i have symptoms of a tia occuring 5-10 times a month? . i have lupus. for the last 2 years i have been experiencing numbness and tingling on 1/2 of my face 5-10 times per month. i literally can feel a perfect line of numb vs. normal down my nose and lips on the left side. they have done mri's that have come out normal. now i am occasionally feeling numbness/tingling down my arm and leg also on the left side. i don't know if is should be worried or just chalk it up as ""yet another lupus symptom"".",hi i found this piece of info if this is you? during a tia one of the small blood vessels that supply your brain with oxygen-rich blood becomes blocked. atherosclerosis is a common cause of narrowed arteries. it occurs when fatty deposits known as plaques develop on the inner lining of your blood vessels. this can cause your blood vessels to become thickened hard and less elastic making it more difficult for blood to flow through them. ok if this is you then simple cayenne pepper may help clear this plaque away for you there are many ways to take cayenne you can try capsules the ok but when the capsule opens inside you it can give you the cramps or like me you can mix cayenne with tomato paste and thin with olive oil to start with to a heat that suits you next time you mix you can add a bit more and so on take 3 small spoonful's each morning wash each down with water now if you want because it very good for your blood do a jar of very fine chopped garlic and keep this in olive oil just add a spoonful on top of the cayenne before you take it. all very good for you and give it a couple of weeks to start working at full strength. good luck,"['lupus', 'numbness', 'nose', 'lip', 'arm']",wmd
what is medicare's definition of marriage and where will i find it? . gay marriage is legal in california and since last july with the rescindment of defense of marriage act by the supreme court is also legal by federal standards. medicare tells me that it doesn't recognize gay marriage and that medicare's definition of marriage is between a man and a woman. is that true and where can i find the statute that includes that definition? it is causing serious problems with the coordination of benefits with the insurance carried by the employer of my spouse.,it was only last summer that the law changed so that medicare can recognize eligibility for same-sex spouses. it's entirely possible that it's going to take some time for the understanding of this change to make its way through the ranks. you can check this site on medicare. gov for more information on the topic:  you might also request assistance from your spouse's human resources department. and you can ask for assistance from your state health insurance assistance program. to find one near you check here:  good luck.,['insurance'],wmd

will calcium supplement help to heal broken bones faster? what will speed the healing? . 2 broken bones in the right hand of my sixteen year old son. the break is vertical so less likely to shift.,"i can see why it might sound logical that calcium supplementation could help broken bones heal faster. after all bones are made of calcium right? so feeding them calcium should speed up healing. unfortunately that's not how it works. unless you have a pre-existing calcium deficiency (not likely in an otherwise healthy 16-year-old boy) taking calcium will not help your bones heal. the process of bone healing is called ""remodeling. "" your body removes dead bone cells and builds new ones in their place. this process occurs on a pretty predictable schedule. for common fractures like the one you describe the remodeling process normally takes 6 to 8 weeks. unfortunately your son will just have to wait this out. what will help the bones heal on schedule is not engaging in activities that put stress on the areas of the fracture. resting the hand (to keep the fractures stable) will allow the body to do its remodeling job and get the bones back to normal. wishing you well!","['calcium', 'supplement', 'healing', 'broken bone', 'hand']",wmd

how is osteoarthritis diagnosed?,there is no blood test for the diagnosis of osteoarthritis. blood tests are performed to exclude diseases that can cause secondary osteoarthritis as well as to exclude other arthritis conditions that can mimic osteoarthritis. x-rays of the affected joints can suggest osteoarthritis. the common x-ray findings of osteoarthritis include loss of joint cartilage narrowing of the joint space between adjacent bones and bone spur formation. simple x-ray testing can be very helpful to exclude other causes of pain in a particular joint as well as assist in decision making as to when surgical intervention should be considered. arthrocentesis is often performed in the doctor's office. during arthrocentesis a sterile needle is used to remove joint fluid for analysis. joint fluid analysis is useful in excluding gout infection and other causes of arthritis. removal of joint fluid and injection of corticosteroids into the joints during arthrocentesis can help relieve pain swelling and inflammation. arthroscopy is a surgical technique whereby a doctor inserts a viewing tube into the joint space. abnormalities of and damage to the cartilage and ligaments can be detected and sometimes repaired through the arthroscope. if successful patients can recover from the arthroscopic surgery much more quickly than from open joint surgery. finally a careful analysis of the location duration and character of the joint symptoms and the appearance of the joints helps the doctor in diagnosing osteoarthritis. bony enlargement of the joints from spur formations is characteristic of osteoarthritis. therefore the presence of heberden's nodes bouchard's nodes and bunions of the feet can indicate to the doctor a diagnosis of osteoarthritis.,['osteoarthritis'],wmd

what is the treatment for ringworm?,antifungal medications are used to cure ringworm. ringworm can be treated topically (with external applications) or systemically (for example with oral medications): topical treatment: when fungus affects the skin of the body or the groin many antifungal creams can clear the condition in around two weeks. examples of such preparations include those that contain clotrimazole (cruex cream desenex cream lotrimin cream lotion and solution) miconazole (monistat-derm cream) ketoconazole (nizoral cream) econazole (spectazole) naftifine (naftin) and terbinafine (lamisil cream and solution). these treatments are effective for many cases of foot fungus as well. many of these antifungal creams are available as over-the-counter preparations. it is usually necessary to use topical medications for at least two weeks. systemic treatment: some fungal infections do not respond well to external applications. examples include scalp fungus and fungus of the nails. to penetrate these areas and in cases of particularly severe or extensive disease oral medications can be used. for a long time the only effective antifungal tablet was griseofulvin (fulvicin grifulvin and gris-peg). now other agents are available that are both safer and more effective. these include terbinafine itraconazole (sporanox) and fluconazole (diflucan). oral medications are usually given for a three-month course.,['ringworm'],wmd
have cystocope and urodynamic test tomorrow what should i expect as far as pain? am pretty scared! . have pretty sever bph and am a male age 53 what can i expect?,well i'm not going to sugarcoat it. a cystoscopy isn't the most pleasant experience you'll ever have. on the other hand it's not as painful as say a big incision in your abdomen. based on feedback from male friends who have had a cystoscopy i can tell you they describe the discomfort of the procedure as: pinching and pressure. they say it's not so bad they felt they would have preferred sedation especially since the procedure only takes a few minutes. according to my friends the discomfort lasts about an hour or so but there's no pain or burning on urination afterwards. for the urodynamic test you probably will have a urinary (foley) catheter placed and then your bladder will be filled with fluid. in my experience as a nurse many men have told me the sensation of having a catheter placed was quite uncomfortable. those who could relax and focus their attention elsewhere seemed to tolerate the procedure better. and that is my advice to you. as much as possible focus your attention on your breathing. take long slow deep breaths. focus on making your navel (belly button) rise and fall. it may sound wackadoodle but this relaxation technique really does work. also try to hold a mental image in your mind of you walking out of the clinic getting into your car and driving home. this will help remind you the discomfort is only temporary and soon will be over with. i know you'll breeze through these procedures just fine. wishing you well!,"['urodynamic test', 'pain', 'fear', 'benign prostatic hyperplasia']",wmd

what happens to someone when they get inguinal hernia?,inguinal hernias typically flatten or disappear when they are pushed gently back into place or when you lie down. over time hernias tend to increase in size as the abdominal muscle wall becomes weaker and more tissue bulges through. if you can't push your hernia back into your belly it is incarcerated. a hernia gets incarcerated when tissue moves into the sac of the hernia and fills it up. this is not necessarily an emergency. but if a loop of the intestine is trapped very tightly in the hernia the blood supply to that part of the intestine can be cut off ( strangulated ) causing tissue to die. in a man if tissue is trapped the testicle and its blood vessels can also be damaged. a strangulated hernia is a medical emergency that requires immediate surgery. in adults a hernia that can be pushed back into the abdomen can be surgically repaired at a convenient time. this is because incarceration is rare in adults. a hernia that cannot be pushed back can be repaired when surgery is convenient unless you have increased pain redness of the overlying skin fever nausea and vomiting or abdominal bloating. if any of these symptoms occur the hernia may need to be fixed sooner. inguinal hernias can come back after surgical repair. but in women it is rare for inguinal hernias to recur. fertility is usually not affected by an inguinal hernia or hernia surgery. but in males there is a chance that surgery or an incarcerated hernia can cause injury to the vas deferens the tube that carries sperm from the testicles to the urethra. it is not yet known how often or to what degree this affects a man's ability to father a child. in rare cases surgery or an incarcerated hernia may injure the blood vessels that supply one or both testicles with blood which may cause the affected testicle to shrink. hernias in children infants or children with an inguinal hernia need to have surgery as soon as possible because of the increased risk that a part of the intestine will become trapped and blood supply will be cut off leading to tissue death. incarceration when intestinal or abdominal tissue fills up the sac of a hernia occurs in about 2 or 3 out of 10 infants younger than 6 months who have hernias. most incarcerated hernias occur before the infant is 1 year old. 1 female infants face a higher risk of incarceration. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,['hernia'],wmd

can a stroke just affect the legs and nothing elsse?,"that's a good question. a stroke is what we call the death of small portions of brain tissue due to an interruption of oxygen delivery. common causes of stroke include a blood clot (which prevents the flow of oxygen-rich blood to an area of the brain) or a hemorrhage (basically a burst blood vessel in the brain). usually the symptoms of stroke such as weakness only affect one side of the body not both. so if your question is ""can stroke cause weakness in both legs and nothing else "" then the answer is ""probably not"" because a stroke doesn't usually affect both sides of the body at the same time. if your question is ""can stroke cause weakness is one leg and no other body parts on that side "" the answer again is ""probably not. "" usually a stroke causes weakness to the entire side of the body from the face to the toes. everyone should know the symptoms of stroke because stroke is an emergency that requires prompt treatment. if you ever suspect someone is having a stroke do these three things: ask them to give you a big big grin and hold it. does one side of the mouth droop? if so this is a sign of stroke. ask them to extend both arms out at shoulder height and hold them. is the person able to raise both arms equally? if not this can be a sign of stroke. ask them to answer a simple question such as ""what do you see out the window? "" or ""what did you eat for lunch? "" if the person can't give you a coherent answer (if their words don't go together correctly) this can be a sign of stroke. if the person you're testing for stroke does not pass two of the above tests call 911 immediately. when it comes to stroke better safe than sorry! hope this helps. yes! woke up one morning and fell for leg gave out upon standing. waited a few hours before going to er for left leg and foot was very heavy and numb. cat scan showed i had stroke. found out after many more tests that right corotid artery was totally blocked. left leg and foot still numb and heavy.","['stroke', 'leg']",wmd

do dna skin repair products really work?,up until fairly recently the only way to reverse sun damage was to have laser treatments chemical peels or use retinols and prescription tretinoin creams. a revolutionary innovation in the cosmeceutical industry is changing that. now all you may need to do is go to your drugstore or department store and look for products that contain dna repair ingredients. these ingredients now come in every product imaginable — creams lotions serums sunscreens. and heres the wonderful thing: they really do work. dna skin repair ingredients are usually based on enzymes derived from a variety of sources including plankton and plants. most of the major skin care companies are already selling dna repair products and are closely following the new research. all these products seem to improve the skin so it is not necessary to buy the most expensive one. these enzymes work by restoring dna that has been damaged by free radicals most often caused by sun exposure pollution and other environmental factors. dna damage is what causes sagging wrinkles and rough-textured skin. in other words its what makes you look old. dna repair products dont seem to fade brown spots though and though they soften fine lines they wont have the dramatic effect of botox or hyaluronic acid fillers that plump deep creases. still people really notice a difference after a few weeks of using these products and they are usually happy with the results. one of the advantages of most dna repair products is that unlike tretinoin and retinols (which should only be used at night) they do not interact with sunlight and can be used during the day. in fact a few sunscreens already include dna repair ingredients. although the research is still coming in this may be the wave of the future in sun protection.,[],wmd

(this used to happen to me all the time with a previous partner but since i've become older i don't have the problem. but my current partner is better at oral hygiene) also you can talk to your doctor about things that you can do to prevent this. obviously no longer kissing is going to be a solution but i doubt that will happen. if it becomes a serious issue and it doesnt go away within 3 days go to a doctor and tell them the possible origin! as some one else pointed out there are also sti's that can cause oral infections ones that are transferred from genitals to/from your mouth/throat. if you're getting seriously sick you need to consider that possibility that they need to be checked out. he may be a carrier or host. but that needs to be discussed with a doctor as well.,"['sore throat', 'smoking', 'healthy eating']",wmd

what causes depression in women specifically related to pregnancy and childbirth?,"there may be a number of reasons why a woman gets depressed. hormone changes or a stressful life event such as a death in the family can cause chemical changes in the brain that lead to depression. depression is also an illness that runs in some families. other times it's not clear what causes depression. during pregnancy during pregnancy these factors may increase a woman's chance of depression: history of depression or substance abuse family history of mental illness little support from family and friends anxiety about the fetus problems with previous pregnancy or birth marital or financial problems young age (of mother) after pregnancy depression after pregnancy is called postpartum depression or peripartum depression. after pregnancy hormonal changes in a woman's body may trigger symptoms of depression. during pregnancy the amount of two female hormones estrogen and progesterone in a woman's body increases greatly. in the first 24 hours after childbirth the amount of these hormones rapidly drops back down to their normal non-pregnant levels. researchers think the fast change in hormone levels may lead to depression just as smaller changes in hormones can affect a woman's moods before she gets her menstrual period. occasionally levels of thyroid hormones may also drop after giving birth. the thyroid is a small gland in the neck that helps to regulate your metabolism (how your body uses and stores energy from food). low thyroid levels can cause symptoms of depression including depressed mood decreased interest in things irritability fatigue difficulty concentrating sleep problems and weight gain. a simple blood test can tell if this condition is causing a woman's depression. if so thyroid medicine can be prescribed by a doctor. other factors that may contribute to postpartum depression include: feeling tired after delivery broken sleep patterns and not enough rest often keeps a new mother from regaining her full strength for weeks. feeling overwhelmed with a new or another baby to take care of and doubting your ability to be a good mother. feeling stress from changes in work and home routines. sometimes women think they have to be ""super mom"" or perfect which is not realistic and can add stress. having feelings of loss  loss of identity of who you are or were before having the baby loss of control loss of your pre-pregnancy figure and feeling less attractive. having less free time and less control over time. having to stay home indoors for longer periods of time and having less time to spend with your partner and loved ones.","['depression', 'pregnancy']",wmd

how can insulin dosage effect cortisol levels. 88 yo diabetic checked for possible heart attack ruled out. was told insulin dosage may be too high causing cortisol reaction that caused his symptoms,"cortisol plays an important role in human nutrition. it regulates energy by selecting the right type and amount of substrate (carbohydrate fat or protein) the body needs to meet the physiological demands placed on it. when chronically elevated cortisol can have deleterious effect on weight immune function and chronic disease risk. cortisol along with epinephrine is best known for its involvement in what the medical profession say in the ""fight-or-flight response and temporary increase in energy production at the expense of processes that are not required for immediate survival. let me see if i can clarify this: an individual or person is faced with a stressor a complex hormonal cascade ensues and the adrenals secrete cortisol then cortisol prepares the body for a fight-or-flight response by flooding it with glucose supplying an immediate energy source to large muscles. cortisol inhibits insulin production in an attempt to prevent glucose from being stored favoring its immediate use. cortisol narrows the arteries while the epinephrine increases heart rate both of which force blood to pump harder and faster. then this may cause the person to think he may be having a heart attack. the individual addresses and resolves the situation. hormone levels return to normal. in short the theory is that with our ever-stressed fast paced lifestyle our bodies are pumping out cortisol almost constantly which can cause problems on our health. our whole bodies are mediated by hormones and the immune system identifies cortisol as just one of many players. but if we isolate its role we can put into context the many complex mechanisms that lead to specific physiological damage. under stressful conditions cortisol provides the body with glucose by tapping into protein stores via gluconeogenesis in the liver. this energy can help an indiviual fight or flee a stressor. however elevated cortisol over the long term consistently produces glucose leading to increased blood sugar levels. ask your doctor for any information on diabetes and tell him what specifically you are looking for i am sure that they have the information. if you still are having problems ask your doctor to send you to a diabetic counselor or management counselor to help you to understand diabetes. i do hope you get to feeling better and please keep us informed how you are doing. thank you.","['insulin', 'cortisol', 'diabetes', 'heart attack', 'reaction']",wmd

how long should you wear compression stockings after hip replacement surgery,that's a great question for your doctor. i'd say to wear them until your doctor tells you it's ok to stop. compression stockings are worn after procedures like hip replacement to help reduce the chance of a blood clot ( deep vein thrombosis or dvt ). dvts may not occur until a couple of weeks post-surgery so you should wear the hose at least that long. if you have any fluid buildup in your legs you also need to keep wearing the compression stockings. fluid buildup can be a sign of poor circulation which again can lead to the development of a dvt. so in a nutshell seek your surgeon's advice as to when you can stop wearing the stockings. and don't stop too soon! all the best to you!,['surgery'],wmd

i had a vaginal pimple was popped cleaned but now keeps bleeding as if it were an open wound that won't stop bleeding. i've had a vaginal pimple before but it healed up and left sort of a scar like thing. but it came back again it popped so i cleaned it and covered the area with a bandaid to stop the bleeding now it just stop bleeding at all. it's like an open wound that doesn not stop bleeding no matter how many times i clean and cover it.,i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. here's the thing. this could be some sort of blemish like a clogged pore but that pimple also could be the sign of a sexually transmitted disease. even if you've never had unprotected sex you should see a gynecologist while that pimple is active so that he or she can diagnose the problem. i'd suggest calling to make an appointment as soon as possible. meanwhile you should avoid having sex even with a condom. condoms may not fully protect your partner against certain stds such as genital herpes. best of luck to you!,"['scar', 'wound', 'vagina', 'healing']",wmd

what are the symptoms of an enlarged prostate?,as a man ages the prostate can grow larger. when a man reaches the age of 40 the prostate gland might have increased from the size of a walnut to that of an apricot. by the time he reaches the age of 60 it might be the size of a lemon. because it surrounds part of the urethra the enlarged prostate can squeeze the urethra. this causes problems in the passing of urine. typically these problems passing urine don't occur in men until they are age 50 or older. they can though occur earlier. an enlarged prostate is also called benign (noncancerous) prostatic hyperplasia or bph. it is common and cannot be prevented. age and a family history of bph are risk factors. eight out of every 10 men eventually develop an enlarged prostate. about 90% of men over the age of 85 will have bph. about 30% of men will find their symptoms bothersome. symptoms of an enlarged prostate may include: trouble starting to urinate or urinating freely. having to urinate frequently particularly at night. feeling that the bladder is not empty after urinating. feeling a sudden urge to urinate. having to stop and start repeatedly while urinating. having to strain to urinate. to maintain prostate health it is important for men who have early symptoms of bph to see their doctor. bph is a progressive disease. it can lead to serious although rare health problems such as kidney or bladder damage.,['benign prostatic hyperplasia'],wmd

can shingles be prevented with a vaccine?,there are several effective treatments for shingles. drugs that fight viruses (antivirals) such as acyclovir (zovirax) valacyclovir (valtrex) or famciclovir (famvir) can reduce the severity and duration of the rash if started early (within 72 hours of the appearance of the rash). in addition to antiviral medications pain medications may be needed for symptom control. both nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and narcotic pain-control medications may be used for pain management in shingles. the affected area should be kept clean. bathing is permitted and the area can be cleansed with soap and water. cool compresses and anti-itching lotions such as calamine lotion may also provide relief. an aluminum acetate solution (burow's or domeboro solution available at your pharmacy) can be used to help dry up the blisters and oozing. in may 2006 the u. s. food and drug administration (fda) approved the first vaccine for adult shingles. the vaccine developed by merck laboratories and known as zostavax is approved for use in adults ages 60 and over who have had chickenpox. the shingles vaccine contains a booster dose of the chickenpox vaccine usually given to children. tests over an initial four-year period showed that the vaccine significantly reduced the incidence of shingles in these older adults. the single-dose vaccine was shown to be more than 60% effective in reducing shingles symptoms and it reduced the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia (phn see above) by at least two-thirds. studies are ongoing to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine over a longer term. there are certain contraindications to receiving the shingles vaccine. people with weakened immune systems due to immune-suppressing medications cancer treatment hiv disease or organ transplants should not receive the shingles vaccine because it contains live weakened viral particles. there is not enough information available from researchers to decide at this point whether zostavax may be beneficial in people younger than 60 years of age. since the chickenpox vaccine is now recommended for children the incidence of chickenpox has been reduced. this is also expected to reduce the incidence of shingles in adults in the future as these vaccinated children age.,['shingles'],wmd
what are some of the harmful health effects of smoking pipes and cigars?,cancer. even if you don't inhale you can get a number of different cancers from smoking pipes and cigars. people who smoke cigars regularly are four to 10 times more likely than nonsmokers to die from cancers of the mouth larynx and esophagus. oral cancer can develop anywhere the smoke touches including the lips mouth throat and tongue. people who inhale also increase their risk for cancers of the lung pancreas and bladder. lung disease. cigar and pipe smoking double the risk for the airway damage that leads to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) a lung disease that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. smoking can also worsen existing asthma. heart disease. smoking cigars or pipes increases your likelihood of having heart disease or a stroke. cigars boost the risk of early death from coronary heart disease by 30%. teeth problems. smoking pipes or cigars wreaks havoc on your mouth contributing to gum disease stained teeth bad breath and tooth loss. one study showed that pipe and cigar smokers had an average of four missing teeth. erectile dysfunction. smokers are twice as likely to have erectile dysfunction as nonsmokers. cigars and pipes aren't just dangerous to the people who smoke them. they also give off secondhand smoke filled with toxic chemicals such as carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. because a cigar wrapper (which is made from a tobacco leaf) is less porous than a cigarette wrapper it doesn't burn as thoroughly as a cigarette wrapper. this increases the concentration of cancer-causing substances such as ammonia tar and carbon monoxide released into the air. despite their sweet aroma water pipes are also dangerous to your health. during a typical hookah smoking session you'll inhale 100 to 200 times the volume of smoke that you'd get from a cigarette. water pipes deliver at least as much nicotine and toxins as cigarettes and put users at similar risk for cancer and other smoking-related diseases. the same advice is true for pipe and cigar smokers as for cigarette smokers: quit. if you can't kick the habit on your own get help from your doctor another health professional or a smoking cessation service (1-800-quit-now). also make sure to get regular checkups  including mouth exams to look for signs of oral cancer  and talk to your doctor about getting screened for lung cancer.,['smoking'],wmd

what are some easy ways to serve apples?,fall is the time for apples. whether they are in a salad roasted and served with pork or in a dessert you cant go wrong. one of my favorite and simplest fall deserts is an apple crisp. i love the rustic version that has a bit of fresh thyme and a crumble topping that is as good for you as it is delicious. the great thing about this dessert is 1) its simple to make; 2) it has a balanced amount of butter and sugar so compared to many desserts it is a much healthier choice; and 3) you can serve this easily as a weeknight treat or for a dinner party on the run. start with your favorite apple. i recommend a crispy and tangy one like gala pink lady and honey crisp (avoid mealy apples such as red delicious). from there cut up the apples (i leave the skin on mine) into small chunks (nickel size). toss them in a bowl with fresh thyme (about 1 tablespoon per 4 whole apples) a bit of agave nectar or honey and a light sprinkle of flour. you can add either dried or fresh cranberries for more flavor and a great boost of antioxidants. for the topping combine rolled oats chopped almonds or pecans butter brown sugar and shredded coconut. bake in individual dishes or a large baking dish for about 20-30 minutes. serve warm with vanilla ice cream or fresh whipped cream. this is a great dessert for the holidays and can be made a few days ahead of time and reheated before serving. apples add another simple and healthy flavor boost to pork or chicken dishes. roast apples with a bit of rosemary sage or thyme. serve this hot savory topping over your meat. present the dish on a large white plate with a few fresh sprigs of rosemary and look how fancy you are now!,[],wmd

"i am hungry all the time no matter what or how much i eat. what could be causing this? . i am not on a diet although i try to eat healthy foods lots of veggies and no ""snack foods"" i get plenty of sleep at night but i still feel tired all day. my life is not highly stressful. no matter how much i eat in a meal or how often i eat i'm hungry constantly even immediately after eating.",it sounds like your diet may be out of balance. make sure to include 3-5 food groups with main meals and 2-3 with snacks (lean protein whole grains fruit vegetables dairy healthy fats). for example a salad with veggies and dressing includes vegetables and healthy fats but that alone is usually not enough to keep you full. so add a protein source to it (beans/chicken) and round it a piece of whole grain bread and a side of yogurt. the goal is to include foods with a high satiety value meaning they take longer to digest and keep you fuller longer. here are some ways to increase the satiety power of your meals: make sure most of your meals have a source of protein. protein is the most filling of the macronutrients (carbohydrates protein and fat). so include nuts on your cereal a boiled egg or chicken on salads and build your dinner meals around a lean protein source. include healthy fats with your meals. fat also helps to slow digestion and is satisfying. try chopped avocado on salads nuts topped on yogurt and veggies sauteed in olive oil. a healthy fat source at every meal will increase satisfaction. fiber-rich foods are also filling. include fruits and veggies with meals (as you have) whole grains beans/legumes and nuts and seeds. while it's great to eat healthy make sure you eat meals you enjoy that also taste good. that include sweets in moderation. a small piece of dark chocolate or cookie after a meal can increase satisfaction and help keep cravings at bay. keep trying different things until you find meals that are not only healthy but satisfying. i am not an expert and am only answering from my own experience. even back to when i was younger i can remember always being hungry and always eating. people used to comment on how much i ate and that i didn't gain an ounce. i also try to eat healthy and love vegetables. two years ago i was diagnosed with hypoglycemia- low blood sugar- not due to diabetes. especially around the time of my period my blood sugar is hard to control. i feel like i'm starving and of course crave chocolate! i usually give in and then that starts a viscious cycle with my blood sugars. i try to have a variety of vegetables fruits cheeses peanut butter and whole grain snacks (wheat thins triscuits etc) on hand. so if you are feeling the signs- shaky dizzy weak grouchy feel like you could eat a freakin' cow lol! . you may want to have your blood sugars tested. you say that you sleep all night and are still tired the next day. i had this problem for years and it turned out that i have sleep apnea. sleep apnea interferes with rem sleep and though it seems that you sleep all night you are waking up a lot. sleep deprivation due to sleep apnea or for any other reason can cause an imbalance in leptin and grehlin. these hormones affect appetite. i would eat a big supper and in an hour i was physically hungry again and wanting to eat another full meal. i gained 15 pounds in about 3 months before i got treatment for the apnea. you might ask your doctor to assess you for sleep apnea or other sleep problems. you could have low blood sugar or low blood pressure. you might need to go to the doctor for some blood tests. also i have the same problem too. the doctor told me it could be my medication for my thyroid condition. how are you doing with your issue? i feel like this is really rare and you probably would know by now if you have this. prader-willi syndrome will give you an unsatisfiable craving for food (if you are born with this you will have had this eating problem your whole life).,"['hunger', 'snack', 'food', 'meal', 'healthy eating']",wmd

does your hair grow thicker while you are pregnant?,some people do notice that their hair can be thicker and fuller when pregnant and this is a hormonal fluctuation. so what happens is that your hair has three cycles of growth: it has a growing phase a resting phase and a falling out phase. sometimes with the hormones and the changes in pregnancy your hair stays in that growing phase longer. so you have more hair in that growing phase so your hair looks thicker and fuller and grows longer and often is more shiny as well. what happens though is three to four months after pregnancy when those cycle shift back all of a sudden that hair starts to shed as you revert back to your normal hair cycles. so if all your hair grew in the growing phase at the same time and then shifted to the resting phase every two to ten years or so you would go bald completely. but fortunately that pattern is not synchronized. so about 90% of your hair is growing and 10% is resting or falling out. so if that patterns shifts you might notice that your hair looks fuller for a while but there is a price to pay on the other side and then it will balance back out. yes mine did. and then after i had my baby girl i lost quite a bit of it ,['pregnancy'],wmd

what is a cataract?,a cataract is a clouding of the lens in the eye that affects vision. most cataracts are related to aging. cataracts are very common in older people. by age 80 more than half of all americans either have a cataract or have had cataract surgery. a cataract can occur in either or both eyes. it cannot spread from one eye to the other. what is the lens? the lens is a clear part of the eye that helps to focus light or an image on the retina. the retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. in a normal eye light passes through the transparent lens to the retina. once it reaches the retina light is changed into nerve signals that are sent to the brain. the lens must be clear for the retina to receive a sharp image. if the lens is cloudy from a cataract the image you see will be blurred. are there other types of cataract? yes. although most cataracts are related to aging there are other types of cataracts: secondary cataract. cataracts can form after surgery for other eye problems such as glaucoma. cataracts also can develop in people who have other health problems such as diabetes. cataracts are sometimes linked to steroid use. traumatic cataract. cataracts can develop after an eye injury sometimes years later. congenital cataract. some babies are born with cataracts or develop them in childhood often in both eyes. these cataracts may be so small that they do not affect vision. if they do the lenses may need to be removed. radiation cataract. cataracts can develop after exposure to some types of radiation.,['cataract'],wmd

how can i control my cravings?,avoid using your pregnancy as a reason to overeat or to choose low-nutrient high-fat foods over more nutritious fare. giving in too often to pregnancy cravings for high-fat calorie-laden foods such as bacon double cheeseburgers and brownie sundaes can lead to unnecessary weight gain. and it may program your child to prefer unhealthier food choices. a 2007 study in the british journal of nutrition suggests that women who regularly feast on so-called junk food during pregnancy may have children with a propensity for becoming overweight later in life because they prefer the taste of foods rich in sugar fat and calories. a salt-laden diet won't pack on fat but may cause you to retain fluid which will show up on the scale as extra weight. excess fluid may cause discomfort and aggravate high blood pressure. to control cravings for any food prevent yourself from getting too hungry. eat meals and snacks on a regular basis during the day and be sure to combine a source of protein such as hard-cooked eggs and low-fat yogurt with complex carbohydrates including whole-grain breads and cereals. that's not to say your diet must be treat-free. even the healthiest pregnancy eating plan can include moderate portions of the foods you crave but not every day.,['craving'],wmd

what is the best motivations that will get you started on your diet i tried so many things but failed  plz help me. i am on this weight loss with a friend and we are finding it very hard to start. we have looked up all the information needed for weight loss and we set up our goals and meals and exercising but all of this is not going to happened if 'we cant start the diet because we feel like we cant do it and we are just so addicted to food'. anyone have a solution to this problem please help. thank you ,"well it's a good question. motivation is the challenge of every person who wants to achieve a goal be it weight loss becoming an oil painter or anything else. it sounds like you may have invested too much time and effort into research. everything feels overwhelming to you right now doesn't it? don't let that stop you. at a certain point you have to take the plunge and do it. stop thinking about it and just do it. i read an interesting article in which a fitness coach said there is no such thing as ""motivation;"" there are only choices. you can choose to eat an apple or you can choose to eat a candy bar. you can choose to take a walk for 10 minutes or you can choose to watch tv instead. do you see the difference here? i strongly suggest you and your friend check out webmd's diet community where you can share your fears struggles goals and successes with others who will cheer you on! you are not the first person to fear getting started on the path to a healthy life and you won't be the last. meanwhile choose goals you know you can easily accomplish. for example: today i will eat one apple instead of a candy bar today i will throw away all the junk food in my house today i will walk for 10 minutes this week i will walk for 10 minutes every day i mean come on! anyone can do 10 minutes of exercise right? of course you can! lastly don't forget to reward yourself for meeting your goals no matter how small they may be. don't use food as a reward. even if you accomplish just one thing today download a new song to your smartphone take a bubble bath or do something else to celebrate the fact that today at least you won. you don't need ""motivation. "" you just need to take the plunge. i say go for it! wishing you well! there are no magic solutions to motivation but i am pleased that you are doing this with a friend. how about a bet? put some money on the line ($100? ) or house-cleaning (if someone fails to meet their goal they have to clean the other person's house). keep in fun and make sure your goals are reasonable and achievable. start with control. cut out the things you know you are not supposed to eat and stop buying them. write down everything you eat for about a week or so (be honest! ) and try to determine the number of calories you are ingesting. make sure you are under 15 calories per pound of ideal body weight (your goal). any one can lose weight. there is only mismatched strategies. something tells me that you are on your way to success. i suggest that you discuss your diet objectives with a physician and also your significant other. your doctor has had positive experience in knowing what diets work and which diets usually do not work. they also will know what is the best diet for you as an individual. your medical professional is in partnership with you to ensure dietary efficacy and safety. your significant other in life is also probably your best friend will be a cheerleader in your corner and most likely will offer you the motivating support system that is routinely missing with most diets. the diet that boasts the greatest statistical success is probably ""weight watchers"". counting points is relatively easy the food is easy to obtain and online supports are built into the dietary system. do not skip meals drink plenty of water and negotiate rewards for yourself (such as new clothing) upon reaching pivotal goals. if you have a dietary setback don't let it be your reason to throw in the towel. as the old chinese proverb suggests.

how much should i weigh?,doctors nutritionists and public health authorities most often use the body mass index to define a healthy weight. body mass index (bmi) is your weight in kilograms divided by the square of your height in meters (kg/m2). according to the cdc a bmi of less than 18. 5 is considered underweight. a normal bmi falls within the range of 18. 5 to 24. 9. the bmi range of 25. 0 to 29. 9 is considered overweight and a bmi of 30. 0 or higher is considered obese. . obesity increases the risk for diabetes high blood pressure heart attack stroke certain cancers. losing weight reduces your risk. waist size matters too. even in people who are only slightly overweight a waist circumference greater than 40 inches in men and 35 inches in women increases health risks. dont believe your pant size; it often underestimates waist circumference. measure your waist yourself with a tape measure just below the belly button.,[],wmd
is it possible to have bladder leakage during sex? it can be continuous leakage at times.,"yes it is possible. urologists seem to believe that it is linked to genuine stress incontinence rather than the urge type of urinary incontinence. if the amount of loss is not large or does not seem to be urine your may be having the controversial diagnosis of ""female ejaculation"". apparent female ejaculation has been long debated in the medical and sex therapy literature. there is an anatomic area analogous to the male prostate which is located behind the anterior vaginal wall (ie area reputed to be the female ""g spot""). this is supposed to be the source of some type of fluid which is ejected. . . given that your leakage is continuous it may well be urine. i would urge you see a urologist for a more ""for sure"" diagnosis. can you have intercourse if you have prolapsed bladder.","['sexual intercourse', 'bladder']",wmd

i banged my thumb months ago and have had a black bruise under the nail since then. why has this not gotten better?,it probably has gotten better. i am assuming that nail is no longer sore swollen or painful correct? this is called a subungual hematoma  a pocket of blood that formed under the nail from the injury. in most cases this blood will eventually be reabsorbed by the body and/or the nail will slowly grow out taking this black spot with it. in your case the black spot is likely dried blood on the nail bed that cannot be reabsorbed or is being s l o w l y reabsorbed. this innocent cosmetic imperfection can last quite a while so you may have to cover it up with nail polish (i am guessing from your screen name that you are female). should you ever have a similar crush injury of your nails in the future the pocket can be removed by a tiny bore hole in the nail (surprisingly painless) when it is fresh. this will improve the pain and reduce this slow healing process that you are experiencing now. the nail can be surgically removed but that may be a bit drastic.,"['bruise', 'nail', 'thumb']",wmd

are ear infections contagious?,an ear infection happens when germs such as viruses or bacteria get into the middle ear. this can often happen during or after your child has a cold or runny nose. middle ear infections are very common and occur a lot in kids under 4 because of their ear tubes being smaller. many of these ear infections go away by themselves and some may need antibiotics. because the ear infection is in the middle ear it is not contagious. if the infection is in the outer ear the part closest to the ear lobe it is called an outer ear infection. outer ear infections can occur after kids swim. these are not contagious either and usually just need some antibiotic eardrops to make them get better. if you think your child has an ear infection see your doctor. but remember it will get better soon!,[],wmd
which helps me lose weight most quickly exercising at a lower rate or a faster paced workout?,at lower intensities of exercise muscles burn a higher percentage of fat than carbohydrates but not necessarily more total fat or more total calories than at higher intensities. this is a subtle distinction but it's an important one. you get more bang for the buck when muscles burn fat compared with carbohydrates because fat has more than twice the number of calories (nine calories vs. four calories per gram). muscles need more oxygen to burn fat compared with carbohydrates because fat is denser. less oxygen reaches the muscle when you exercise hard or fast and get out of breath. the term sucking wind means that you are working hard to get more oxygen in. when less oxygen reaches the muscles a situation known as oxygen debt carbohydrates become the preferred fuel because they burn completely with less oxygen. with the above information in mind the problem with exercising slowly and at a lower heart rate to burn more fat is that you end up burning fewer total calories and less total fat. consider the following example. let's say you walk for one hour on a treadmill at 3. 0 miles per hour (mph). if you weigh 150 pounds then in one hour you burn approximately 300 calories (a 150-pound person burns 100 calories per mile) and if you walk at 4. 0 mph for one hour then you burn 400 calories. now let's say you burn 70 percent of your calories from fat at 3. 0 mph. that would be. 70 x 300 or 210 calories from fat. now let's say you burn 60 percent of your calories from fat at 4. 0 mph. that would be. 60 x 400 or 240 calories from fat. you can see that at 4. 0 mph you burn less fat by percent but more total fat (and more total calories). as for which form of exercise (slow or fast) will help you lose weight faster it's important to know that to lose weight you must consume fewer calories than you burn no matter how much exercise you do. even if you run a marathon every day you will not lose any weight if you consume more calories than you burn. so whether it's fast or slow exercise you still must consume fewer calories than you burn to lose weight. and just for the record exercise is the single best predictor of maintaining weight loss (it's pretty much guaranteed that you will regain lost weight if you remain sedentary) but the more efficient way of losing weight is to reduce your calorie intake. you should maximize the calorie burn during your workouts as long as you keep it within your physical limits and don't risk injury. this burns more calories and contributes some to weight loss but even more importantly it makes you more aerobically fit. and the more aerobically fit you are the more efficient the muscles will be at burning fat and burning more calories overall.,"['exercise', 'diet', 'workout']",wmd

does himalayan salt contain iodine?,"raw salt of any kind from any source does not contain iodine. this includes sea salt rock salt and any other natural form of salt. salt distributors began adding iodine to sodium chloride (table salt) around the 1920s when scientists discovered iodine is essential to thyroid health. when the thyroid gland doesn't get enough iodine it grows very large. this is called 'goiter. ' one hundred years ago it was not uncommon to see people walking around with huge goiters due to lack of iodine in their diet. iodine is not found in many vegetables or other foods (seaweed is the notable exception). companies began adding iodine to salt in the 1920s because almost everyone uses salt in cooking. adding iodine to salt offered a way to make sure people got enough iodine to satisfy the requirements of their thyroid gland. salt with added iodine is called ""iodized"" salt. it's important for most people to eat iodized salt at least occasionally in order to maintain thyroid health. if you don't have thyroid problems you don't need to eat iodized salt all the time. you can use fancy salt like himalayan rock salt. but try to get iodine occasionally since it's an essential nutrient. wishing you well!","['salt', 'iodine']",wmd

can u get pregnant on the pill? . i have been taking the pill for 2 months now and my last peroid wasnt really a period. i bled for maybe 5 minutes a day for 3 days. could i be pregnant? i just started feeling nausea and im hungry but when i start eating i feel like i cant eat,"the answer is yes the only form of birth control that is 100% effective is complete abstinence. the effectiveness of the pill is very user dependent. typically about 8 women out of 100 that use bcp's will get pregnant during the first year of use. however when used as directed only about 1 in 100 women get pregnant. remember that this degree of effectiveness with the pill depends on you taking the pill exactly as directed and at the same time of day every day. abnormal or breakthrough bleeding is common during the first few months of use and its very normal. this typically is just an adjustment that the body needs to make to the newer levels of hormones. the duration of this abnormal bleeding pattern depends on the type of bcp you use and often can last much longer in women taking continuous dose pills. to ease your mind get a pregnancy test done. many over the counter tests can detect pregnancy as early as 6-7 days before a misssed period. also remember that bcp's don't protect against std's so if you are sexually active use a backup method like a condom. there is always a possibility that any kind of birth control besides not having sex will fail. so it is definitely possible that women can get pregnant while on the pill. it is definitely possible to get pregnant while on the pill especially if you have only been on it for a couple months (your body may not have absorbed and reacted to the hormones at a ""normal"" speed) you should take a pregnancy test very soon. if it is negative take one more 1-2 weeks later. if they are both negative it is possible these are just side-effects of how you react to this specific birth control. if it continues to be bothersome or gets worse go to the doctor. have a proffessional pregnancy test done and (asuming it is still negative) discuss changing your contraceptive method. yes my 14 month old son is proof that you can get pregnant on the pill. as my doctor told me its only 99. 9% effective it may be that you are pregnant. feeling nausea.","['period', 'pregnancy', 'nausea', 'hunger']",wmd

why is a power down hour important to good sleep?,one of the things i talk about in my book is having whats called a powered down hour. and in the power down hour you have 3 twenty minute segments. so the first segment is forgetting stuff done that you just have to get done or it will drive you crazy. so in our house its getting backpacks ready for school finding shoes you know things that you do when you have kids. the second twenty minutes is reserved for hygiene so brush your teeth wash your face maybe even take a hot shower or bath. the final twenty minutes is reserved for meditation relaxation stretching things of that nature that id want you to do in bed and id want you to do it in the dark okay. because what that does is again it sets that mood and allows you to start to fall asleep. now many people dont have an hour before they get into bed so you can do the power down half hour if you want like 10 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes.,[],wmd

my breasts grow/shrink by 2 cup sizes every few months. not period related pregnant or weight gain. ultrasound normal. i am 25 and this has been happening sense i was 19. i have not been on birth control for 2 years. i am not pregnant. the times they grown/shrink are random and don't appear to be related to my period at all. my primary care doctor is baffled and can't figure this out. i had an ultrasound that came back normal so they won't do a mammogram. i gave blood to test my hormones and they came back normal. while they grow/shrink they are sore and painful to the touch. what is wrong with me?,hi just been doing a little bit more research and found this small piece of info see when you start doing research as you know you have to fight your way through lots of rubbish but this come out of the rubbish you may like to copy it and show your doctor of all things its from the uk's daily mail its a daily news paper see what you think. breast size is essentially determined by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. while genes are beyond our control lifestyle modifications may be effective in reducing bust size. the main hormone that determines breast size is oestrogen. the more oestrogen you have in your system the bigger your breasts will tend to be. this is why women often find that their breasts enlarge when they take oestrogen-based medication such as the 'combined' pill (a mix of oestrogen and progesterone) or hrt. as far reducing your bust size is concerned i would therefore advise you to avoid using the combined pill. in addition it is important for you to be aware that traces of oestrogen from the pill are excreted in the urine and may make it into the water supply. oestrogen-like compounds (also known as 'xeno-oestrogens') from plastic packaging (including plastic bottles) and industrial residues are also known to contaminate food and drinks. for these reasons i would advise you to drink mineral water from glass bottles whenever possible and avoid processed foods packaged in plastic. meat and possibly some dairy products tend to contain oestrogen and should also be moderated in the diet. oestrogen is broken down in the liver so anything you do to improve liver function might help. eating a diet based on wholefoods fruits and vegetables (preferably organic) with plenty of water and very little caffeine and alcohol should help to maximise your liver function and minimise the impact of oestrogen in your body. you might also try a supplement of the herb agnus castus. one of this herb's chief effects is to increase the level of the hormone progesterone which tends to help moderate and balance the effects of oestrogen in the body. the normal recommended dose of agnus castus is 40 mg of dried herb or 40 drops of concentrated liquid extract once a day or 20 mg of dried herb twice a day. agnus castus preparations are readily available in health food stores. its the part on the liver that could point the way to your problem perhaps something is going wrong there when it comes to your hormones. good luck,"['breast', 'period', 'pregnancy', 'weight gain', 'birth control']",wmd

when do you use dextromethorphan vs guaifenesin,dextromethorophan is a cough suppressant; guaifenesin is a mucous-thinning medication that can actually increase a cough. if you goal is to stop/control a cough especially at night then dextromethorophan (assuming it is not included in a combination product containing a decongestant) is what you would use. if you goal is to thin a cough so that a person can spit it up then guaifenesin (during the day) would be helpful if the person is capable of coughing up phlegm. children often cannot do this. guaifenesin at bedtime will most likely increase the cough because of post-nasal drainage.,[],wmd

what are some of the additional problems that can occur in a pregnancy after age 35?,chronic health problems such as diabetes or high blood pressure are more common in women in their 30s and 40s. be sure to get these conditions under control before you become pregnant since they pose risks to both you and your baby. careful medical monitoring begun before conception and continued throughout your pregnancy can reduce the risks associated with these conditions. high blood pressure and diabetes can develop for the first time during pregnancy and women over the age of 30 are at increased risk. if you are pregnant and over age 35 this makes it especially important that you get early and regular prenatal care to ensure early diagnosis and proper treatment. stillbirth (delivery of a baby that has died before birth) is more common in women over age 35. older women are also more likely to have low-birth weight babies (weighing less than 5. 5 pounds at birth). cesarean birth is also slightly more common for women having their first child after age 35.,['pregnancy'],wmd

how can type 1 diabetes be prevented?,preventing type 1 diabetes currently there is no way to prevent type 1 diabetes but ongoing studies are exploring ways to prevent diabetes in those who are most likely to develop it. people who have a parent brother or sister with type 1 diabetes and are willing to participate in one of these studies should talk with their doctors. they may want to be tested for islet cell antibodies because if they have these antibodies they are more likely to get diabetes. vaccines have not been found to contribute to the development of type 1 diabetes. 4 children who are at risk for developing diabetes still need to get the recommended immunizations. see the childhood immunization schedule recommended by the u. s. advisory committee on immunization practices the american academy of pediatrics and the american academy of family physicians. preventing diabetes complications people with type 1 diabetes can help prevent or delay the development of complications such as eye kidney heart blood vessel and nerve diseases by keeping their blood sugar near normal levels. they also need regular medical checkups to detect early signs of complications. if complications are treated early the damage may be stopped slowed or possibly reversed. people who have other health problems along with diabetes such as high blood pressure or high cholesterol need to treat those conditions. also not smoking can reduce the risk of complications. having other health problems can increase the risk for complications from diabetes. preventing flu and pneumococcal disease people who have diabetes should have a flu shot every year and a pneumococcal vaccine. usually people need only one dose of the pneumococcal vaccine. but doctors sometimes recommend a second dose for some people especially if they have a long-term disease. talk with your doctor about whether you need a second dose. the pneumococcal vaccine helps prevent infections caused by pneumococcal bacteria. people with diabetes especially those who have heart or kidney disease are at high risk for complications hospitalization and death from flu and pneumococcal disease. 5 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,['type 1 diabetes'],wmd

3 questions: does pheromone sprays work does ion/power bracelets work does penis enlargement pills/exercises work?,"no these are all basically worthless ""quack"" gimmicks. don't waste your time or money. pheromones are real but as far as i know human pheromones have not been successfully tested for efficacy. you really can't spray an expensive substance on your skin and expect the others to be magically attracted to you and offer themselves for unbridled sex. while subtle smells are important a potential partner will likely be more attracted to a nice smile and a pleasant personality not how you smell. human pheromones are in sweat but i don't suggest that you try to attract someone with stinky body odor. ion and power bracelets are absolutely worthless. period. there are no pills or vitamins that will increase the size of your penis. your penis reaches it maximum size by age 17 and there is no substance that can make your penis feet or hands bigger. many men feel their penises are smaller but in controlled studies of zillions of men the size of the penis (when erect) does not vary that much. devices like hanging weights on this delicate member that claim the penis can be enlarged do not work and are potentially dangerous. sexual performance is an art and the most skilled artists do not use large paintbrushes or rollers. the most important sex organ is your brain. enlargement pills do not work. the only thing i have heard that helps with size is a penis pump. just be careful though. these are pretty rough on the penis skin. it's best to use a penis skin moisturizer while using one. man1 man oil is an excellent creme. you can get it online. good luck.","['penis', 'exercise']",wmd

can i do pilates if i have osteroporosis?,"if you have low bone density or osteoporosis you can still make pilates a part of your regular exercise program. however you should avoid or modify certain movements to prevent too much stress on your spine ribs and hips. it's important to work with an instructor who is knowledgeable about osteoporosis to develop a program that is safe and appropriate for your individual needs. here are some tips: avoid flexion of the spine many movements in pilates involve flexion or bending which causes the back to round into a c-curve. forward flexion brings the head and shoulders closer to the abdomen. people with osteoporosis or low bone density should avoid or modify movements with flexion. the most common pilates exercise that involves forward flexion is called ""the hundred. "" the position of the head neck and back are not safe if you have low bone density or osteoporosis. other exercises that involve flexion or bending include ab prep and scissors. you can modify these movements by keeping your head down. this will actually make these exercises more challenging. you should not feel pain in your lower back. only do what you are comfortable with. if you have low bone density or osteoporosis you should avoid pilates movements that involve flexion of the spine and cannot be modified. some of the exercises to avoid include: roll up rolling like a ball seal criss cross teaser roll over shoulder stand saw spine stretch jackknife bicycle boomerang double leg stretch single leg stretch open leg rocker crab corkscrew and neck pull. choose extension exercises people with osteoporosis or low bone density should focus on extension exercises. these include exercises that involve backward bending. some examples are: breast stroke prep one leg kick breast stroke double leg kick swan and swimming. you can put a pillow under your lowest ribs to protect them when lying face down. be careful with exercises that involve side bending and twisting a little side bending and twisting is fine but you should not push yourself to a point of strain. keep these movements small. when bending and twisting it is important to keep your spine as straight as possible. to do this imagine you are standing against a wall with your head middle back and buttocks touching the wall. you should only have a slight curve inward in your lower back. when doing movements with bending and twisting your instructor can help you make sure your form is correct.","['osteoporosis', 'pilates']",wmd

my 17-year-old has stopped taking concerta after 10 years. what affect will this have on his adhd?,seventy percent of teens diagnosed when they are younger continue to have symptoms of their adhd that affect their functioning as adolescents. once your son stops taking his medication (concerta) his symptoms will return relatively quickly. unless he has learned other compensatory techniques or has outside help his symptoms will affect both his academic performance in school and his relationships with others. if he is driving he may have more difficulty focusing and with distractibility. teens with untreated adhd tend to have more car accidents and get more speeding tickets. all of this should be explained to him and i would suggest that he go in for a visit to discuss this and his decision to stop his medication with his health care provider. i often use this situation as an opportunity for the teen to learn more about how his adhd affects him and why or whether he need to continue his medication to treat his symptoms.,['attention deficit hyperactivity disorder'],wmd

is it safe to take ibuprofen with vicodin? or is tylenol safer?,please do not take tylenol ( acetaminophen ) with vicodin (hydrocodone-apap) because vicodin contains tylenol already. it is very easy to exceed the maximum daily limit of acetaminophen by combining these two drugs. and high doses of acetaminophen may lead to liver damage. if the hydrocodone isn't controlling your pain i'd suggest you speak with your health care provider. from a pharmacology standpoint there's no harm in combining ibuprofen with hydrocodone but ibuprofen is a blood thinner. so if you're taking hydrocodone to control post-surgical pain for example your doctor may not want you taking a blood thinner like ibuprofen. also your health care provider may not want you taking ibuprofen based on other medications you currently take your past medical history and many other factors. so in a nutshell i'd suggest you simply put a call in to your provider for guidance on what medications are safe for you to take for pain control. wishing you all the best! vicodin which is a combination of acetaminophen (the active ingredient in tylenol) and hydrocodone. long-term effects on the body from products that contain acetaminophen can lead to severe liver damage and liver failure. gallus detox center is a private inpatient medical detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929.,['ibuprofen'],wmd

does dehydration cause anxiety and depression?,hi for a start many things can contribute to anxiety and anxiety symptoms. in some cases these issues may cause anxiety directly. in other cases your anxiety symptoms may simply become worse. either way in order to effectively cure your anxiety you need to make sure you're avoiding anything that may contribute to the development of anxiety symptoms. that's why you need to make sure that you're drinking enough water. dehydration rarely causes anxiety on its own but if you're not drinking enough water you may be putting yourself at risk for worse anxiety symptoms now and the development of greater anxiety in the future. part of curing anxiety is making sure that you're taking the right steps towards stopping everything that contributes to further anxiety. drinking water is a great example. so its best you do stay hydrated. i do hope this helps you. good luck,"['dehydration', 'anxiety', 'depression']",wmd

what kind of quick healthy meal can i make with beans?,one of my favorite dishes is white bean stew with beef or lamb garlic and sage. it includes the simplest of ingredients and preparation but is so satisfying. if you have access to white cannellini beans (canned or in a jar) at your store that is my favorite type of white bean to use. if not you can use a white navy bean. beans are one of the few items out of a can that i fully encourage to use. most of us dont have time to make beans from their dried form. having extra cans in the pantry allows for a weeknight dinner in less than 20 minutes of cook time and about five minutes of prep time. first you will want to get beef lamb or pork and cut into two-inch chunks. (you can buy stew meat or a more tender piece of meat like the loin). if you use a stew meat note that the meat will have a chewier texture than if you were to make a dish that you slow cook for hours. for me i dont mind this texture for the time i save. you will need a pot that can hold two cans of beans and about one pound of meat. first salt and pepper your meat. heat a bit of extra virgin olive oil in the pan and brown your meat. at this point you can add fresh chopped garlic (about a tablespoon) and sage (about a tablespoon). you can substitute rosemary or thyme or do a combination of the three. add firmer vegetables like potatoes and carrots after the meat. from there you will add your rinsed beans and a 1/2 cup of broth or water. you can get creative with what type of veggie you want to add. i like to take a head of dinosaur kale and cut it into one-inch strips or a few cups of baby spinach and add this at the end. small cut-up carrots and or celery works as well. cook everything together for 15-20 minutes over medium heat. if you are using kale or spinach add it in about five minutes before you are done with cooking time. you are then ready for a quick healthy and delicious comfort meal.,['meal'],wmd

how is prostate cancer diagnosed and graded?,prostate cancer is diagnosed from the results of a biopsy of the prostate gland. if the digital rectal exam of the prostate or the psa blood test is abnormal a prostate cancer is suspected. a biopsy of the prostate is usually then recommended. the biopsy is done from the rectum (trans-rectally) and is guided by ultrasound images of the area. a small piece of prostate tissue is withdrawn through a cutting needle. the trus-guided tru-cut biopsy is currently the standard method to diagnose prostate cancer. although initially a 6-core set was the standard currently most experts advocate sampling a minimum of 10 to 12 pieces of the prostate to improve the chances of detection of the cancer and also to provide a better idea regarding the extent and areas of involvement within the prostate. multiple pieces are taken by sampling the base apex and mid gland on each side of the gland. more cores may be sampled to increase the yield especially in larger glands. a pathologist a specialist physician who analyzes tissue samples under a microscope then examines the pieces under the microscope to assess the type of cancer present in the prostate and the extent of involvement of the prostate with the tumor. one also can get an idea about the areas of the prostate that are involved by the tumor by assessing which of the pieces contain the cancer and which of them do not. another very important assessment that the pathologist makes form the specimen is the grade (gleason's score) of the tumor. this indicates how different the cancer cells are from normal prostate tissue. grade gives an indication of how fast a cancer is likely to grow and has very important implications on the treatment plan and the chances of cure after treatment. a gleason score of six is supposed to indicate low-grade (less aggressive) disease while that of eight to 10 demonstrates high grade (more aggressive) cancer; seven is regarded as somewhere in between these two.,['prostate cancer'],wmd

why are our veins blue,and a simple one to answer. our blood circulation system consists of arteries which carry oxygen-rich blood to the tissues and veins which return oxygen-depleted blood back to the heart and lungs. oxygen-rich blood tends to look bright red. blood carrying less oxygen tends to look dark red. veins carry dark red blood. the reason your veins look bluish is because they lie under skin and fatty tissue which distorts the color of the blood to our eyes. the blood in those veins is indeed red but because of the overlying tissue the veins appear bluish. i hope this answers your question!,['vein'],wmd

what is a typical heart rate for the baby when just starting six weeks?,many people don't realize infants have a faster heart rate than adults. a lot of people think a baby's heart rate should be slower than an adult's because a baby is so much smaller but actually the opposite is true. a normal infant (age 1 to 12 months) heart rate is between 80 and 140 beats per minute. as your baby gets older his or her pulse rate will gradually slow down. a normal adult heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute. whenever you have questions about your baby's vital signs you can always check with your pediatrician. these are great questions to ask and can help you better assess physical changes in your baby when he or she is sick. wishing you well!,['baby'],wmd

are there any dietary deficiencies associated with celiac disease?,patients with celiac disease are at risk for some nutritional deficiencies including folate deficiency b12 deficiency and iron deficiency. celiac disease patients are also at risk of developing low bone mineral density (osteoporosis). there are two reasons for nutritional deficiencies in celiac disease patients: the diseased small intestine causes a lack of absorption of vitamins and nutrients. strict gluten restriction can also lead to nutritional deficiencies. many of the gluten-free foods are not fortified or enriched with vitamins or minerals. studies have also shown that gluten-free products are often low in b vitamins calcium vitamin d iron zinc magnesium and fiber. fortunately there are blood tests that your physician can do to determine if you are deficient in any nutrients. it's important to be aware of what deficiencies you are at risk for and to make every effort to avoid these deficiencies. the deficiency in nutrients does not mean a deficiency in calories. there is an increased incidence of obesity in persons with celiac disease who are following a gluten-free diet. the dietary goal is to follow a well-balanced diet with appropriate supplements when needed and an adequate amount of calories for maintaining a healthy weight.,['celiac disease'],wmd

how is coronary artery disease treated?,"angina medications reduce the heart muscle's demand for oxygen in order to compensate for the reduced blood supply and also may partially widen the coronary arteries to enhance blood flow. three commonly used classes of drugs are nitrates beta blockers and calcium blockers. examples of nitrates include isosorbide (isordil) isosorbide mononitrate (imdur) and transdermal nitrate patches. examples of beta blockers include propranolol (inderal) atenolol (tenormin) and metoprolol (lopressor). examples of calcium blockers include nifedipine (procardia adalat) verapamil (calan verelan verelan pm isoptin isoptin sr covera-hs) diltiazem (cardizem dilacor tiazac) and amlodipine (norvasc). many patients benefit from these angina medications and experience reduction of angina during exertion. when significant ischemia still occurs either with ongoing symptoms or with exercise testing coronary arteriography is usually performed often followed by either pci or cabg. patients with unstable angina have severe coronary artery narrowing and often are at imminent risk of a heart attack. in addition to angina medications they are given aspirin and the intravenous blood thinner heparin. a form of heparin enoxaparin (lovenox) may be administered under the skin and has been demonstrated to be as effective as intravenous heparin in patients with unstable angina. aspirin prevents clumping of blood clotting elements called platelets while heparin prevents blood from clotting on the surface of plaques. newer potent iv anti-platelet drugs (""super aspirins"") are also available to help stabilize such patients. while patients with unstable angina may have their symptoms temporarily controlled with these potent medications they are often at risk for heart attacks. for this reason many patients with unstable angina are referred for coronary angiography and possible pci or cabg. pci can produce excellent results in carefully selected patients who may have one or more severely narrowed artery segments which are suitable for balloon dilatation stenting or atherectomy. during pci a local anesthetic is injected into the skin over the artery in the groin or arm. the artery is punctured with a needle and a plastic sheath is placed into the artery. under x-ray guidance (fluoroscopy) a long thin plastic tube called a guiding catheter is advanced through the sheath to the origin of the coronary artery from the aorta. a contrast dye containing iodine is injected through the guiding catheter so that x-ray images of the coronary arteries can be obtained. a small diameter guide wire (0. 014 inches) is threaded through the coronary artery narrowing or blockage. a balloon catheter is then advanced over the guide wire to the site of the obstruction. this balloon is then inflated for about one minute compressing the plaque and enlarging the opening of the coronary artery. balloon inflation pressures may vary from as little as one or two atmospheres of pressure to as much as 20 atmospheres. finally the balloon is deflated and removed from the body. intracoronary stents either self-expand or most commonly they are delivered over a conventional angioplasty balloon. when the balloon is inflated the stent is expanded and deployed and the balloon is removed. the stent remains in place in the artery. atherectomy devices are inserted into the coronary artery over a standard angioplasty guide wire and then activated depending on the device chosen. cabg surgery is performed to relieve angina in patients whose illness has not responded to medications and who are not good candidates for balloon angioplasty. cabg is best performed in patients with multiple blockages in multiple locations or when blockages are located in certain arterial segments that are not well-suited for pci. cabg is often also used in patients who have failed to attain long-term success following one or more pci procedures. cabg surgery has been shown to improve long- term survival in patients with significant narrowing of the left main coronary artery and in patients with significant narrowing in multiple arteries especially in those with decreased heart muscle pump function.",['heart disease'],wmd

which exercises are best for people with osteoporosis?,osteoporosis is a disease characterized by loss of bone that increases the risk of fracture particularly in the wrist spine and hip. exercise can have a positive effect on bone mineral density and the strength of bone but it is a complicated relationship because of many factors including genetics age gender hormone and menopause status activity level and nutrient deficiencies. age applies to everyone when it comes to the effect of exercise on building bone strength. in youth the time of peak bone mineral content velocity (the time around puberty when bone rapidly forms) is an important time for children and early teens to be exercising because: 1. research shows that increases in estrogen in girls helps bone form (puberty is when estrogen rises) and exercise added during this time enhances the effect on bone density. 2. research shows that active youth have higher bone density than inactive children. 3. research suggests that denser bone formed during childhood may track into adulthood. that is if children and teens exercise enough to create denser bones than their sedentary peers then they may have thicker bones as adults. as for young adults it is generally believed that peak bone density is reached by the time we reach our late 20s or early 30s and research suggests that athletes in this age group have higher bone mineral density than sedentary individuals. for middle-aged and older adults bone density decreases by about 5% per decade after the age of 40. some scientists believe that during these times of life it may not be realistic to expect substantial increases in bone density but rather we should expect a reduction or attenuation of the loss of bone that we experience as we age. these scientists may be right because there is little evidence that walking weight lifting or any other type of exercise substantially increases bone density in older adults. what you can say with some certainty is that active individuals in these age groups do maintain their bone density while their sedentary peers do not. and that's a good thing. equally important for older adults in terms of osteoporosis is the effect of exercise on the risk of falling. when individuals with osteoporosis fall they typically break bones and in fact sometimes the bones are so brittle that they break before the person hits the ground; for example just stepping off a curb could break a brittle bone in the hip and then the individual falls as a result. people fall for many reasons including poor balance poor vision decreased strength and range of motion and cognitive impairments like dementia. exercise can't help every factor but studies show that exercises such as balance training (e. g. tai chi) leg strengthening and flexibility training (e. g. yoga) can reduce the risk of falling in older adults. as for which exercises are best for people with osteoporosis the simple answer is: 1. weight-bearing exercises that cause force on the bones like jogging stair climbing and walking briskly. 2. resistance exercises that involve the bones you are concerned about. 3. balance exercises if you are an older adult. research is clear that you need some force-loading or weight-bearing on bones to have any effect on density and strength but caution should be taken with exercise when you have osteoporosis. you should avoid: 1. exercises that might increase the risk of falling. 2. movements like twisting of the spine and bending from the waist. 3. high-impact activities like high-intensity aerobics or jumping. 4. excessive weight during resistance exercise. the american college of sports medicine recommends the following exercises for bone health for different age groups: for children and teens: type: impact activities such as gymnastics jumping (sometimes called plyometric training) and moderate-intensity resistance training; participation in sports that involve running and jumping like soccer and basketball (although they concede that research to prove this is lacking). intensity: high in terms of bone-loading forces; for safety reasons resistance training should be moderate equivalent to 60% of the maximum lift. frequency: at least three days per week. duration: 10-20 minutes (two times per day or more may be more effective). for adults: type: weight-bearing endurance activities (tennis; stair climbing; jogging at least intermittently during walking) activities that involve jumping (volleyball basketball) and resistance exercise (weight lifting).,"['osteoporosis', 'exercise']",wmd

what is the role of physical activity and exercise in obesity?,"the national health and examination survey (nhanes i) showed that people who engage in limited recreational activity were more likely to gain weight than more active people. other studies have shown that people who engage in regular strenuous activity gain less weight than sedentary people. physical activity and exercise help burn calories. the amount of calories burned depends on the type duration and intensity of the activity. it also depends on the weight of the person. a 200-pound person will burn more calories running 1 mile than a 120-pound person because the work of carrying those extra 80 pounds must be factored in. but exercise as a treatment for obesity is most effective when combined with a diet and weight-loss program. exercise alone without dietary changes will have a limited effect on weight because one has to exercise a lot to simply lose one pound. however regular exercise is an important part of a healthy lifestyle to maintain a healthy weight for the long term. another advantage of regular exercise as part of a weight-loss program is a greater loss of body fat versus lean muscle compared to those who diet alone. other benefits of exercise include: improved blood sugar control and increased insulin sensitivity (decreased insulin resistance) reduced triglyceride levels and increased ""good"" hdl cholesterol levels lowered blood pressure a reduction in abdominal fat reduced risk of heart disease. remember these health benefits can occur independently (with or without) achieving weight loss. before starting an exercise program you should talk to your doctor about the type and intensity of the exercise program. general exercise recommendations: 20-30 minutes of moderate exercise 5 to 7 days a week preferably daily. types of exercise include walking stationary bicycling walking or jogging on a treadmill stair climbing machines jogging and swimming. exercise can be broken up into smaller 10-minute sessions. start slowly and progress gradually to avoid injury excessive soreness or fatigue. over time build up to 30 to 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise every day. people are never too old to start exercising. even frail elderly individuals (ages 70-90 years) can improve their strength and balance. exercise precautions: the following people should consult a doctor before vigorous exercise: men over age 40 or women over age 50. individuals with heart or lung disease asthma arthritis or osteoporosis. individuals who experience chest pressure or pain with exertion or who develop fatigue or shortness of breath easily. individuals with conditions or lifestyle factors that increase their risk of developing coronary heart disease such as high blood pressure diabetes cigarette smoking high blood cholesterol or having family members with early onset heart attacks and coronary heart disease. a patient who is obese","['obesity', 'exercise']",wmd

i have heavy bleeding and spotting at times. is there a possibility that i might have ectopic pregnancy?,if pregnancy is the concern then the best way to find out is to get a blood serum beta hcg test done. this is a confirmatory test for pregnancy as the urine pregnancy kits may show false positive results. if the levels of hcg are more than 1 or raised then pregnancy is confirmed. if the level is less than 1 then pregnancy is completely ruled out. if the test is positive then you should undergo an ultrasound pelvis to locate the pregnancy for its site which could be intrauterine or possibly in the tubes (ectopic). if the usg shows extrauterine pregnancy then you would require a laparoscopic salpingectomy to remove the damaged tube along with the ectopic. if the pregnancy is intrauterine then you may decide upon continuing the pregnancy. if the test is negative then the possible cause remains uti (urinary tract infection) or a possible pid (pelvic inflammatory disease) or endometriosis. also stress per se can cause derangement of hormonal balance and can cause heavy bleeding inspite of being on continuous progesterone pills. this can be controlled with antifibrinolytics in the absence of pregnancy. for further follow up consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online  ,['heavy bleeding'],ic

i have been constantly hungry and hot lately. even if the air conditioner is on high and i ate 20 minutes earlier why? . this just started a couple of days ago and i am not sure what could be wrong.,if your symptoms persist it would be best for you to see your doctor for a full medical evaluation. your doctor may consider doing a physical exam and lab work. an increase in appetite sometimes occurs with certain conditions such as an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) diabetes and anxiety. feeling hot when other people are not can occur with hyperthyroidism fever and several other conditions. women who are going through menopause often experience hot flashes. take care,['hunger'],wmd
what other medical conditions cause high blood pressure? . i am 66 years old female and do not take any medications. i am not overweight. i workout 1 hour 3 days a week. i do not have a family history of high blood presure. i do not smoke or drink. i eat healthy meals and do not overuse salt. i am not under stress. up until this year my bp was 100/60 now it ranges from 100/60 to 140/90. what other medical conditions can cause bp problems?,"well it certainly sounds like you're doing all the right things to avoid high blood pressure. i salute you! and i want to add: keep doing all those things. our blood pressure tends to fluctuate a little during the day. this is normal. so if you're taking your bp at home and discovering these fluctuations you may not have hypertension at all. granted 140/90 is considered the ""hypertension threshold "" but it's usually concerning only if your pressure is sustained at that level or higher all the time. if for example your blood pressure measures 140/90 immediately after you've been exercising that would be considered a pretty normal finding. everyone's blood pressure rises during exercise  that's part of the point of exercising to get your heart pumping. to your question however many conditions can cause hypertension. kidney problems definitely rank high on the list. adrenal gland tumors also can be the culprit. but i caution you not to jump to any conclusions. the truth is even seemingly healthy people like yourself can develop high blood pressure and we don't know exactly why. this is called ""essential hypertension. "" although it's more common in people with a family history of high blood pressure anyone can wind up with it. if you're concerned about your blood pressure your best bet is to see your medical provider. he or she is in the best position to assess your condition and determine if you have hypertension or not and if so whether or not it needs to be treated. meanwhile keep up the great work! you're an inspiration to the rest of us.","['corpulence', 'salt', 'meal', 'workout', 'healthy eating']",wmd

can anemia be linked to diabetes?,anemia (reduced red blood cell number and/or volume) is more common in patients with longstanding diabetes. this is probably due to the effect of diabetes on the kidney which makes the hormone erythropoietin. erythropoietin stimulates the bone marrow to make red blood cells but this hormone is reduced in patients with moderate or severe diabetic kidney damage resulting in under-stimulated red blood cell production by the marrow. most people with diabetes do not have anemia in the absence of kidney disease. it is easy to test for anemia and kidney disease with simple blood tests that most people with diabetes have had many times. there are many potential causes of anemia including iron deficiency b12 or folic acid deficiency heavy menstrual bleeding ulcer in the stomach or upper intestine colon cancer kidney disease etc. diabetes itself is not really a primary cause.,"['anemia', 'diabetes']",wmd

how much specialty training should physicians have?,a recent editorial in one of the major medical journals discussed the implications of additional post-residency fellowship training. fellowships are the medical professions finishing schools.  typically they go for one or two years after completion of a standard residency which itself can be up to seven years after medical school. therefore it is a significant investment by a young physician who already has spent much of his or her youth in training and education. fellowships are very important because as the world of medical practice — in all specialties — becomes more and more complex particularly because of new technology and science it is impossible to master all areas of the core specialty. that important editorial was written by a prominent educator in the specialty of head and neck surgery my core specialty. he noted that of the 265 trainees finishing residencies in head and neck surgery in approved american residencies 39 percent were pursuing additional fellowship training. that is an impressive percentage. the doctor felt that there were several reasons for that quest for more knowledge and experience. first and most laudable the desire for excellence. next the reality that many young doctors are now reluctant to go into private practice because of the expense the hassles of eternally battling insurance companies and more unproductive government regulation and meddling. tied to that they are going to be drawn to working at universities and other mega-sized multi-specialty medical centers. particularly with those seeking an academic affiliation a fellowship represents a great entry onto ones resume. however the most important thing is whether or not fellowship training for some percentage of surgeons is good for patients. my stance is that it is very important. the best surgeons within narrow niches of given specialties have generally had fellowship training. here is an example from another specialty. orthopedic surgery has so many divisions that it has long operated fellowship programs. after all there are orthopedic surgeons who sub-specialize in spine surgery hand surgery pediatric orthopedics and sports medicine. now there are orthopedic surgeons who do only joint replacements. a subset of that group are the superspecialists in artificial hip placement or artificial knee replacement. this is good for patients because it brings to them the most narrowly focused finely tuned specialty talent. whether you are considering having shoulder replacement or a hernia repair or cosmetic nasal plastic surgery you are generally in the best hands when those hands have been trained by a fellowship.,[],wmd

what are some common bottle-feeding problems and mistakes?,i think sometimes parents jump to the conclusion that a babys gas or fussiness is caused by their baby formula. instead it just may be that baby is at a stage when shes colicky. so instead of changing babys formula all around youd really do better to talk to your pediatrician. thats because intolerance to the baby formula is much less likely than colic for which we have no known cause  or cure. so instead of parents agonizing about the formula they probably just need to wait until baby outgrows the colic which is usually at about three months. another common bottle-feeding problem is the way parents position babies: some lie them completely flat which can make babies choke when feeding on the bottle. so be sure to have your baby semi-inclined or upright. another common mistake is propping the bottle. dont prop babys bottle; it can be a choking hazard. that is also why you should also always be present when baby is feeding even when shes old enough to hold her own bottle. . the main thing: do lots of trial-and-error to be sure you find a bottle and nipple combination that works for your child. so dont stock up on too many of the same kind of bottles unless you know your child is going to take it well. actually the same goes for formula diapers and all baby things: [dont stock up] unless you know your baby is adjusted to that type or brand. also when youre bottle feeding make sure milk is filling up the nipple of babys bottle. otherwise she could swallow a lot of air.,['feeding'],wmd

what are the risks of plyometric exercises?,plyometrics is a very dangerous method of exercising. there are no exceptions and the damage is cumulative. plyometrics involve jumping and landing both involving high acceleration and impact forces. my premise is that all injuries (i. e. tissue damage) are caused by the application of forces that exceed the structural tolerances of the tissues injured. a bone fracture is an obvious example. simply put plyometrics exposes a trainee to injury level forces and this is unnecessary to gain the adaptive benefits of exercise. the problem is not just limited to the spectrum of acute athletic injuries. those high level forces that are not high enough to cause catastrophic tissue failure can still proceed to damage structures like articular cartilage and loosen joint systems (muscle insertions ligaments musculotendinous junctions) in a sub-clinical way. this risk is elevated because of the risk of slipping due to the nature of the exercise. these repeated impact forces contributes to chronic degenerative disease with osteoarthritis as the ultimate result. articular cartilage can be slowly and significantly damaged over time and this has now been shown on runners where sequential mris were done over about 4 years. many people do not know that this asymptomatic damage is irreversible and over time this cumulative damage becomes debilitating.,['exercise'],wmd

friend is pregnant but she doesn't know if it's her friend or her fiance baby. my friend is currently pregnant and she doesn't know if the baby is her friends or fiance and shes upset and she wants to know before the baby is born and is there a way she can find out because her fiance doesn't know please help on what to do and what to tell my friend,the only true method to determine who may be the father is by having a paternity test. but if your friends remembers when she had sexual relations with these two men it is possible to make a pretty accurate determination of paternity within a 10 day period. for example if the baby were to be born on october 18 2014 (case #1) then the probable range of conception would have been january 21 2014- january 29 2014 if the baby was born on october 1 2014 (case #2) then the probable range of conception would be january 4- january - january 12 2014. in case # 1 if sex occurred on january 23rd with man # 2 and on january 12th with man # 1 then man # 2 is the likely father. in case # 2 if sex occurred on january 6th with man # 1 and on january 18th with man # 2 then man # 1 would be the likely father. the doctor who confirmed your friend's pregnancy can provide an expected due date and also provide the probable date range for conception. there are also computer programs available on the internet which can also make the determination. all that is needed is the expected due date and the dates on which sex occurred with the two men.,"['pregnancy', 'baby']",wmd
"anyone here who knows of a pregnancy due to ejaculant on fingers being rubbed on vagina during mutual masturbation? . i've read many many replies (on many websites) from doctors regarding the chances of getting pregnant by a small amount of ejaculant on one's hands being rubbed on the vaginal opening. some say ""yes possible b/c it only takes one sperm"" while some say ""very unlikely b/c sperm need to be inserted higher"". i'd like to know: 1) is there any medical professional here who actually knows of a pregnancy happening from such a situation? 2) are there any more scientific studies on this? thanks",and last sorry could not post all this in one go? can you get pregnant from sperm outside your body? if a man ejaculates around the labia of a womans vagina the tail like whip of the sperm may guide it to the inside of a womans vagina. the mission of each sperm is to reach the unfertilized egg and it has no problem with heading in the right direction if the travel occurs quickly it can get inside where it can live up to two weeks in the womans uterus before inpregnation. no once sperm touches oxygen or air it is killed. think of it as bacteria it dies when its not at body temperature. the two answers above are both false. first of all sperm are very fragile and they are not on a mission to reach a woman's egg. truth be told experiment after experiment has shown that sperm have no sense of direction and can't swim very well. thus the reason that millions of sperm must be present and ejaculated inside a woman so that maybe a handful can reach an egg (if present). also sperm don't die when they hit the air they only die once the semen dies. if you don't know semen is the liquid you can see that contains the sperm which you can't see. if the semen is dry the sperm are dead. think about this even under perfect conditions where both people are fertile and healthy the woman is perfectly ovulating and the man ejaculates directly into her vagina the chances of pregnancy are never more than 80%. so if under perfect conditions it is still relatively difficult to get pregnant than it is nearly impossible to get pregnant in any other fashion. put it this way there has never been a case other than the birth of jesus son of mary where a virgin gets pregnant. so in the real world a man can't just ejaculate on a woman and get her pregnant the two must have sex. it is impossible to keep your virginity and get pregnant because sperm must be inside a woman for her to get pregnant and this can't happen if there is no intercourse. if a man ejaculates on a woman's stomach face breasts etc. there is no chance of pregnancy because the sperm can't just waltz into a woman's vagina. many women may say that they didn't have sex and yet got pregnant but this is not the case. knowledge is power. so there you are there all from different sites some doctors and some not but you do have to remember that sperm when ejaculated inside the vagina is there at your cervix now just add all the way it has to travel through thick mucus and then it has to break into the cervix its a long way to go i know its there job and add into that its only a small amount of sperm it would not be the full load? so lots to have read and think about. but why not give it a try or trial to see if can be done? but please let us know how you got on. do hope this helps you. good luck,"['pregnancy', 'finger', 'vagina', 'masturbation', 'hand']",wmd

what is cystic fibrosis?,"cystic fibrosis (sis-tik fi-bro-sis) or cf is an inherited disease of your secretory glands including the glands that make mucus and sweat. ""inherited"" means that the disease is passed through the genes from parents to children. people who have cystic fibrosis inherit two faulty cystic fibrosis genes — one from each parent. the parents likely don't have the disease themselves. cystic fibrosis mostly affects the lungs pancreas liver intestines sinuses and sex organs. mucus is a substance made by the lining of some body tissues. normally mucus is a slippery watery substance. it keeps the linings of certain organs moist and prevents them from drying out or getting infected. however if you have cystic fibrosis your mucus becomes thick and sticky. the mucus builds up in your lungs and blocks your airways — the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. the build-up of mucus makes it easy for bacteria to grow. this leads to repeated serious lung infections. over time these infections can severely damage your lungs. the thick sticky mucus also can block tubes or ducts in your pancreas. as a result the digestive enzymes that your pancreas makes can't reach your small intestine. these enzymes help break down the food that you eat. without them your intestines can't fully absorb fats and proteins. this can cause vitamin deficiency and malnutrition because nutrients leave your body unused. it also can cause bulky stools intestinal gas a swollen belly from severe constipation and pain or discomfort. cystic fibrosis also causes your sweat to become very salty. as a result your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. this can upset the balance of minerals in your blood and cause a number of health problems. examples include dehydration (a condition in which your body doesn't have enough fluids) increased heart rate tiredness weakness decreased blood pressure heat stroke and rarely death. if you or your child has cystic fibrosis you're also at increased risk for diabetes or a bone-thinning condition called osteoporosis. cystic fibrosis also causes infertility in men and it can make it harder for women to get pregnant.",['cystic fibrosis'],wmd

can a round object travel up from your rectum into your colon and get stuck?,"it's an interesting question. if an object of any size or shape gets inserted into the rectum it can get stuck (or as we like to say in medicine ""retained"") due to the strength of the external anal sphincter. this is the powerful muscle that enables us to hold in or release stool. when an object slips beyond the anal sphincter it can be very hard to get out. you might be surprised how many people go to the emergency room each year to have a foreign object removed from the rectum. however it's unlikely an object would travel up the bowel and deeper into the colon. in the first place peristalsis (a rhythmic contraction of muscles along the digestive tract) naturally propels the contents of the intestines toward the anus. for a foreign object to move against the effects of peristalsis would be akin to a salmon swimming upstream. that's not to say it absolutely couldn't happen i guess. never say never? wishing you well!","['travel', 'rectum', 'colon']",wmd

what causes athletes foot?,athlete's foot (tinea pedis) is a fungal infection of the skin of the foot. most athlete's foot is caused by one of two types of fungus. trichophyton mentagrophytes often causes toe web or vesicular (blisterlike) infections. the infection appears suddenly is severe and is easily treated. trichophyton rubrum often causes moccasin-type infections. this condition lasts for a long time (chronic) and is difficult to treat. you get athletes foot when you come in contact with the fungus and it begins to grow on your skin. fungi commonly grow on or in the top layer of human skin and may or may not cause infections. fungi grow best in warm moist areas such as the area between the toes. athlete's foot is easily spread (contagious)-you can get it by touching the affected area of a person who has it. more commonly you pick up the fungi from damp contaminated surfaces such as the floors in public showers or locker rooms. although athlete's foot is contagious some people are more likely to get it ( susceptible ) than others. susceptibility may increase with age. experts don't know why some people are more likely to get it. after you have had athlete's foot you are more likely to get it again. if you come in contact with the fungi that cause athlete's foot you can spread the fungi to others whether you get the infection or not. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,"[""athlete's foot""]",wmd

are there ways to prevent earaches from colds or ear infections?,there are ways to prevent earaches from colds or ear infections in children and adults. often altering the home environment is all that's needed but sometimes surgery is necessary too. you should talk about the following precautions with your doctor. protect your child from colds especially the first year of life. most ear infections start with colds. ear infections can occur after the flu so ask your doctor about an annual flu shot. most kids receive the pneumococcal vaccine which helps prevent infections with streptococcus pneumoniae which used to be one of the main causes of ear infections. ask your doctor if you're not sure your child has received this vaccine which is usually given before age 2. avoid contact with second-hand tobacco smoke which increases the frequency and severity of ear infections. control allergies. inflammation caused by allergies is a contributing factor to ear infection. if you can breastfeed your baby during the first six to 12 months of life. antibodies in breast milk reduce the rate of ear infections. if you bottle-feed avoid bottle propping holding your baby at a 45-degree angle. feeding in the horizontal position can cause formula and other fluids to flow back into the eustachian tubes. allowing an infant to hold his or her own bottle also can cause milk to drain into the middle ear. weaning your baby from a bottle between nine and 12 months of age will help stop this problem. watch for mouth breathing or snoring which may be caused by large adenoids. these may contribute to ear infections. an exam by an otolaryngologist and even surgery to remove the adenoids (adenoidectomy) may be necessary.,"['cold', 'ears', 'coldness', 'infection']",wmd

what causes crohns disease?,the cause of crohn's disease is unknown. studies suggest that this and other inflammatory bowel diseases may result from an abnormal response by the body's immune system to normal intestinal bacteria. 1 disease-causing bacteria and viruses also may play a role in causing the condition. crohn's disease can run in families so some people may be more likely than others to develop the condition when exposed to something that triggers an immune reaction. environmental factors may also play a role in causing the disease. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,"[""crohn's disease""]",wmd

why does my friend have numbness after hemilaminectomy surgery?,it sounds like your friend is bothered by the persistent tingling and numbness in his left foot. i understand these sensations can be quite irritating especially if your work involves standing for long periods. did he have these tingling sensations in the same areas before the surgery? if so have these worsened after the surgery or remained the same? i assume his symptoms before the surgery were also on the left side and his hemilaminectomy was also performed on the left side. it will be nice if i could see the preoperative mri images to see what the hemilaminectomy was done for. often if the surgery involves removal of a large herniated disc or the space available for the nerve is very less (stenosis) then the nerve may get bruised during surgery due to retraction. this means that in order to decompress the nerve the surgeon has to retract the nerve to go around the nerve and remove the compressing elements. if the compression is severe the nerve gets bruised easily and there may be persistent numbness and tingling in the areas of the leg and foot that are geographically supplied by that nerve. since the surgeon has advised him to wait it out i assume this is likely the case. swelling of the foot is common if the nerve supplying that area is not fully functional. the weak muscles in the leg and foot are not able to push the blood back up towards the heart and gravity causes this dependent area to swell up. this is often seen at the end of the day and gets better at night when he sleeps. it is difficult to predict how long the tingling will last. it could be a few months. the fact that there is tingling and not pure numbness is actually encouraging although it is more irritating to the patient. if it were a complete nerve injury then only numbness would be experienced. the presence of tingling means that the nerve is just irritated inflamed and swollen due to the bruising. if the tingling is very bothersome he may try some neuralgic pain medications like gabapentin or pregabalin. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (nsaids) may also help in this situation. there is a very rare possibility of other complications like recurrent disc herniation other post-surgical changes irritating the nerve etc. these are difficult to diagnose and usually need a new mri with contrast. however it is advisable to delay such investigation for at least for two to three months after surgery since the mri images at this stage will be obscured by the post surgical changes. if the symptoms of tingling and numbness are progressively worsening and if he develops back pain a new mri may be needed irrespective of the time since surgery to rule out infection or instability. the probable causes:surgical retraction of nerve that may have caused it to bruise. investigations to be done:none if symptoms are not progressively worsening. differential diagnosis:recurrent disc herniation. treatment plan:gabapentin or pregabalin and nsaids. regarding follow up:for further doubts consult a spine surgeon online. - ,['tingling sensation'],ic

what if acetaminophen and ibuprofen doesn't bring down my fever? . i have a possible autoimmune disorder that has not been diagnosed as of yet. i frequently get fevers that range between 99 and 101 degrees along with chills and body aches. but as of today both tylenol and motrin did not bring my temperature down until after 3 doses.,there are many many reasons to have a mild temperature elevation. as a matter of fact dependind on the time of day that you took the temperature a temp of 100 could be considered a variation of normal. the normal body temperture hovers around 99 and tends to be a bit higher in the evening; lower in the mornings. fever is usually the body's normal response to fighting of an infection (viruses like colds) or respond to inflammation. while autoimmune disorders can be on this extensive list of reasons for a mild fever it would not be high on the list. you would need to see your medical provider for a thorough medical history some diagnostic tests and a careful examination to determine if an autoimmune disorder was the underlying reason. it is not really necessary to treat a fever especially a mild one with ibuprofen or acetaminophen. remember this is a normal response and fever helps with our immune response. unless you are particularly uncomfortable a fever can be just left alone,"['ibuprofen', 'acetaminophen', 'fever', 'temperature', 'autoimmune disorder']",wmd

what steps are involved in preparing a tooth for a crown?,"preparing a tooth for a crown usually requires two visits to the dentist  the first step involves examining and preparing the tooth the second visit involves placement of the permanent crown. first visit: examining and preparing the tooth. at the first visit in preparation for a crown your dentist may take a few x-rays to check the roots of the tooth receiving the crown and surrounding bone. if the tooth has extensive decay or if there is a risk of infection or injury to the tooth's pulp a root canal treatment may first be performed. before the process of making your crown is begun your dentist will anesthetize (numb) your tooth and the gum tissue around the tooth. next the tooth receiving the crown is filed down along the chewing surface and sides to make room for the crown. the amount removed depends on the type of crown used (for instance all-metal crowns are thinner requiring less tooth structure removal than all-porcelain or porcelain-fused-to-metal ones). if on the other hand a large area of the tooth is missing (due to decay or damage) your dentist will use filling material to ""build up"" the tooth to support the crown. after reshaping the tooth your dentist will use impression paste or putty to make an impression of the tooth to receive the crown. impressions of the teeth above and below the tooth to receive the dental crown will also be made to make sure that the crown will not affect your bite. the impressions are sent to a dental laboratory where the crown will be manufactured. the crown is usually returned to your dentist's office in 2 to 3 weeks. if your crown is made of porcelain your dentist will also select the shade that most closely matches the color of the neighboring teeth. during this first office visit your dentist will make a temporary crown to cover and protect the prepared tooth while the crown is being made. temporary crowns usually are made of acrylic and are held in place using a temporary cement. second visit: receiving the permanent dental crown. at your second visit your dentist will remove your temporary crown and check the fit and color of the permanent crown. if everything is acceptable a local anesthetic will be used to numb the tooth and the new crown is permanently cemented in place.",['tooth'],wmd
how you make squash soup?,last week i started in on soup. the weather is distinctly fall and even feeling wintry in some parts of the country. it is definitely soup weather. we ran out of my nonis minestrone on saturday afternoon this weekend at my restaurant (the amount we made would have usually lasted through monday! ). since our minestrone takes all day to make i needed to come up with a quick soup to fill in for the cold and rainy saturday crowd. i deferred to my favorite butternut squash soup. i have been on a bit of a band wagon for the winter squashes. it is squash season and i think they are versatile and delicious so bear with me. butternut squash soup can be so creamy and delicious with no cream added. i start by putting 1-3 whole squashes in the oven and roasting at 400 with skins on until they are soft enough to easily cut with a sharp knife (about 5-10 minutes). from there i cut them in half lengthwise and remove the seeds. do not throw these little crunchy nuggets of goodness away! you can clean the seeds sprinkle with salt and roast them to make a great topping for the soup. next decide which direction flavor-wise you want to go. indian? sprinkle the squash liberally with your favorite curry powder before you roast. if you want an herb flavor use fresh thyme or sage and garlic cloves. now that you have added your favorite herbs and spices roast the cleaned out squash until they are very tender and starting to get a bit golden. when they reach this point remove from the oven scoop the flesh out of the skins and place it in a blender. you can add chicken or vegetable stock and blend until smooth. i also like to sauté onion or shallot in a bit of olive oil until soft and add it to the squash in the blender. from here you can top with the toasted seeds and a bit of plain yogurt (add lemon zest a pinch of salt and a squeeze of juice to create a crème fraiche-like topping for the soup). serve this warm and satisfying soup with a side salad and toasted multigrain bread for a comforting and healthy dinner.,"['soup', 'squash']",wmd

i have a itchy rash that comes and goes what could be causing this? . the rash appears in different areas of my body for an example a rash showed up on my wrist and stayed a while and went away. later the same day it appeared on my stomach and then on my thighs etc. its itchy while it is present. at one point my hands first turned red and then start to itch really bad to the point i had to wash my hands repeatedly. i work in the medical field so i wash my hands a million times a day. what could be causing this reaction?,this sounds just exactly like an issue that i dealt with for months in 2014. hubby and i went on vacation and on the last couple of days i was having an itch right at my waist line in the back. it wasn't too bad and i didn't think too much of it at the time. it would come and go. the day we got home it got worse. i looked in the mirror and there was a couple of spots each about the size of a quarter that looked like hives. i put an ice pack on it to relieve the itching and after half an hour or so it went away. over the course of about 2 months my nutritionist and i tried and tried to figure it out but it would just come and go several times a day. sometimes on my arms other times it was on my stomach or legs or back. very random. at times it would be circular in shape. other times it would show up as long lines or irregular shapes. definitely looked like hives though. then suddenly it just stopped. i realized one day that it had been a week and no new out breaks. it started on our vacation in august 2014 and ended sometime around november/december 2014. then just this past week it happened again. i noticed my arm pits itching a little one evening but again didn't think much of it. wasn't too bad just a little annoyance a couple times. the next morning i woke up to bright red pits and the same hive looking spots on my stomach. i started thinking about what was different during the time that i didn't have the hives. the only thing i could come up with was the while on our vacation last year we had lots of specialty coffee drinks from a famous coffee shop that i won't name here. i continued to have them several times a week until sometime in the fall don't remember when. just last weekend we decided to have them again a couple times that weekend. large ones. two days later the hives were back. that makes me sad but i guess maybe i need to lay off the expensive coffee drinks and just have my coffee here at home. it can be different things for different people but thought i would mention this just in case it might help someone else. i never thought at the time that my coffee drinks could be the problem (and it may just be a coincidence) but for now i think i'll avoid them.,"['hand', 'thigh', 'wrist', 'rash', 'reaction']",wmd

what's the difference between a salicylic acid peel a glycolic acid peel lactic acid peel and a tca peel? . does a dermatologist have to do this or can an esthetician do these kinds of peels?,when we talk about acid peels what these are doing is that they are creating a controlled chemical burn of the skin. these should be done by trained and qualified physicians. ideally dermatologists or plastic surgeons. what they can do depending on the concentration is cause an exfoliation of the skin that will reveal healthy newer skin behind it. glycolic acids come in different strength. they can be as low as a 5% up to a 70% and depending on whether or not it's buffered so how neutral it is what the ph of it is can affect how powerful that treatment is. that needs to be neutralized in order to turn it off. so the longer you leave it on the skin the longer the results last. salicylic acid is often called a beta lift or a beta peel and this does not need to be neutralized. so we have different concentrations it can be 20-30% and you have to be careful because this is absorbed into the body so we have to limit the body surface area that we apply. we wouldn't do the face and the back in one treatment because too much of the product would be absorbed and can cause systemic problems or problems internally. so it does need to be done in a very careful and monitored way. but it does turn off by itself. afterwards you get red and you peel. i like the beta or the salicylic acid peels for people who are more acne-prone and the glycolic acids for general skin rejuvenation. the lactic acid peels are more gentle in the alpha hydroxy or glycolic acid family of peels. they tend to be better for more sensitive and more dry skin. trichloric acetic acid peels tend to be very strong. you have to be especially careful with these. in as low as 10% concentration that tends to be very gentle but unlike the other peels every time you apply it you are getting a stronger concentration. so if you take a 10% peel and you keep dabbing it over the spot you can get up to a 30-40% concentration. so there is a lot of finesse that go around these products. it is also self-neutralizing which is good because it turns itself off but also we don't have a neutralizer for it. so if you have too strong a product on your skin that can create a chemical burn that can be significant. so these are treatments that should be done under the supervision or directly by your physician. you need to be evaluated to make sure that your skin is healthy enough for this treatment and you need to know what to expect afterwards; what the downtime is what the skincare is in order to get the best results out of them.,[],wmd

what vitamins could you take for low estrogen?,although supplement companies will claim their vitamins will help balance hormones the evidence regarding this is lacking. first off a lot depends on why your estrogen is low. if it is because of peri-menopause or menopause you want to be sure you are getting enough calcium (through diet is recommended over supplements) and vitamin d for bone health which can decrease with lower levels of estrogen. look at your diet. try to eat healthier by including plenty of fruits vegetables whole grains low fat dairy healthy fats and lean protein (including fish twice a week). if there are gaps in your diet then consider supplementing. for example if you don't eat fish you may want to consider omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil). vitamin d is tough to get through food so supplementation is usually needed. if you are concerned about it see a registered dietitian who can help you sort through the proper diet and supplementation. you can find one in your area at eatright. org. also see: the 7 missing nutrients in your diet,"['estrogen', 'vitamin']",wmd

what can i do about head lice?,head lice have not killed anyone but they are public enemy number one in the school system. just the mention of head lice will make you scratch (i bet you are thinking about scratching your head right now). head lice are just trying to survive so they find a nice person to adopt so they can feed on their blood. yes head lice are vampires — they drink tiny amounts of human blood but fortunately they do not carry diseases. lice mature quickly and are quite prolific in the sex department. lice lay dozens of eggs (nits); eggs that quickly hatch in order to perpetuate their species. as you read this blog lice may be drinking blood and having sex on your scalp right now! now you can scratch your head. it is this hysteria about head lice that drive parents and teachers crazy. school systems have adopted questionable no-nit policies banning kids from walking through the doors if any suspicious white specks are spotted on their scalp. schools must have a team of nit nazis. insects are taking over our world. actually insects outnumber us astronomically so really we are guests in their world. dogs get fleas so we spend millions on ways to eradicate them. termites are eating our homes. flies are landing on our dinner plate. ants and cockroaches show up at night to wander our kitchen looking for morsels and crumbs. bedbugs are now permanent residents in many fine hotels. kids — even the cleanest kids from the cleanest homes — can get head lice. i know. my long-haired daughter brought some home many years ago. girls are much more social and get head lice more often than boys. i often see sesame-seed sized nits on my little patients. it is rare that i see a live louse scurrying around but i have seen those as well. i do tend to take a little perverted pleasure in informing a well-coiffed snooty mother that her little angel is crawling with bugs. your daughter has head lice.  what! are you sure? could it be something else?  no. she seems to be harboring a vibrant colony of california scalp-crickets also known as the common cootie. you probably have them too.  like most of the species on earth head lice have adapted to treatments which range from insecticides like permithrin products (like nix) malathion and sulfa antibiotics to the newly-tested stromectal — a pill containing ivermectin a drug used to prevent heartworms in dogs. people do prefer pills to messy hair products but a heartworm medicine seems like an overkill. petroleum jelly mayonnaise and olive oil are sometimes used in an attempt to suffocate head lice but these treatments have not been proven to be effective. too bad since a kid with a scalp full of mayonnaise or vaseline is so attractive. there is a lice-smothering product called ulesfia that does seem to work well as long as the peta people dont know you are killing innocent lice. my late grandmother mother of 15 and self-taught research pharmacologist used kerosene. once you kill off the live lice and their egg offspring the next job is to manually remove the nits. there are all sorts of finetooth nit combs out there and a few substances that claim to dissolve the epoxy-like glue that attaches lice eggs to the hair shaft but in the end adults end up just picking them out one at a time. there may be an evolving market for trained baboons to pick out the eggs and eat them. lice do not respect social status so anyone can get them. if your kids bring them home from school then you will need to go to def con 4. the recommendation is to clean everything that can logically be cleaned; however lice do not exist very long off of the human scalp. vacuum the carpets and mattresses but again lice do not fly and travel too far from the home scalp. it is not necessary to burn down the house and move.,['head lice'],wmd
what happens if your blood sugar level falls to 40?,well it's certainly not a situation anyone wants to be in. extremely low blood sugar levels can lead to coma  which isn't a good outcome. the quickest remedy for a very low blood sugar level is. sugar. in the hospital we administer dextrose via iv line. assuming you're awake and alert and realize your blood sugar has dipped you can eat a sugary treat such as a small candy bar to bring your sugar level back up. note: no one should attempt to feed sugar to an unconscious or unresponsive person even if you know low blood sugar is the cause. you should call 9-1-1 or your local emergency number instead. of course it's not a good idea to ever let your blood sugar level get too low. one goal of diabetes management is to maintain blood sugar within a therapeutic range. for adults that might be between 70 and 13 milligrams/deciliter (mg/dl). you should try to avoid peaks and valleys in your blood sugar levels. that said if you go around measuring your blood sugar every hour you're going to find you do indeed have some peaks and valleys throughout the day. that's normal. you should measure your blood sugar at the appropriate times and eat a balanced diet that includes several healthy snacks throughout the day to keep your blood sugar as level as possible. if you have any questions about diabetes management ask your doctor or your diabetes nurse educator. they're the experts who can give you all the specific information you need for your personal health situation. wishing you well!,['blood sugar'],wmd

"" i know that my colleagues across the pond have been quite aggressive about finding creative solutions for countering the childhood obesity epidemic in england. their academy of pediatrics has recently proposed a ban on junk food and beverage tv ads aimed at kids a stiff tax on sugary items and a requirement that fast food restaurants be located far away from schools. but this bmj analysis takes the discussion to a different and understandably more contentious place. should parents be blamed for their childs obesity? intrigued i did some homework to share with you. the childhood obesity-child protection issue has emerged over the past several years garnering increased media and professional attention. at the 2007 british medical associations annual meeting members rejected a motion in which obesity occurring in kids under 12 constituted a reason to charge parents with neglect and removal of the child into protective custody. this action followed on the heels of a bbc survey of 50 pediatricians who noted that childhood obesity had been a factor in at least 20 child protection cases in 2006. the uk is not alone in its concerns which are evident internationally including us courts which have already been removing some obese children from parents considered neglectful. heres an example from missouri where an boy was removed from his foster home because his foster father was obese. the bmj authors examined the existing literature on childhood obesity and protective actions and suggested a blueprint for action. what they found is that there is indeed evidence of an association between obesity and sexual abuse violence and neglect. however there is no data on the relationship between child protection actions and weight control in the long term. moreover theres no information about the long-term physical and mental welfare of an obese child who undergoes removal from the home and placement into foster care. the bmj authors note that obesity is part of a larger constellation of child welfare concerns related to child protection. this means that all aspects of the childs family and living environment including nutrition and activity need to be closely assessed when determining whats best for the childs welfare. to further complicate things there is good research that shows even when obese children have strong family support or ready access to credible weight-loss programs kids can still struggle to remove the pounds. they suggest that failure to comply with obesity treatment (missing appointments not supporting obese children with weight management programs or even actively sabotaging their kids' efforts) is tantamount to neglect especially in those kids who are already suffering medical consequences arising from their obesity. in reviewing the media coverage on this topic its clear that the brits are more open to aggressive legal actions especially for children under 12. they see it as an issue of extreme overfeeding which they believe constitutes abuse. they argue that malnutrition and starvation of a child results in immediate court interventions so why not obesity? but the royal college of paediatrics and child health has continued to argue that obesity is a public health problem not a child protection issue. the bottom line is that this is a very complex and controversial issue. the real goal is to protect children from serious harm. most pediatricians have gone on record noting that the majority of parents do care about their children but may not be knowledgeable about how to do it. that means that every parent must be a role model for their children by walking the talk and creating a healthy living environment for the whole family. doctors and all medical care providers are also role models and mentors who need to provide counseling education and programs for parents to help obese children and their families.",['childhood obesity'],wmd

had sex on fertile days when should i check if pregnant?,current home pregnancy tests (hpts) are advertised to be sensitive on the first day of a missed period—or perhaps a few days before. in the most recent review of accuracy of hpts published in august of 2011 such claims were tested. one brand first response® detected 97% of pregnancies on the first day of a missed period. the ept® manual (54%) and digital (67%); and the clear blue® manual (64%) and digital (54%) tests all detected fewer actual pregnancies. these results may reflect that the first response® could detect as little as 5. 5 miu/ml of hcg in the urine while the other two brands could detect 22 miu/ml. generally speaking a reliable pregnancy test in a doctors office should be able to detect a level of 22 units of hcg or higher. remember it takes an implantation to produce hcg to trigger a test. in a study where day of implantation was documented with a sensitive blood test it was determined that 10% of viable pregnancies were not yet implanted by the first day of the missed period! having read all this you can now understand why a gyn may recommend using a hpt twice if the first instance is at the time of missed flow. about 97% of viable pregnancies will have implanted by seven days after the first day of missed menses. taking a second reading can also enhance accuracy where your hpt is not one of the super-sensitive brands.,"['sexual intercourse', 'pregnancy', 'fertility']",wmd

what is epilepsy?,an epileptic seizure is a sudden and transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms that are the result of abnormal activity in the brain. epileptic seizures are the common and defining component of the disorder that is referred to as epilepsy. the diagnosis of epilepsy implies that there is an abnormality in the brain and that this abnormality will result in more epileptic seizures. that is an individual who has an isolated seizure as a result of an acute transient insult to the brain for example a metabolic disorder or a seizure observed after an acute trauma to the brain would not be diagnosed as having epilepsy. in other words epilepsy is the tendency to have repeated spontaneous seizures.,['epilepsy'],wmd

why have experts recommended lowering levels of acetaminophen in prescription and over-the-counter drugs?,this is a hot topic right now. i think what a lot of consumers and patients didn't realize is that acetaminophen is also known as tylenol over-the-counter or apap. in prescription medications it's also included. so we had a lot of people taking two medications that contained a lot of tylenol and exceeding what we call the daily dose. if you are a healthy adult. you don't want to exceed more than 4000 milligrams a day. in the elderly we recommend 2000 milligrams a day. we also found out that a lot of people were taking it too many times a day not following the directions on the box. so we really want to make sure that people understand it's important to take it as directed as per the instructions on the box. if you ever have any questions about the dosing come and talk to the pharmacist we will be more than happy to help you with that. we also want to make sure that you don't drink any alcohol while taking these products. and that you also want to avoid alcohol containing products. some cough syrups still contain alcohol and it's usually just enough that with the tylenol in the alcohol it actually causes an elevation in your liver enzymes. we see this a lot sometimes with people who have the flu. they tend to not feel well they are taking a lot of cold medicines on top of tylenol for their fever and there has been some emergency room admissions where peoples liver enzymes were elevated just from a few days of doing this. so that is the reason why it's a hot topic right now.,"['acetaminophen', 'over the counter', 'drug']",wmd

what causes hair loss?,doctors do not know why certain hair follicles are programmed to have a shorter growth period than others. although a person's level of androgens  male hormones normally produced by both men and women  is believed to be a factor hair loss has nothing to do with virility. an individual's genes however  from both male and female parents  unquestionably influence that person's predisposition to male or female pattern baldness. telogen effluvium is temporary hair loss that can occur within a few months after a high fever a severe illness or extreme stress and in women following childbirth. drugs that can cause temporary hair loss include chemotherapy drugs used in cancer treatment blood thinners retinoids used to treat acne and other skin problems beta-adrenergic blockers used to control blood pressure and birth control pills. hair loss can also be caused by burns x-rays and scalp injuries. in such cases normal hair growth usually returns once the cause is eliminated. ringworm caused by a fungal infection can also cause hair loss. the causes of alopecia areata a disease that often strikes children or teenagers remain unexplained. it is thought to be an autoimmune disease meaning that the immune system revs up for unknown reasons and affects the hair follicles. in most cases the hair grows back although it may be very fine and possibly a different color before normal coloration and thickness return. although shampooing too often perms bleaching and dyeing hair do not cause baldness they can contribute to overall thinning by making hair weak and brittle. tight braiding and using rollers or hot curlers can damage and break hair and running hair picks through tight curls can scar hair follicles. in most instances hair grows back normally if the source of the problem is removed but severe damage to the hair or scalp sometimes causes permanent bald patches.,['hair loss'],wmd

how can i help my overweight child lose weight?,when you and your child's doctor have determined that your child needs to lose weight a serious attempt to treat the problem should be undertaken. here are some tips to get you started. set goals. just like with adult weight loss the weight loss goals in children should be attainable allowing for normal growth. the goals should initially be small so that the child doesn't become discouraged or overwhelmed. a five to 10 pound weight loss is a reasonable first goal  about 1 to 4 pounds per month. food diary. work with your child to keep a food diary. this should include not just the type and quantity of food eaten but where it was eaten and who else was present. the diary is not meant to help calculate calories eaten. rather it is useful in determining eating patterns and problem foods. diet. work with your child's doctor to ensure that your child is receiving a balanced diet even if the calories consumed are decreased. consider working with a dietitian also. physical activity. exercise is an essential component for any long-term weight loss. start small to avoid discouraging the child and work up to 20 to 30 minutes of moderate activity per day in addition to what they get in school. behavior modification. it's important to help your child learn the skills to modify the behaviors that may be causing the weight problem. consider sending your child to a nutritional counselor. parental role. help your child by limiting the amount of fattening foods in the house eating all meals at the dinner table at designated times and discouraging second helpings.,"['corpulence', 'weight', 'diet']",wmd

why do i yawn after 30-40 minutes of exercising?,it doesnt seem like anyone really knows exactly why some people yawn during or after exercise but there are some theories. one thought is that you may be trying to get more oxygen. think about what a yawn actually is; a long deep breath of air. this deep breath may serve as a means to get more oxygen into your body which makes sense because exercise can make your body oxygen-deprived. yawning can also increase heart rate and blood pressure helping to increase the cardiac output that your heart might need during exercise. some research suggests that yawning could actually provide a cooling effect as a way to regulate your core body temperature after exercise as well. of course you may just be yawning because youre fatigued or sleep deprived or it could be a side effect of some medications too. there really isnt one single answer as to why we yawn during or after exercise. excessive yawning may be the sign of an underlying health condition however so please consult your doctor for further guidance.,['exercise'],wmd

length of weakness from flu. how long after running no fever will it take till my muscle/joint weakness starts to disappear? when can i resume my normal outdoor activities (cycling) without fear of relapse?,an otherwise healthy person who gets the flu will usually improve over two to five days. in some people that tired feeling may last for one week or more and very rarely the symptoms can last for several weeks (post influenza asthenia). a major concern when you get the flu is that complications can arise. this is not strictly a relapse but the development of another illness. the risk is highest for those with diabetes; heart lung or kidney disease; and other chronic diseases that lower the body's resistance to infection. persons over age 65 are also at greater risk of developing complications from the flu. a very serious complication associated with the flu is pneumonia. shortness of breath sharp chest pain on deep breathing or fever lasting beyond five days are symptoms that may indicate pneumonia. talk with your doctor if your symptoms are not improving. it is always better to wait until you are feeling better before starting back on a vigorous exercise program. it is normal to feel weak for several days after the flu but if your symptoms persist seek medical attention to be safe.,"['flu', 'muscle', 'fever', 'fear', 'running']",wmd

how is a sinus infection diagnosed?,sinus infection is most often diagnosed based on a history and examination made by a doctor. because plain x-ray studies of the sinuses may be misleading and procedures such as ct and mri scans which are much more sensitive in their ability to diagnose sinus infection are so expensive and not available in most doctors offices most cases of sinus infection are initially diagnosed and treated based on clinical findings on examination. these physical findings may include: redness and swelling of the nasal passages purulent (pus like) drainage from the nasal passages (the symptom most likely to clinically diagnose a sinus infection) tenderness to percussion (tapping) over the cheeks or forehead region of the sinuses swelling about the eyes and cheeks. occasionally nasal secretions are examined for secreted cells that may help differentiate between infectious and allergic sinusitis. infectious sinusitis may show specialized cells of infection (polymorphonuclear cells) while allergic sinusitis may show specialized cells of allergy (eosinophils). physicians prescribe antibiotics if bacterial infection is suspected. antibiotics are not effective against viral infections; many physicians then treat the symptoms. if sinus infection fails to respond to the initial treatment prescribed then more in-depth studies such as ct or mri scans may be performed. ultrasound has been used to diagnose sinus infections in pregnant women but is not as accurate as ct or mri. rhinoscopy a procedure for directly looking in the back of the nasal passages with a small flexible fiber optic tube may be used to directly look at the sinus openings (ostea) and check for obstruction of these openings by either swelling or growths. it may sometimes be necessary to perform a needle aspiration (needle puncture) of a sinus to get infected material to culture to determine what pathogen is actually causing the sinus infection. cultures of the nasal passages are rarely helpful in determining what bacteria or fungus is causing a sinus infection since the nasal passages are often colonized by non-infecting bacteria. the needle puncture procedure is usually done by an otolaryngologist when treatments have failed to alleviate the disease. the procedure is uncomfortable and requires local anesthesia; some patients require general anesthesia. the sinus is aspirated the contents sent for culture and staining and the sinus may be flushed with a saline solution. this is technically the most accurate way to diagnose infectious sinusitis. in addition both rigid and flexible endoscopy have been used to obtain diagnostic material from sinuses. unfortunately these procedures are also uncomfortable and need to be done by an otolaryngologist who may need to sedate the patient. some investigators suggest that endoscopy specimens are comparable to those obtained by needle puncture.,['sinus infection'],wmd
i have or think i have influenza when should i contact my doctor?,call or other emergency services if: a baby younger than 3 months has a high fever. you are having trouble breathing or feel very short of breath. you have a severe headache or stiff neck and are confused or having trouble staying awake. call your doctor if: you have an extremely high fever. your fever lasts for longer than 3 days. you are finding it harder and harder to breathe. wheezing develops. new pain develops or pain localizes to one area such as an ear the throat the chest or the sinuses. symptoms persist in spite of home treatment. symptoms become more severe or frequent. watchful waiting in most healthy people the flu will go away in 5 to 7 days although fatigue can last much longer. although you may feel very sick home treatment is usually all that is needed. if it is flu season you may just want to treat your symptoms at home. watch closely for symptoms of a bacterial infection such as nasal drainage that changes from clear to colored after 5 to 7 days and symptoms that return or get worse. early treatment (within 48 hours of your first symptoms) with antiviral medicines may reduce the severity of influenza and may prevent serious flu-related complications. 2 babies older adults and people who have chronic health problems are more likely to have complications from the flu and they may need to see a doctor for care beyond home treatment. but not all antiviral medicines work against all strains of the flu. talk to your doctor if you think you may need an antiviral medicine. call your doctor if you think your symptoms are caused by something other than the flu. who to see these doctors can diagnose and treat the flu: family physician internist pediatrician nurse practitioner physician assistant a doctor who specializes in treating infectious diseases may be needed if the diagnosis is not clear or if severe complications develop. to prepare for your appointment see the topic making the most of your appointment. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,['flu'],wmd

does taking famotidine and antibiotics at the same time bad? i take them at the same exact time. i read somewhere to take famotidine 1-2 hrs before or after taking antibiotics i just finished up taking the other antibiotic i was on. anyway im jjst concerned that taking the antibiotics and famotidine at the same time is affecting the potency of the anti iotic helpp,"this is a very good question. to my knowledge there is no serious adverse reaction associated with taking famotidine with an antibiotic. however taking famotidine with an anti-fungal oral medication (such as the ones with names ending in ""azole"") can have serious side effects. taking certain antacid or anti-gerd medications like famotidine can reduce the effectiveness of other medications when taken together. thus it's a good idea to wait 1-2 hours before or after taking other medications before you take a product like famotidine. because you have finished your antibiotics (good for you! ) the real question is: do you still have symptoms of your illness? if not then you did no harm by combining the two medications. if you still feel ill then i'd suggest you go back to your primary care provider explain the situation and get evaluated to see if you need another course of antibiotics. in all likelihood everything worked out fine. at least that's my hope for you!",['antibiotic'],wmd

will i be fined for failing to buy health insurance? i am 53 and make $12 000 a year.,this question was sparked no doubt by the much-talked-about individual mandate which is a central component of the health reform law. with some exceptions this provision would require all u. s. citizens to purchase health insurance or face a penalty beginning in 2014. at 53 with an annual income of $12 000 this reader would likely qualify for medicaid. starting in 2014 states will receive additional funding from the federal government to cover the cost of extending medicaid benefits. if you're an individual making $14 000 per year or a family of four earning $29 000 or less (133 percent of the federal poverty level) you would receive health benefits via medicaid and avoid paying a penalty. helping the middle class pay for insurance for the middle class tax credits will be made available to help pay for health plans purchased through health insurance exchanges that will be set up by 2014. if you're an individual making $43 000 or less or a family of four making less than $88 000 the government will subsidize your insurance premiums. you may also be eligible for reduced co-payments coinsurance and deductibles to assist with the cost of coverage. but if you fail to obtain insurance you will be penalized. here's how it breaks down: starting in 2014 the tax penalty will be $95 and that amount will gradually increase to the greater of $695 per year for individuals $2085 per family or 2. 5 percent of a household's income. there will be exemptions for financial hardship. the individual mandate  a little background the individual mandate was included in the new law as a way of paying for an additional 30 million uninsured americans to have insurance by requiring everyone to pay into the system. this is one the most hotly debated aspects of the new law. a number of lawsuits have been filed around the country questioning whether or not it is constitutional to require americans to purchase a product in this case health insurance. recent rulings in michigan and virginia upheld the new law. however earlier this week a federal judge in richmond va. ruled against it saying that the individual mandate to purchase health insurance violates the constitution. all this is to say that there will be many legal battles between now and 2014 when this mandate is scheduled to take effect. ultimately the decision as to whether it's legal for the government to require people to purchase health insurance will likely fall to the supreme court.,"['insurance', 'health insurance', 'affordable care act', 'medicaid']",wmd

how can i prevent my partner from having an affair?,good communication can prevent affairs by keeping relationships strong. it is especially important that couples share their thoughts and feelings about each other. when couples express their appreciation of each other they highlight all that feels good. by praising your partner for accomplishments or for particular characteristics (e. g. hard working benevolent) they will feel positively about themselves and you. by thanking your partner for doing something nice for you you let them know that you value them. another important part of good communication is talking about conflicts and painful feelings. people who are emotionally close are bound to step on each others toes sometimes. when this happens its important that they talk about it. this helps the offended party by giving them an opportunity to share their experience; and hopefully feel validated and cared about by their partners response. it also helps the offending party know the effect of their action; and provides an opportunity for them to offer a sincere apology sharing their deep feelings of caring. partners can also prevent affairs by proactively staying away from situations that threaten their fidelity. while conducting couple therapy over the years ive seen how both men and women have formed innocent friendships that eventually developed into affairs. so to prevent an affair from developing it is important that people are aware of this possibility and disconnect from (or put distance in) such relationships early on. they would also do well to think about whether there is something missing from their main relationship that leaves them vulnerable to looking elsewhere — and then to work on remedying that situation. unfortunately there is no absolutely sure way to prevent affairs or to ensure that someone you love wont hurt you. but maintaining good communication and proactively protecting your relationship are two very good ways to nurture a happy monogamous relationship.,[],wmd

what is transference and countertransference?,in doing analytical dynamic or freudian therapy these terms are used. transference is how the patient unconsciously acts towards the therapist. i. e. if the patient is always feeling the therapist is harsh condescending vindictive (things we are trained not to be. ) and then the patient starts lashing out verbally skipping appointments then this may be a reflection about how the patient dealt with a harsh condescending vindictive mother or father. this helps the therapist understand the patient's behaviors which they can then work on. countertransference is how the therapist feels and thinks about the patient. we can get angry feel harsh vindictive etc. towards patients but in theory and depending on your training we are taught not to act on these thoughts/feelings but to recognize them and understand how the patient likely makes other people in their usual environment feel. for example if a patient makes me always feel angry and irritated they probably do this to their spouse boss family members etc. too. both are tools we use to help patients in this type of therapy,[],wmd

what is colitis?,colitis means inflammation of the colon. the colon also known as the large intestine or large bowel constitutes the last part of the digestive tract. the colon is a long muscular tube that receives undigested food from the small intestine. it removes water from the undigested food stores it and then eliminates it from the body through bowel movements. the rectum is the last part of the colon adjacent to the anus. the common symptoms of colitis include: abdominal pain. diarrhea. sometimes rectal bleeding. there are many different types of colitis with different causes. some examples of colitis include: infectious colitis caused by bacteria (such as shigella campylobacter e. coli and c. difficile ). infectious colitis caused by a virus (such as cytomegalovirus (cmv)). radiation colitis (such as following treatment with radiation for prostate cancer). ischemic colitis (such as a blockage of an artery in the colon by a blood clot. if the blood clot interrupts the flow of blood to a segment of the colon the result is inflammation of that segment and sometimes even death [gangrene] of the segment). crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (two related conditions that are caused by abnormalities of the body's immune system in which the body is inappropriately making antibodies and chemicals that attack the colon) infectious radiation ischemic ulcerative and crohn's colitis all have visible abnormalities in the inner lining of the colon. these abnormalities include edema (swelling of the lining) redness bleeding of the lining with gentle rubbing (friability) and ulcers. these abnormalities can be seen during either colonoscopy (examination of the entire colon using a long flexible viewing tube) or flexible sigmoidoscopy (examination of the rectum and the sigmoid colon; the segment of the colon closest to the rectum). edema and inflammation of the colon's lining interferes with the absorption of water from the undigested food and the unabsorbed water exits the rectum as diarrhea. pus and fluid also are secreted into the colon and add to the diarrhea. the redness bleeding of the lining with gentle rubbing (friability) and ulcerations in the lining of the colon contribute to rectal bleeding.,['colitis'],wmd

what is prostate cancer?,prostate cancer is a malignant (cancerous) tumor (growth) that consists of cells from the prostate gland. generally the tumor usually grows slowly and remains confined to the gland for many years. during this time the tumor produces little or no symptoms or outward signs (abnormalities on physical examination). however all prostate cancers do not behave similarly. some aggressive types of prostate cancer grow and spread more rapidly than others and can cause a significant shortening of life expectancy in men affected by them. a measure of prostate cancer aggressiveness is the gleason score which is calculated by a trained pathologist observing prostate biopsy specimens under the microscope. as the cancer advances however it can spread beyond the prostate into the surrounding tissues (local spread). moreover the cancer also can metastasize (spread even farther) throughout other areas of the body such as the bones lungs and liver. symptoms and signs therefore are more often associated with advanced prostate cancer.,['prostate cancer'],wmd

is a blood pressure of 153/94 dangerous when i have always had a very normal blood pressure before? . i have had normal blood pressure for years but now i have excessively rapid resting pulse and bp in the 150/95 area. i have had a nuclear stress test that showed normal parameters.,i'm glad to hear you're following up on this and have had a nuclear stress test. it's great news that no heart trouble seems to have turned up on that. so why has your resting blood pressure gone up? well there are a number of possibilities. (note i'm not suggesting any of these may apply to you. i'm just talking about various reasons a person's blood pressure can rise in general. ) for one thing as we age our blood pressure generally starts creeping up. by the time a person reaches age 80 for example it's not uncommon for him or her to have a normal resting blood pressure of 140/90 or even higher. this usually is caused by a natural stiffening of the arteries as we age. that stiffness raises the pressure inside the arteries which results in an elevated blood pressure. another possible cause for elevated resting blood pressure is anxiety. panic attacks can make blood pressure go up and even a high level of general anxiety can increase the resting pulse rate and blood pressure. pain can cause an elevated pulse rate and increased blood pressure. people in chronic pain often exhibit this combination of symptoms. those are by no means the only things that could cause this particular combination of symptoms. i only wanted to highlight some of the obvious ones. i hope your healthcare provider is able to pinpoint the source of your elevated pressure and treat it. wishing you well!,"['blood pressure', 'pulse']",wmd

what is cystic fibrosis?,cystic fibrosis (cf) is a chronic progressive condition that affects the body's respiratory and digestive systems. it is due to a gene defect. people who have cf produce abnormally thick sticky mucus which clogs the lungs and leads to repeated lung and sinus infections as well as difficulty breathing. the thick mucus also obstructs the ducts of the pancreas preventing digestive enzymes from reaching the intestines. because so little food is absorbed children with cf have difficulty gaining and maintaining weight. cf also affects the reproductive systems of both males and females. females with cf may have difficulty getting pregnant. males with cf are almost always sterile because they produce relatively few or no sperm.,['cystic fibrosis'],wmd
what causes acid reflux also known as gerd?,the cause of gerd is complex. there probably are multiple causes and different causes may be operative in different individuals or even in the same individual at different times. a small number of patients with gerd produce abnormally large amounts of acid but this is uncommon and not a contributing factor in the vast majority of patients. the factors that contribute to gerd are the lower esophageal sphincter hiatal hernias esophageal contractions and emptying of the stomach. lower esophageal sphincter the action of the lower esophageal sphincter or les is perhaps the most important factor (mechanism) for preventing reflux. the esophagus is a muscular tube that extends from the lower throat to the stomach. the les is a specialized ring of muscle that surrounds the lower-most end of the esophagus where it joins the stomach. the muscle that makes up the les is active most of the time. this means that it is contracting and closing off the passage from the esophagus into the stomach. this closing of the passage prevents reflux. when food or saliva is swallowed the les relaxes for a few seconds to allow the food or saliva to pass from the esophagus into the stomach and then it closes again. several different abnormalities of the les have been found in patients with gerd. two of them involve the function of the les. the first is abnormally weak contraction of the les which reduces its ability to prevent reflux. the second is abnormal relaxations of the les called transient les relaxations. the most recently described abnormality in patients with gerd is laxity of the les. specifically similar distending pressures open the les more in patients with gerd than in individuals without gerd. hiatal hernia hiatal hernias contribute to reflux although the way in which they contribute is not clear. a majority of patients with gerd have hiatal hernias but many do not. therefore it is not necessary to have a hiatal hernia in order to have gerd. moreover many people have hiatal hernias but do not have gerd. it is not known for certain how or why hiatal hernias develop. esophageal contractions swallows are important in eliminating acid in the esophagus. swallowing causes a ring-like wave of contraction of the esophageal muscles which narrows the lumen (inner cavity) of the esophagus. the contraction referred to as peristalsis begins in the upper esophagus and travels to the lower esophagus. it pushes food saliva and whatever else is in the esophagus into the stomach. when the wave of contraction is defective refluxed acid is not pushed back into the stomach. in patients with gerd several abnormalities of contraction have been described. for example waves of contraction may not begin after each swallow or the waves of contraction may die out before they reach the stomach. also the pressure generated by the contractions may be too weak to push the acid back into the stomach. such abnormalities of contraction which reduce the clearance of acid from the esophagus are found frequently in patients with gerd. in fact they are found most frequently in those patients with the most severe gerd. the effects of abnormal esophageal contractions would be expected to be worse at night when gravity is not helping to return refluxed acid to the stomach. note that smoking also substantially reduces the clearance of acid from the esophagus. this effect continues for at least 6 hours after the last cigarette. emptying of the stomach most reflux during the day occurs after meals. this reflux probably is due to transient les relaxations that are caused by distention of the stomach with food. a minority of patients with gerd about 20% has been found to have stomachs that empty abnormally slowly after a meal. the slower emptying of the stomach prolongs the distention of the stomach with food after meals. therefore the slower emptying prolongs the period of time during which reflux is more likely to occur.,"['heartburn', 'reflux']",wmd

is it possible to be pregnant and feel totally fine? . about a month ago i felt great but my period was late. so i took a pregnancy test which had a positive line albeit a bit fainter than the test line which confused me. turns out i was pregnant (now i know any positive line means positive. ) however unfortunately i lost the pregnancy-i don't know why. could the fact that i wasn't having any pregnancy symptoms be related to the pregnancy loss? could it be that my next pregnancy will be as easy as this one?,hi i found this for you its a lot better than i could write its from this site  very early miscarriage very early miscarriage which is common - guessed at as up to 50% of all miscarriages - is a pregnancy that ends soon after implantation sometimes only a few days later. you may not even have been aware that you were pregnant. this early loss is medically referred to as a chemical pregnancy and it would once have gone undetected with-out the ultra sensitive pregnancy tests now on the market making it easier to get a positive result 3 or 4 days before your period is due. if a home pregnancy kit showed faintly positive it was not a false pregnancy test it was evidence that conception had taken place. the medical term changes to clinical pregnancy when a baby continues to develop normally but miscarries before it would be visible on an ultrasound usually at around 5 or 6 weeks gestation or within about a week of a missed period. when your period does arrive it can be put down to a late one and is usually heavier than normal so i think you had what they call a chemical pregnancy may have even been before you tested thats why it was so faint from what was writen above. hope this helps you. good luck,"['pregnancy', 'period', 'pregnancy test', 'confusion']",wmd

what should i know about going to a medical spa?,recently i have been reviewing the subject of medical spas and in my files i found an interesting article published in plastic surgery practice several years ago. the story was an expose of medical spas with very thin physician coverage. the founder and executive director of the international medical spa association was quoted as saying there are many medical spas operating throughout the united states whose medical director is not necessarily an md.  i do think it is important that a physician and particularly one who is a skin specialist be on site and available at all times. after all the decision to initiate treatment is a medical decision. secondly what if there is a complication? who is more capable of recognizing and treating a complication? now medical spas certainly may have medically trained personnel including estheticians who are typically licensed by the state in which they practice. generally the state board of cosmetology oversees estheticians and the spa environment. however some medical spas take on procedures that are a bit more aggressive than an esthetician may be comfortable with performing. if you are considering having a skin-care treatment at a medical spa as opposed to a physicians office it would be prudent to ask the following questions: 1. is there a md on site or available for me to see? 2. what is the medical directors specialty? it is not unheard of for some spas to meet the licensure requirement to merely appoint a willing md who is not necessarily trained in skin management. the appropriate specialties are plastic surgery facial plastic surgery and dermatology. your skin deserves as much prudence in selecting professionals to care for it as any other part of your body.,[],wmd

what happens to someone when they get malaria?,when you're bitten by a malaria -infected mosquito the parasites that cause malaria are injected into your blood and invade your liver cells. the parasite reproduces in the liver cells which then burst open allowing thousands of new parasites to enter the bloodstream and infect red blood cells. the parasites reproduce again in the blood cells kill the blood cells and then move to other uninfected blood cells. the time from the initial malaria infection until symptoms appear (incubation period) generally ranges from: 1 9 to 14 days for plasmodium (p. ) falciparum. 12 to 18 days for p. vivax and p. ovale. 18 to 40 days for p. malariae. 11 to 12 days for p. knowlesi. symptoms can appear in 7 days. occasionally the time between exposure and signs of illness may be as long as 8 to 10 months with p. vivax and p. ovale because these parasites can survive in the human liver for a long time. the incubation period may be longer if you are taking medicine to prevent infection (chemoprophylaxis) or have developed partial immunity due to previous infections. malaria can begin with flu -like symptoms. in the early stages infection from p. falciparum is similar to infection from p. vivax p. malariae and p. ovale. you may have no symptoms or symptoms that are less severe if you are immune or partially immune to malaria. common malaria symptoms include: fever. chills and a rapidly rising temperature. headaches nausea and extreme sweating. symptoms may appear in cycles. the time between episodes of fever and other symptoms varies with the specific parasite you are infected with. episodes of symptoms may occur: every 48 hours if you are infected with p. vivax or p. ovale. every 72 hours if you are infected with p. malariae. p. falciparum does not usually have a regular cyclic fever. after the early stages life-threatening complications develop rapidly with p. falciparum and p. knowlesi and if untreated may result in irreversible complications or death. 2 if untreated you may recover in a week to a month (or longer) after being infected with p. vivax p. malariae or p. ovale. malaria can be a very serious disease for a pregnant woman and her unborn baby ( fetus ) and for young children. medication choices are limited for a pregnant woman or a child. infection with p. falciparum can lead to death for a pregnant woman and her fetus. for these reasons a pregnant woman should not travel to an area where she could get p. falciparum malaria. visit the cdc web site (www. cdc. gov/malaria/travel/index. htm) to find out whether malaria is a problem in the country where you will be traveling. malaria recurrences malaria caused by p. falciparum may come back (recur) at irregular intervals for up to 2 years if treatment is not complete. malaria caused by p. vivax and p. ovale may recur at irregular intervals for up to 3 to 4 years but medication treatment can prevent relapses. p. malariae can remain in the blood of an infected person for more than 30 years usually without causing any symptoms. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,['malaria'],wmd
what can i do to minimize itching and redness from eczema and winter itch?,many people dont realize that winter itch is a form of eczema one that tends to run in families. if your parents have it chances are that you and your children will develop it too. even babies can suffer from winter itch. even if you are genetically prone to eczema you can still take steps to protect your skin which may prevent eczema or at least ensure only a mild case. first of all moisturize your skin. this is the crucial step because you want to keep the skin barrier intact. even if it has turned warm again outside now is the time to start using the most effective moisturizers you can find. drugstores sell inexpensive yet highly effective petrolatum-based ointments and creams that are heavy enough to protect the skin. it is a very good idea to use these or a moisturizing lotion right after your bath or shower when the skin is still damp. oils work well too. for daytime wear when you may want to use something a little lighter and less greasy look for creams and lotions that contain hyaluronic acid shea butter avocado oil or glycerin. dimethicone a silicone-based ingredient works for many but not for those whose skin is prone to acne since it can increase breakouts. hands contain comparatively few oil glands and tend to dry and crack easily. the use of those alcohol-based sanitizers doesnt help either. not only do they dry skin more than good old soap and water theyarent as effective at killing viruses and bacteria. actually you dont even have to use soap which is undeniably drying to wash your hands. products marketed as gentle cleansers for sensitive skins work beautifully; carry a small bottle in your bag and use it instead of those scented soaps in public restrooms. in fact stay away from scented soaps period since they tend to irritate the skin. as for deodorant soaps they are absolutely terrible for anybody prone to winter itch – ditch them immediately! take shorter showers and baths and try to use a moisturizing body wash or a super-fatted soap. ifyour skin is very sensitive you can use the same gentle facial cleanser i recommend for hands.,"['atopic dermatitis', 'itch']",wmd

my testosterone level is a 9 yet my doctor did not recommend injections. what is going on.?,testosterone is the major male hormone. there are three different types of blood tests that can be used to measure testosterone levels. so the first step in understanding your level is to find out which test was used and the normal range for men in your age group. total testosterone is the most common test used. it measures all the testosterone in your blood. a typical range for men over 19 is 240-950 ng/dl but the results vary depending on the lab used. you can also measure free testosterone. free testosterone is a measure of the testosterone that is not bound to proteins in the blood. a typical range for men is 9-30 ng/dl. obesity affects the level of sex hormone binding proteins so your doctor may order a free testosterone level if you are obese. historically it was thought that only free testosterone was able to exert hormonal effects. we now know that testosterone bound to the protein albumin can also exert effects. bioavailable testosterone measures this level. bioavailable testosterone varies depending on the age of the man. for a man in his 20s the normal range of bioavailable testosterone would be 83-257 ng/dl but for a man in his 60s it would be 40-168 ng/dl. normal ranges differ depending on the laboratory used so be sure to discuss with your doctor what is the appropriate normal range for the lab where the test was done. if your testosterone level is low it is important to re-test the level to determine if a lab error or just a daily variation has occurred. the amount of testosterone varies at different times of the day so this is a blood test that needs to be repeated before making medical decisions. it is always important to make sure lab tests correlates with your symptoms. low testosterone levels in men causes decreased sexual desire erectile dysfunction and infertility. however testosterone also has other important functions. it affects behavior muscle mass and bone density. therefore a man with low testosterone can develop osteoporosis. finally in understanding testosterone levels your doctor needs to determine whether the root of the problem is a result of a problem in the testicles where testosterone is produced or if there is a problem in the part of the brain that controls the production of testosterone. measuring lh and fsh hormones produced in the pituitary of the brain will help make that distinction. once this information is available your doctor can decide how you need to be treated. testosterone replacement in the form of a patch gel or injection is usually given. but as with all medications there are cautions. testosterone can increase the size of the prostate and may cause worsening symptoms in men with benign prostatic hypertrophy and aggravate prostate cancer. so talk with your doctor to understand your test and his concerns.,"['testosterone', 'injection']",wmd

18 years old already have 2 kids can i get a hysterectomy? . i'm 18 years old i already have 2 kids and i don't want anymore my period is extremely painful and heavy will a doctor give me a hysterectomy or am i to young?,it would be highly unlikely for any surgeon (or an insurance company that would pay for this elective procedure) to agree that a hysterectomy is the way to go at this point. it is not just your age that is a contributing factor but a hysterectomy is not medically-indicated in most cases just because you have two kids and your periods are heavy/painful. see your gynecologist and i am sure there are other solutions to answer your concerns that are considerably less riskier than removing your uterus. thank you for asking with the age of just 18 i am afraid going for hysterectomy is unwise although possible. procedures like hysterectomy are permanent and there is no coming back and depression and other psychological accidents are common in such women as well. also there is a long life ahead for you you may wanna change your mind to have another child due to any reason and then you will need a uterus to conceive. so my suggestion is don't opt for it unless you have some severe problem with uterus like heavy periods etc. hysterectomy can wait till 35 years or older age. i hope it helps. regards dr s khan ehealthdesk,"['hysterectomy', 'period']",wmd
is sinusitis contagious?,viral infections that lead to sinusitis may be contagious; bacterial sinusitis is generally not. its important to remember that most viral upper respiratory infections (common colds) cause nasal congestion which may involve the sinuses. if the viral sinus infection lasts well past the normal duration of a cold viral sinusitis may be diagnosed. these viruses are highly contagious and likely to cause a cold in others who come in contact with them. bacterial sinusitis most often occurs as a complication of a viral common cold. bacteria that are normally present in the nose and throat take advantage of the viral infection to invade the inflamed sinus passages. these sinusitis-causing bacteria may be passed from person to person but wont cause an infection unless the right conditions are present. unlike with cold viruses most people will not develop sinusitis even if they are exposed to the bacteria. are sinus infections contagious/ i don't know.,['sinus infection'],wmd

increasingly doctors will not take medicare because they don't get reimbursed enough. what is being done about this?,unfortunately the payment issue with medicare dates back to the early nineties to a formula that congress put in place which is supposed to be updated on a yearly basis and congress has fallen far behind. so they fix it a little step at a time. the president has called on congress since he came into office to fix it permanently. lets make sure that medicare is a good payer for docs. lets make sure docs on into the future understand that their services are essential to make sure that medicare beneficiaries get access to great care. and we will continue to work on that. this isnt an impact of the affordable care act. this actually has been a decade that congress has really failed to look at the overall payments for doctors with medicare beneficiaries. but weve got 45 million people including my 89-year-old father who is a medicare beneficiary and really depends on those incredibly important services. and having physicians who provide that excellent care is a part of the partnership and were going to make sure that happens into the future.,['medicare'],wmd

are people who carry the hepatitis b virus but who do not have liver disease or hepatitis at risk for liver cancer?,"the answer is probably yes. usually individuals at risk for developing liver cancer are those with cirrhosis (advanced liver disease with permanent liver scarring). in other words cirrhosis is a precancerous condition. in fact patients with cirrhosis regardless of the underlying cause are at increased risk of developing liver cancer for example patients with cirrhosis from chronic hepatitis c chronic hepatitis b hemochromatosis alcohol and fatty liver. some of these groups of patients should have periodic ultrasound examinations of the liver as well as blood tests for alpha fetoprotein (a blood test that is produced by liver cancers) to detect the development of liver cancer early. there is one group of patients without cirrhosis that is at risk of developing liver cancer; that group of patients has chronic infection with the hepatitis b virus. a typical patient would be somebody born with hepatitis b infection contracted from his/her mother at birth (common in asia). the baby's immature immune system does not recognize the hepatitis b virus as ""foreign"" and thus tolerates the virus. (the body's immune system does not wage war against the virus. ) the hepatitis b virus is able to multiply and flourish in the body without causing the hepatitis (liver inflammation caused by the immune system) that leads to cirrhosis. however the virus can damage the dna in the liver cells and cause liver cancer. these patients typically have high levels of hepatitis b virus in their blood but normal liver enzymes and normal liver biopsies. such patients should have ultrasound examinations of the liver and alpha fetoprotein blood tests every six months to look for developing liver cancers.","['hepatitis', 'hepatitis b', 'cancer', 'liver', 'virus']",wmd

why is it that obesity doesn't always cause type 2 diabetes?,it is true that the more severe the degree of obesity the greater the odds of type 2 diabetes. that's because the excess body fat fuels insulin resistance in the muscles and organs. there may be adverse hormonal effects on the beta cells as well. after years of insulin resistance the beta cells wear down to the point where prediabetes or full type 2 diabetes occurs but only in a certain fraction of indiviiduals with obesity. we don't fully understand why some people with obesity are at risk for diabetes while others can be obese their whole lives without getting it. the answer is likely in the genetics but we don't know which genes confer protection or susceptibility. similarly some thin people develop type 2 diabetes despite minimal insulin resistance. again the answer is in the genes but we don't know which genes.,"['type 2 diabetes', 'obesity']",wmd

"" everybody is different so that may not work for you. what it boils down to is you are a person not a lab result; if you have symptoms tell your primary care doctor. do some research write down questions/symptoms when you think of them and talk to your pcp about it. if you do not think he or she is taking you seriously get a second opinion.","['hypothyroidism', 'hand', 'blood test', 'weight']",wmd

can you put regular vicks on an infant? . im wanting to put vicks on my baby because she has a cold that comes with a cough. so i was wondering does it have to be baby vicks or can you use the regular type adults use? and if so what is the difference between the two? i was planning to put it on her feet because she has a pretty bad cough and i heard that doing that can really help also she is a few days shy of turning 5 months if that changes anything. thanks in advance!,we do not recommend vicks for the babies in our clinic even though our parents used it on us and we survived. the ingredients in vicks has the potential of making a cough worse due to an allergic or irritant response so we don't endorse it. and i have to say that vicks on the feet will only make the feet a bit softer because of the petroleum jelly but it will not cure a cold or calm a cough. please don't tell your mother or grandmother that i told you this! a five month old is experiencing our germ-filled world for the first time on her own  your maternal immunity will completely wear out by six months even if you are breast-feeding. because they are so darn cute at this age people pick them up touch them and expose them so their cuteness is their own fault. she is also teething and drooling so this drainage is contributing to the cough when she is lying down. coughing helps clear her airway and helps prevent the fluid from going in her lungs. so it is really a good thing. use a cool mist humidifier suck out the nose (i know they hate it) and just hang in there. colds last a week or two but she will average 6-9 of these per year from now on. until she is about six. each cold makes her a bit stronger so think of these frequent viral episodes as free immunizations.,"['infant', 'baby', 'coldness', 'cold', 'cough']",wmd

what exams and tests help doctors to evaluate or test people for hyperthyroidism?,your doctor will ask questions about your medical history do a physical exam and order medical tests to diagnose hyperthyroidism. if your doctor thinks you may have hyperthyroidism he or she may order: a thyroid-stimulating hormone (tsh) test which is a blood test that measures your levels of tsh. if your tsh level is low your doctor will want to do more tests. thyroid hormone tests which are blood tests to measure your levels of two types of thyroid hormones called t3 and t4. if your thyroid hormone levels are high you have hyperthyroidism. when you are being treated for hyperthyroidism your doctor will test your tsh and thyroid hormones several times a year to see how well your treatment is working. after you are diagnosed with hyperthyroidism your doctor may also want to do: an antithyroid antibody test to see if you have the kind of antibodies that attack thyroid tissue. this test can help diagnose graves' disease and autoimmune thyroiditis. a radioactive thyroid scan and radioactive iodine uptake tests which use radiation and a special camera to determine the cause of your hyperthyroidism. if you have graves' ophthalmopathy your doctor may also do an ultrasound mri or a ct scan to look more closely at your eyes. early detection it is not clear whether people who do not have any risk factors and who do not have any symptoms of hyperthyroidism need to be tested regularly for thyroid problems. the american thyroid association recommends that adults particularly women be screened for thyroid problems every 5 years beginning at age 35. but the u. s. preventive services task force does not think there is enough evidence to recommend either for or against regular thyroid testing. talk to your doctor about whether you need to be tested for thyroid problems. 1 2 webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,['hyperthyroidism'],wmd

what are the risk factors that cause malnutrition for someone with ulcerative colitis?,one of the primary risk factors for malnourishment with ulcerative colitis is a decreased intake of food. when uc flares there is inflammation of the large intestine or colon and small sores form on the lining of the intestine and rectum. this causes persistent cramping pain. it also causes severe diarrhea alternating with the formation of hard stool and prolonged constipation. diet doesn't cause ulcerative colitis. but certain foods may make symptoms worse. so in addition to the normal loss of appetite that accompanies a flare-up some people purposely reduce how much they eat in an attempt to ease the symptoms or out of fear of symptoms getting worse. at the same time the body has an increased need for additional calories protein vitamins and minerals to aid the healing process. also the inflammation and diarrhea interfere with the reabsorption of water and minerals that normally occurs in the large intestine and there is a danger of becoming dehydrated if the fluid is not replaced. finally some of the medications that are used to treat ulcerative colitis interfere with the body's ability to absorb and maintain the minerals it needs. for instance corticosteroids such as prednisone can deplete the body's calcium. medicines like sulfasalazine deplete the level of folate an important b vitamin.,"['ulcerative colitis', 'malnutrition']",wmd

how do i choose a health care provider for pregnancy?,before you choose a health care provider for pregnancy the first question to ask is whether your pregnancy is likely to be normal and uncomplicated or complicated and high-risk? if you have high blood pressure diabetes or a history of previous pregnancy complications are younger than 18 or 35 and older you should seek care from a health care provider experienced in treating women with your type of medical condition such as an ob/gyn or perinatologist. if you are at low risk for complications your family practitioner or a nurse midwife may be right for you. once you decide the type of provider that best suits your needs you will need to select one person in particular. you may want to schedule an introductory visit to meet with the health care provider you are considering and determine if you feel comfortable with him or her. here are some questions to ask during your meeting. how long have you been in practice? when and where did you receive training? are you board-certified? do you have professional or patient references? have you had any problems with your medical practice? to get this information contact your state medical licensing board. what are your general philosophies about pregnancy labor and delivery? think about how they fit in with your own beliefs. how many babies do you deliver per week? how many children do you have? are you in a group practice? if so will i see every provider with whom you rotate during my doctor visits? do i have a choice about whom i see and who delivers my baby? note: if you choose a health care provider who belongs to a group practice usually all the members of the group will see you during your pregnancy and one of them will be there for the delivery. who will i see at each appointment? will you be in town around my due date? note that there are no guarantees that a specific health care provider will deliver your baby since no provider is available 24 hours a day; make sure you know the other providers in the practice or with whom the doctor shares delivery responsibility. if i have a question who do i call? who responds to the calls? do you accept questions via e-mail? am i allowed to write a personal birth plan? will it be respected? a personal birth plan is a written agreement between you and your doctor as to how your baby will be delivered. it gives the parents more of a role in the decision making process; however the plan is no guarantee that your birthing process will go as planned since complications can arise. if complications arise your doctor will make decisions based on your and your baby's safety. what is your policy on inducing labor if i go beyond my due date? another important thing to consider when selecting a health care provider is where you want to deliver. if you have a certain place in mind you need to make sure that person can deliver your baby there.,['pregnancy'],wmd

can sleep affect how well i see and remember things?,red. orange. yellow. green. blue. purple. look around and pay attention to the color you see. is it bright and vivid? better or worse than yesterday? now think about how well you slept last night. or the night before. could it be that your ability to see colors depends on a good nights sleep? now this is fascinating stuff: research just emerging and presented at the 24th annual meeting of the associated professional sleep societies (apss) earlier this month suggests that sleep literally colors your view of the world. put simply sleep restores your ability to see and process colors correctly. the technicality of how this all works (and how the researchers went about figuring this out) is pretty complex but suffice it to say that color perception — whether or not you see gray or green for instance shifts while youre awake thus distorting what color youre really seeing. and overnight sleep brings your color recognition back in line with whats really there. so when you see gray you can be sure its in fact gray and not green. according to the authors scientists had not previously investigated how sleep might affect the way we see the world around us. but ill point out that other recent research has discovered that our ability to recognize and remember faces is indeed influenced by the amount of sleep we get. these two abilities (distinguishing color and faces) are not so different when you consider the science behind sleep and our memory banks. sleep has a profound effect on our memories. its well-documented for example that sleep plays a big role in helping us to:  remember things.  learn new information.  process data efficiently.  consolidate memories. (in fact its believed that dreams may play a special role in that consolidation though we dont know exactly how that all works yet. ) and of course we need to have sharp memories in order to recall colors and different faces — relationships that we learn. just as you learn to know that red is red and green is green you also learn which faces belong to your best friend first grade teacher and mother. what i love about this latest study is that it examines an aspect of life so prized by humans: being able to see a spectrum of color. this skill has enhanced human interactions for millennia helpful to not just social interactions but in some cases survival. granted some people who are truly color-blind dont have trouble getting through life. but if given the opportunity i think most people would prefer to see all the colors of the rainbow clearly. even if seeing color doesnt always equate with survival it sure makes life more exciting and in a word vivid. so the next time you cant distinguish blue from green so well (and youre bickering with a significant other over whether or not that tie is blue-gray or green-gray) ask yourself: did you get a good nights sleep? keep that memory sharp. enjoy the beauty of the world around you. keep up the good nights.,['vision'],wmd

i havent had a period in over 2. 5 yrs do i need to stay on the pill?,hi. this fsh is elevated and it looks likely consistent with menopause or a lack of feedback to the pituitary gland from the production of estrogen for some time. estrogen is related to the monthly development of follicular cysts which produce the ovum each month. this high level of fsh would indicate that this has probably not occured in several months for some reason. this reason may be menopause but that is as specific as i can be based on this result alone.,['birth control pill'],qd
how is obsessive compulsive disorder (ocd) diagnosed?,some practitioners will administer a self-test of screening questions to individuals whom they suspect may be suffering from ocd. in addition to looking for symptoms of obsessions and compulsions by conducting a mental-status examination mental-health professionals will explore the possibility that the individual's symptoms are caused by another emotional illness instead of or in addition to ocd. for example people with an addiction often have obsessions or compulsions but those symptom characteristics generally only involve the object of the addiction. the practitioner will also likely ensure that a physical examination and any other appropriate tests have been done recently to explore whether there is any medical problem that could be contributing to the signs or symptoms of ocd.,['obsessive-compulsive disorder'],wmd

can a blocked utera cause backup in the kidney of toxins and create skin rash and bumps,i need to know whether you mean blocked urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body) or blocked ureter (one of the two tubes that lead each from one of the kidneys to the urinary bladder). my late father once had a kidney stone that blocked one of his ureters causing hydronephrosis - his urine was backing up into the kidney. it was very dangerous and his urologist had to install a stent to keep the ureter open wider until he passed the kidney stone. during the time he had the stent he became temporarily incontinent and had to wear men's depends but after it was resolved that problem went away. [years later however both his kidneys failed completely. since he was dying of cancer at the time no one ever figured out why. ] if you have a blocked ureter the kidney to which it belongs will develop hydronephrosis unless it is treated; a urologist would need to tend to that and quickly. if on the other hand what is blocked is not one of the ureters but your urethra that would also be an emergency possibly a much more immediately urgent one. if the urethra is totally blocked the bladder cannot empty at all and will eventually burst upward through the dome. depending upon why the urethra is blocked treatment may involve passing a catheter into the bladder or even emergency surgery to remove the obstruction. if the urethra is partially blocked only a small amount of urine may emerge the bladder will become overdistended and a uti will be highly likely to develop; plus the condition will be extremely painful. in that case it becomes necessary to have a catheter passed into the bladder to empty it and then the condition that caused the blocked urethra treated. in men this is most likely to be caused by a swollen prostate gland. in women injury to the urethra and certain types of vaginal swelling are most likely though many other conditions are possible. in either case - whether it's your urethra or one of your ureters that is blocked - it needs medical attention. the sooner the better. as for the skin rash a doctor would have to look at that to see if it's connected but i do know that in actual kidney failure small crystals of uric acid or urea salts actually emerge through the pores of the skin but by the time this happens the person is near death and is not likely to be using a computer. the rash could still be connected in some way to the underlying condition though because it is true that either a blocked ureter or a blocked urethra result in toxins not being properly eliminated by the body. the most important thing is to get medical treatment for the blockage and then tend to the rest. good luck.,"['kidney', 'skin', 'rash']",wmd

do doctors immediately prescribe medication to control blood sugar or do they wait to see if diet and exercise help?,standard guidelines recommend a general approach of starting with lifestyle modification (eating and exercise) and then adding medications if blood sugar levels are not adequately controlled. if diabetes is newly diagnosed because a patient presents with symptoms of high blood sugar (such as excess thirst excess urination blurry vision etc. ) then we typically use medication immediately to bring the blood sugar closer to normal and alleviate the symptoms. furthermore metformin is approved to use in prediabetes to delay or prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes and one can justify using metformin in anyone with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes. the threshold for starting medication can therefore be any point between a1c of about 5. 9 to 7. 0. once the a1c is higher than 7. 0 it is harder to justify delaying medication. in any case doctors and patients need to have discussions about the benefits risks and drawbacks of using medications and these benefits risks and drawbacks change depending on the degree of glucose control and the type of drug(s) being considered. personally i start to think about starting metformin if a patient cant keep the a1c below 6. 5. if someone wants to use lifestyle change and weight loss to reduce medication i usually discontinue the sulfonylurea type drugs (glyburide glipizide) if the blood sugar levels start to dip below around 70-80 mg/dl or the a1c goes below 6. 5. i like to stop the metformin once the a1c stays below 6. 0 for about 3 months provided that the patient can maintain or extend the weight loss and lifestyle changes.,"['blood sugar', 'vision', 'exercise', 'diet', 'drug']",wmd

what can i do to treat food allergies at home?,"knowing which foods trigger food allergies and avoiding those foods is the best way to prevent allergic reactions. unfortunately food allergens are often ""hidden"" in sauces ice creams baked goods and other items. if you have food allergies read food labels carefully. be aware of other names for food allergens such as ""caseinate"" for milk or ""albumin"" for eggs. many people think that seeing ""nondairy"" on a label means there is no milk in the product. this is not necessarily true. sometimes products are recalled when food ingredients are missing from food labels. for a list of recalled products see the u. s. food and drug administration's recalls market withdrawals and safety alerts page at www. fda. gov/opacom/7alerts. html. eating out can be dangerous for people with severe food allergies. here are some tips: bring safe substitutes from home. for example bring soy milk to have with cereal. be aware of possible cross-contamination. for example an ice cream scoop may have been used for rocky road ice cream which contains peanuts and then used for your vanilla ice cream. alert the wait staff to the possibility of a severe food reaction. carefully question them about ingredients. if they are not sure ask to speak to kitchen staff. always wear medical alert jewelry that lists your food allergies. medical alert jewelry can be ordered through most pharmacies or on the internet. if you or your child has ever had a severe allergic reaction always carry an allergy kit that contains a syringe of epinephrine and antihistamine tablets. give the epinephrine shot as soon as you or your child feels a reaction starting. then take the antihistamine. for more information about the shot see: allergies: giving yourself an epinephrine shot. allergies in children: giving an epinephrine shot to a child. if you are traveling to another country learn the words for the foods that trigger your allergy so that you can ask in restaurants and read food labels. call airlines tour operators and restaurants ahead of time to explain your food allergy and request safe meals. prepare your own food when possible. discuss your travel plans with your doctor. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.",['food allergy'],wmd
can janumet and zantac be taken together?,there is a moderate interaction with one of the components found in janumet (metformin/sitagliptin) and zantac (ranitidine). ranitidine is a cationic drug and theoretically could decrease the excretion of metformin. this drug interaction has been observed when using another cationic medication cimetidine. because of this we use caution with similar medications. these interactions can increase the risk of lactic acidosis which included symptoms of malaise myalgia respiratory distress hyperventilation slow or irregular heartbeat somnolence abdominal upset or other unusual symptoms. lactic acidosis is a possible side effect from the metformin. consult your health-care professional if both of these medications are being prescribed together. monitor your reactions for side effects of lactic acidosis and stop medication right away if the symptoms occur.,[],wmd

can losing sleep now affect the rest of my life?,anyone who has a family member suffering from dementia or alzheimers knows how difficult and heartbreaking these illnesses are. and its often anyones guess as to what ultimately causes dementia in a given person. what about sleep habits? well it turns out that we may have clues now to a link between the development of dementia and a sleep disorder known as rapid eye movement (rem) sleep behavior disorder (lets call it rbd for short). the facts:  with rbd the paralysis that normally occurs during rem sleep is incomplete or absent allowing you to act out your dreams. translation: youre not experiencing typical rem sleep that keeps you in a normal cycle of sleep.  these dreams are often vivid and violent compelling you to talk punch kick scream and even jump out of bed. translation: youre not getting the restful sleep you need.  rbd is usually seen in middle-aged to elderly people and more often in men. the researchers of this latest study found that 63 percent of people who experienced rbd developed dementia with lewy bodies or parkinsons disease in later life. in some cases the disorder was detected up to 50 years before the neurodegenerative condition developed. its not too surprising that rbd is also linked to parkinsons as 30 to 60 percent of people with parkinsons disease develop dementia. fyi: lewy body dementia is a rare form of dementia whereby small round clumps of normal proteins called lewy bodies (named after their discoverer) become abnormally clumped together inside brain cells. whether the lewy bodies directly cause gradual damage to the brain cells impairing their function and eventually killing them or are only a marker of some other destructive process is not known. scary? weve already seen that sleep loss causes brain loss. and when you look at the risk factors for dementia — eating a healthy diet engaging in regular exercise — both of which have been shown to reduce the risk of developing dementia by up to 60 percent is there any surprise that getting a good nights sleep is just as important? clearly we need more studies done to help us understand the associations between sleep habits and our risk for illness later in life. we also need more information on associations that go beyond just rare sleep disorders like rbd. the statistics are far too breathtaking:  one in three people over 65 will die with dementia.  twenty percent of us dont get enough sleep — banking less than 6 hours of sleep on average.  heart disease diabetes and obesity have all been linked with chronic sleep loss. so what can a lifelong battle with insomnia for example do to you in your golden years? insomnia by the way is the most common sleep disorder affecting approximately 64 million americans regularly each year. will a seemingly harmless struggle to get a good nights sleep in your prime position your body for ill health later on? unfortunately studies increasingly are pointing to yes. sleep matters. today. tomorrow. and long into our futures. the single most important thing you can do today to safeguard your health tomorrow might not be just what you eat and how you move. it must also include how well you sleep.,[],wmd

how can i move on with my life after a divorce? what about dating?,divorce isn't just the end of an official contract; it is a legal surgery that separates two people whose lives have been joined. particularly after long marriages it is painful and traumatic and people need time to heal afterward. moving on in a healthy way — healing from the pain of divorce — requires that you feel the pain. otherwise you are just covering a wound that is likely to fester under the surface demanding attention at some later time. so it is important to allow yourself to feel the hurt anger sadness or whatever other emotional distress that your divorce inflicts upon you. then you can actively take steps forward toward a happier future. at some point you will likely want to date again. hopefully at this point you will have a life filled with many things and people that you enjoy. also if you know what you are looking for in a person (i. e. respectful partner someone to go hiking with) and relationship (i. e. just fun long term commitment) then you are more likely to find it; and feel fulfilled by it. knowing what you want is also very important when you have children. consider your child's age and personality as you decide how to proceed. consider how much you want him or her exposed to your dating life. you will probably want to shelter them a bit from your exploration as each new date might unrealistically be seen as a possible threat (i. e. taking your attention dashing hopes of reconciliation with your ex-spouse) or savior (i. e. joining the family to once again make it complete). where can you meet people? how can you go about this? while it's not easy it's not impossible either. your attitude is critical. being happy hopeful and open to meeting someone can help you. because dating can be a bumpy road a positive attitude can also help you to bounce along without feeling too bruised. here are some concrete suggestions for finding a partner: 1) let people know that you are interested in dating; you might be surprised who can set you up with someone and who that someone might be (hopefully the partner of your dreams though you must also be prepared for the date of your nightmares). 2) join activities or clubs that interest you; then you will be happy with what you are doing whether or not you meet a special someone. 3) find out about singles activities and try some out. 4) try online dating services. there are many of them; just a few popular ones are as match. com eharmony. com perfectmatch. com and lavalife. com,['movement'],wmd

does dehydration change color of poop?,dehydration definitely causes a change in stool consistency but not usually color. water is actually stored in the colon (not the bladder) and can be used by the body when needed. during times of dehydration water is pulled from the colon and will result in dry hard stools (constipation). stool color changes can be due to many things. for instance if you took pepto bismol your stool would turn black from the bismuth. the types of foods that you may eat may also change stool color. knowing the color of the stool can give a clinician a clue as to the reason.,['dehydration'],wmd

i have pcos. why do i gain weight if i'm active and eat well? can i get back to the way i was last year (100 lbs less)? . i used to be a model. very healthly and very active. i went on the birth control pill for a couple of weeks but they made me very sick so i went off of them. that is when this all started. i have always been very active and very healthy. now i'm losing all of my hair; very seldom do i menstrate; i have excessive body hair growth; i gained about 100 pounds; and i have many more symptoms. i have been tossed back and fourth between doctors and noone helps me: they just brush me off on to others.,"pcos is the most common hormonal problem in young women. it can cause infertility diabetes and an increased risk of some cancers. the signs of this condition often include irregular periods acne and increase or abnormal distribution of body hair. most women with pcos have problems with weight management. there are many treatments that target specific goals: oral contraception normalizes periods improves acne and can help reduce facial hair; diabetes medications help improve insulin sensitivity and reduces the risk of insulin resistant and type 2 diabetes; ovulation induction can help women achieve pregnancy; but dieting exercise and weight loss are the cornerstone of treatment and targets all of the above. pcos cannot be cured but it can be treated so its important to stick to your treatment. even more critical is that you know what your treatments targets. not all women with pcos have the same objectives when seeking medical care. it appears that your goal is successful weight loss and weight management. you need a health care team that knows how to handle weight issues more aggressively. set realistic goals: what are your pounds per week to loss? whats a reasonable calorie restriction for you? whats your exercise plan? and how will you monitor these intervention and stick with your plan? your plan will help you and your healthcare providers move you toward weight loss and better health. one of many suggestions that i give patients are apps for smart phones and a buddy systems for exercise. you'll be more accountable and likely to follow through. at the time of your follow up your doctor will then have information to push more aggressively through better nutritional consultation prescription medications or surgery. do not take this lightly! i went several years after being diagnosed with pcos and having mds tell me to exercise and diet even though i was. they looked at me like i was crazy and just flat out lieing to them. it took me many many years to find a doctor that actually did some tests which lead to a biopsy which was possitive for cancer. everyone else said i was too young in my early 30's to have any such problem. the biopsy results came in on a friday morning and i had a full hysterectomy and oopherectomy the following monday. after i healed from surgery i lost a 50 pounds without doing anything different at all. i still continue to loose weight without doing anything extreme. im about 35 pounds overweight my self 40 yr old male loved to eat and had a few problems with my health. so i turned evil and went on a 10 day lemonwater cleansing. lost 14 pounds and i feel better. my outlook on everything has changed in 10 painful and long days. so i say to you give it a try. you dont have to go 10 days just start out for 3 days and see how you feel! the more days you do it is the more toxins leaving your body. goodluck to ya! i have a friend who has pcos and successfully got many of the symptoms under control including the weight gain and had 2 children. the key though is finding the right doctor who will really partner with you on getting it under control. my message to you is that it's not hopeless but with all the ways it affects your hormones a doctor is really going to need to work with you. i found this article that had a bunch of info. you might already know all this stuff but if you don't i hope it helps.  i am not a doctor nor do i claim to be able to completely and utterly answer your question. but one thing that is (likely) happening is that your insulin level is increasing. this would be one cause of the lack of menstruation you're having. also though birth control makes you sick you may want to try a different type. with pcos there are a lot of hormones that are ""out of whack.

how does atherosclerosis cause disease?,there are two ways atherosclerosis causes disease. 1) atherosclerosis can limit the ability of the narrowed arteries to increase delivery of blood and oxygen to tissues during periods of increased oxygen demand such as during exertion. 2) complete obstruction of an artery by a thrombus or embolus (thrombus and embolus are forms of blood clots) resulting in tissue necrosis (death of tissue). exertional angina and intermittent claudication are two examples of insufficient delivery of blood and oxygen to meet tissue demand. strokes and heart attacks are examples of death of tissue caused by complete artery obstruction by blood clots. there are many similarities between coronary artery diseases (atherosclerosis involving the arteries of the heart) and peripheral artery disease. for example patients with exertional angina typically have no symptoms at rest. but during exertion the critically narrowed coronary arteries are incapable of increasing blood and oxygen delivery to meet the increased oxygen needs of the heart muscles. lack of blood and oxygen causes chest pain (exertional angina). exertional angina typically subsides when the patient rests. in patients with intermittent claudication the narrowed arteries in the lower extremities (for example a narrowed artery at the groin) cannot increase blood and oxygen delivery to the calf muscles during walking. these patients experience pain in the calf muscles that will only subside after resting. patients with unstable angina have critically narrowed coronary arteries that cannot deliver enough blood and oxygen to the heart muscle even at rest. these patients have chest pain at rest and are at imminent risk of developing heart attacks. patients with severe artery occlusion in the legs can develop rest pain (usually in the feet). rest pain represents such severe occlusion that there is insufficient blood supply to the feet even at rest. they are at risk of developing foot ulcers and gangrene. when the arteries are narrowed as a result of atherosclerosis blood tends to clot in the narrowed areas forming a so-called thrombus (plural thrombi). sometimes pieces of the thrombi break off and travel in the bloodstream until they are trapped in a narrower point in the artery beyond which they cannot pass. a thrombus or piece of thrombus that travels to another point is called an embolus (pleural emboli). thrombi and emboli can cause sudden and complete artery blockage leading to tissue necrosis (death of tissue). for example complete blockage of a coronary artery by a thrombus causes heart attack while complete blockage of a carotid or cerebral artery causes ischemic stroke. emboli originating from atherosclerosis in the aorta (the main artery delivering blood to the body) can obstruct small arteries in the feet resulting in painful and blue (cyanotic) toes foot ulcers and even gangrene.,['atherosclerosis'],wmd

first time taking birth control but period is late and unprotected sex am i pregnant? . my period came july 4 first time taking the pill. so my period is always a 28 day cycle. on august 4 my period didn't come and i had unprotected sex more than twice that day. and for the rest of week i had unprotected sex and my period hasn't came yet. is there a big possibility i am pregnant?,"hi what your about to read did you do this? the effectiveness of most birth control pills is strongly affected by how consistently they are taken. the effectiveness or side effects of birth control pills can be altered by taking them late or by not taking them at the same time each day. therefore to get the highest effectiveness from birth control pills take them at the same time every day. if you miss one of more pills refer to the manufacturer package insert that came with your pills. in general for most pills the following should be followed: if you have a 28-day pack and you missed any of the last 7 pills in the pack - don't worry about it (except mircette where the last 7 pills do matter). in a 28-day pack the last 7 pills are placebo or ""sugar"" pills. these have no active ingredients; the pills are just there to help you know when to start your new pack. but make sure you start your new pack on time. if you miss taking one or more pills (except the last 7 pills in the 28-day pack) you may not be protected from pregnancy. - see more at: #sthash. ejo0b3gz. dpuf. yes as you can see it was a gathered piece of information i found this a piece of help. so at anytime did you miss a pill or two was your timing out are you now back taking your pills you missing your period could be from just the extra hormones in your body they can do things like missing a period but you should have just kept to the pattern of taken your bc pills. but as long as you used condoms for the first 7 days and with not getting your period in the placebo week you should have been using condoms with not having a period with luck you may not be pregnant. do hope this helps you. good luck ps if like most of us and you have a mobile phone set the alarm on it for the time you want to take you bc pill its a winner.","['birth control', 'period', 'pregnancy']",wmd

what can i expect during weeks 1 and 2 of my pregnancy?,baby : your baby is still just a glimmer in your eye. although it's confusing to think about a pregnancy starting before your child is even conceived doctors calculate your due date from the beginning of your last cycle since it's hard to know exactly when conception occurred. mom-to-be : at the beginning of a cycle about 20 eggs called ova begin to ripen and occupy fluid-filled sacs called follicles. one of these follicles matures and ruptures releasing an egg that will travel down the fallopian tube where it awaits fertilization. this all takes place about 14 days before the end of your cycle. this is the time you're most fertile so light some candles take the phone off the hook and set aside some intimate time. an egg can be fertilized for only about 12 to 24 hours once the ovum is released. don't be disappointed if it doesn't work the first time. you have only about a 20% chance of getting pregnant each month. tip for the week : make sure you've scheduled a preconception visit with your ob-gyn to determine risks of genetic diseases environmental hazards and lifestyle changes necessary to ensure a healthy pregnancy and baby. most important make sure you've started taking 0. 4 milligrams or 400 micrograms of folic acid a day. folic acid taken a few months before conception has been shown to dramatically reduce the likelihood of neural tube defects such as spina bifida.,['pregnancy'],wmd

my 2 week old is sleeping about 6-7 hours a night. i am breastfeeding and was told to wake her every 3 hours. should i?,you will ultimately want to have thisdiscussion with your pediatrician but when breastfeeding is established and ababy is gaining weight consistently it should be okay to nurse on demand. there may be times where you get longer stretches and that is okay. things to watch for however would be engorgement drop inmilk supply and signs of mastitis (breast infection). often times newborns will go through cluster feedingperiods around 3 and 6 weeks of age so i wouldn't be surprised to see morefrequent feedings in your near future. this happened to me when i was breastfeeding my daughter. she would sleep so much and i let her. my doctor said that aso long as she was gaining weight and having a normal sleep cycle (more at night less during the day) that i could let her sleep. my concern was that my milk continued to drop throughout the night so i would wake up every two to three hours to pump and then freeze the milk. this was great because when my daughter was about five weeks old i got sick and had to stop feeding for a short time due to the medicine that i was on. my suggestion is clearly to get all the sleep you can and just pump in between as necessary. i never had trouble with low milk supply when i did this.,['breastfeed'],wmd

what causes sinusitis?,sinusitis is most often the result of a viral infection that causes the mucous membrane lining the inside of the nose and the sinuses to become inflamed. the mucous membrane swells when it becomes inflamed blocking the drainage of fluid from the sinuses into the nose and throat. mucus and fluid build up inside the sinuses causing pressure and pain. bacteria are more likely to grow in sinuses that are unable to drain properly. bacterial infection in the sinuses often causes more inflammation and pain. while colds usually trigger this process any factor that causes the mucous membrane to become inflamed may lead to sinusitis. many people with nasal allergies ( allergic rhinitis ) for instance are likely to have recurring or long-term (chronic) sinus infections. nasal polyps foreign objects (usually in children) structural problems in the nose such as a deviated septum and other conditions can also block the nasal passages increasing the risk of developing sinusitis. fungal infections may also cause sinusitis. this is especially true in people with impaired immune systems. fungal sinusitis tends to be chronic and more difficult to treat than bacterial sinusitis. more information anatomy and physiology of the nasal cavity webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,['sinus infection'],wmd

can essential tremor get transferred genetically?,i have read your question with care and understand your doubts regarding essential tremors. if not treated the person will not be able to do or will do with much difficulty works involving fingers like writing mixing food button shirts etc. activities which require co-ordinated movements of the fingers will be affected. essential tremors can be due to various reasons and a few of these reasons are transmitted genetically. a few are acquired. even among the ones which are transmitted genetically it can be ad ar xd xr that is autosomal dominant autosomal resistant x-linked dominant and x-linked resistant respectively. so unless we know the exact cause of this tremor we cannot answer about genetic transmission. without knowing the exact cause the answer for this question is 0 to 100 (0 for acquired and 100 for ad). the cure of essential tremor depends on the cause. a few causes can be cured completely a few causes can be controlled and a few cannot be cured at all. again the link with other illness and disorders depends on the cause of the tremor. coming to this particular patient who has this when going to new places or during anxiety this tremors can be controlled with proper medication. you have to consult a neurosurgeon who has had experience in successfully treating such patients for physical evaluation. for further information consult a neuro surgeon online  ,['genetic inheritance'],ic

how can being diabetic and pregnant affect the baby?,"a common problem among the babies of pregnant diabetic women is a condition called ""macrosomia "" which means ""large body. "" in other words babies of diabetic women are apt to be considerably larger than others. this occurs because many of these babies receive too much sugar via the placenta because their mothers have high blood sugar levels. the baby's pancreas senses the high sugar levels and it produces more insulin in an attempt to use up all the extra sugar. that extra sugar is converted to fat making a large baby. sometimes the baby becomes too large to be delivered vaginally and a cesarean delivery becomes necessary. your doctor will closely monitor the size of your baby and will plan for the safest mode of delivery for you and your baby. if you have high blood sugar levels consistently during pregnancy (especially in the 24 hours before delivery) your baby may develop dangerously low blood sugars right after delivery. this is because the baby has high levels of insulin to use up the extra sugars but that source of sugar is suddenly taken away leaving high insulin levels so their blood sugar levels drop quickly. thus your doctor will check your baby's blood sugar levels after birth. if it's low your baby will be given glucose intravenously. your baby may also have mineral imbalances such as calcium or magnesium which can be replaced with medication.","['diabetes', 'pregnancy', 'baby']",wmd
what is the treatment for menstrual migraine?,there are several aspects to treating menstrual migraines: to treat menstrual migraine take medications after the onset. generally medications that are effective in stopping nonmenstrual migraines are effective at also treating menstrual migraines. to prevent menstrual migraine take medications just before the onset of menstruation and continue for the duration of the expected headache. taking hormones such as estrogens or estrogen-related medications also help to prevent migraine. to reduce the frequency and duration of menstrual migraine take prophylactic medications (such as beta-blockers calcium channel blockers anticonvulsants tricyclic antidepressants) that are normally used on a continuous basis to prevent nonmenstrual migraines. nsaids such as naproxen sodium (aleve) or ibuprofen (advil motrin) have been used effectively to treat menstrual migraines. a combination analgesic containing acetaminophen aspirin and caffeine (acc) can also be used to treat menstrual migraines. for women whose menstruation and menstrual migraines occur on a regular and predictable pattern nsaids may be used 24 hours before the expected onset of menstrual migraine and continued for the expected duration of the headache. since nsaids inhibit prostaglandins they have the added benefit of relieving menstrual cramps as well. triptans (naratriptan rizatriptan sumatriptan zolmitriptan) have been found to be effective in treating menstrual migraines as well as controlling the associated nausea and vomiting. sumatriptan given two to three days before and continued for the duration of the expected headache is effective in reducing the frequency and severity of menstrual migraine. naratriptan used in the same manner has also been found to be effective in preventing menstrual migraine. however in those cases where breakthrough headaches occurred they were just as severe as in patients taking placebo. dihydroergotamine (dhe) can be used as a nasal spray or given intramuscularly or intravenously to stop menstrual migraines. ergotamine (oral rectal or intranasal) and dhe (intranasal intramuscular or intravenous) can be used around the time of menstruation (several days before and continued for the duration of the expected headache) to prevent menstrual migraines. if these medications are ineffective doctors may try daily preventive medications such as beta-blockers anticonvulsants calcium channel blockers and tricyclic antidepressants to reduce the frequency and the severity of menstrual migraines. the choice of the preventive medications is based on the experiences and preferences of the doctor the medication side effects and the woman's other associated medical conditions. for women already taking preventive medications who still experience headaches the doses of preventive medications can be increased around the time of menstruation. (some doctors use preventive medications only around the time of menstruation. ) alternatively doctors may try hormone treatment. since a drop in estrogen level just prior to menstruation is the trigger for menstrual migraines estrogen replacement before menstruation has been used in preventing menstrual migraines. for some women with menstrual migraine estradiol skin patches (such as tts 50 tts 100) applied two days before menstrual migraine and continued for seven days during the expected headache period is effective. however the dose of estrogen must be closely monitored as too high of a dose can actually trigger migraine in susceptible individuals. some women with difficult-to-treat menstrual migraines may be helped by using low-dose oral contraceptives to reduce the estrogen fluctuations. other less frequently used medications for menstrual migraines include tamoxifen bromocriptine danazol and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh).,"['migraine', 'menstrual']",wmd

what causes celiac disease?,the destruction of the inner lining of the small intestine in celiac disease is caused by an immunological (allergic) reaction to gluten in the diet that inflames and destroys the inner lining of the small intestine. there is evidence that this reaction is partially genetic and inherited. thus approximately 10% of first-degree relatives (parents siblings or children) of individuals with celiac disease also will have celiac disease. in addition in approximately 30% of fraternal twins and 70% of identical twins both twins will have celiac disease. finally certain genes have been found to be more common among individuals with celiac disease than among individuals without celiac disease. gluten is a family of proteins present in wheat. some of the proteins that make up gluten (the ones that are dissolved by alcohol) are called gliadin. it is the gliadin in gluten that causes the immunological reaction in celiac disease. the mechanism whereby gliadin becomes toxic (damaging) is not clear; however much scientific study is being done and we are beginning to understand the mechanism. proteins including gliadin are long chains of amino acids-up to several hundredattached to each other. normally during digestion digestive enzymes within the small intestine break-up proteins into single amino acids and smaller chains of amino acids. this is necessary because the intestine only can absorb single amino acids or at most chains of 3-4 amino acids. single amino acids and chains of several amino acids do not cause problems for the intestine. it appears however that gliadin is not completely broken-up by intestinal enzymes. several longer chains of amino acids remain intact. somehow these larger chains enter the cells lining the intestine perhaps because the cells are abnormally permeable (leaky) to longer chains of amino acids. some of these longer chains are toxic (damaging) to the intestinal cells. one of the longer chains attaches to an enzyme within the cells tissue transglutaminase. in individuals with celiac disease the complex of the longer chain of amino acids and tissue transglutaminase sets off an immune reaction that attacks the complex and at the same time damages the intestinal cells. barley and rye contain gliadin-like proteins and can cause celiac disease in genetically-predisposed individuals. oats also contain gliadin-like proteins but unlike barley and rye the gliadin-like proteins in oats cause inflammation weakly and in only a few individuals who are predisposed to develop celiac disease. rice and corn do not cause celiac disease because they do not contain gliadin-like proteins.,['celiac disease'],wmd

will an std show up on a stool culture,maybe. it depends on the culture. most stool cultures are for bacteria but some check for other organisms. certainly gonorrhea may be detected but perhaps not chlamydia. if you are concerned that you have been exposed to an std from anal sex you need to specifically ask to be std tested so the right tests can be performed. as noted in the previous answer a stool culture is usually done to detect other bacterial infections not stds. if there has been anal sex the testing should include a swab of the anal area but not a stool samplein some cases the presence of stool/feces leads to inaccurate results. when getting tested for stds you can request to be tested for oral and anal transmission in addition to regular testing of vagina/penis.,"['sexually transmitted disease', 'stool culture']",wmd

can i breastfeed while taking trileptal?,your question is an important one for women with epilepsy who wish to have a family. there is little scientific information on this subject and most of what we know if based on clinical experience of doctors taking care of women with epilepsy. the bottom line is that most physicians with expertise in managing epilepsy encourage their patients to breastfeed even if they are taking anti-seizure medicine. the baby has developed for nine months in the presence of the anti-seizure medicine and as such for the baby to continue to be exposed to it after delivery usually does not create problems. i am unaware of any [known] descriptions of problems with breastfeeding while on trileptal (oxcarbazepine). if blood levels are done in mom and her baby while breastfeeding the baby's level will be around half of the mother's. so the baby is definitely getting some of the drug but it usually does not create problems as best we tell. so if breastfeeding is important to you (as it is for most women) most experts in the field would encourage you to breastfeed.,['breastfeed'],wmd

what causes diarrhea?,"you are most likely to come down with diarrhea after coming into contact with these infectious organisms and agents: a virus such as rotavirus norwalk agent enterovirus or a hepatitis virus. a bacterium such as e. coli salmonella shigella clostridium or vibrio cholerae. a parasite such as those that cause giardiasis and amebiasis. you may pick up an infectious agent from contact with another individual who has it or you may get it after eating contaminated food or drinking contaminated water. if you eat food that was improperly cooked or was contaminated after cooking you may get food poisoning which can lead to diarrhea. children who attend day care and their families are more likely to be exposed to certain infectious agents. many people who travel to foreign countries develop what is termed ""traveler's diarrhea "" usually after drinking contaminated water. infectious diarrhea is a particular hazard in developing countries where it may be difficult to keep waste water and sewage separate from water used for cooking drinking and bathing and where inadequate facilities make it difficult to practice good personal hygiene. other medical conditions a number of noninfectious medical conditions may cause diarrhea too. these include: inability to digest certain foods including a lactose intolerance (difficulty digesting sugar found in dairy products); celiac disease (inability to digest wheat and sometimes other grains); and pancreatic problems such as those caused by cystic fibrosis which interfere with production of important digestive substances. surgery to remove part of your small intestine. a shortened small intestine may be unable to absorb all the substances you eat. this is referred to as short-bowel syndrome. surgery after removal of the gallbladder. an increase in bile in the colon may result in watery stools. certain diseases of the endocrine (hormonal) system including overactive thyroid disease diabetes adrenal disease and zollinger-ellison syndrome. certain rare tumors (including carcinoid tumor and pheochromocytoma) that produce diarrhea-causing substances (hormones). inflammation in the intestinal tract which can result in chronic diarrhea. if you have inflammatory bowel disease (such as ulcerative colitis or crohn's disease) you will have regular bouts of diarrhea during a flare-up of your disease. sometimes people who develop bumps in their intestine from diverticulitis also get diarrhea. irritable bowel syndrome which may cause alternating bouts of diarrhea and constipation. medications and other substances many medications can cause diarrhea. some of the most common include antacids containing magnesium laxatives digitalis diuretics a number of antibiotics chemotherapy drugs cholesterol-lowering agents lithium theophylline thyroid hormone and colchicine. radiation therapy for prostate cancer or cancers in the abdomen can damage the intestine and cause diarrhea. toxins such as insecticides psychedelic mushrooms and arsenic can cause diarrhea and overuse of caffeine or alcohol may contribute to diarrhea.",['diarrhea'],wmd

is there a way an olive skin person can have a chemical peel?,you know that is a good question. let me start off with this. the question of the medium complected person the olive skinned patient that has perhaps brown eyes what do we do for them because ive stated that they are not the perfect candidate. well there are people who kind of fall into youre probably okay type department. what we do there is rather than guess what the result would be we do what we call a patch test or a demo. we take a little bit of the chemical we put it on the skin of the forehead usually under where the hair would conceal it and we test the skin kind of like paint companies test paint put it out in the sun for a few months. were going to see how that skin behaves and were going to see what the end color is. now we may have to wait 3 to 6 months. it may take that long for the pink color to fade and for the skin to get to the ultimate color its going to be. most of the time itll be lighter but in some people it could be darker and wed like to know that. now its a color issue for these people. its not an issue of a greater chance of other serious complications like scarring or the white bumps its strictly the color. but that is important because people would like to have uniform color and natural look. but we also have to remind that patient that since most peoples skin will lighten up a little bit if they have a reasonable amount of pigment then theres a potential color difference between the treated face and the untreated neck. now that can be concealed with makeup and not necessarily heavy makeup but the patient needs to know that going in because there are some women for example who say but i dont ever wear makeup and i dont want to wear makeup and if im going to look like ive got a color difference then maybe this isnt for me and i agree it isnt for them. but if we can show them by the patch test the sample test the demo what the outcome will be then they can make a better decision. we still have to deal with the patient who has some darkness and increased darkness from sun damage and there are less intense ways to deal with even if a patient does develop pigmentation because perhaps they went out in the sun a little too soon or perhaps they went water skiing and washed off their sunscreen we do have bleach creams that are very effective within 4 to 6 weeks when applied once a day will bleach out that pigment. really? yeah not the extent of michael jackson bleach but to get us back to the baseline. yes we have some wonderful products that are available today all basically from good research.,"['skin', 'olive']",wmd

what increases the risk of getting parkinsons disease?,risk factors for parkinson's disease are difficult to identify because the cause of the disease is unknown. advancing age is the only known risk factor for typical parkinson's disease (not including early-onset parkinson's). most instances of parkinson's disease occur after age 50 although the illness does occur in people between the ages of 30 and 50 or in rare cases at a younger age. a very small number of people with parkinson's have a close relative who also has the disease but it does not appear that a family history of typical parkinson's disease significantly increases your risk of developing the disease. having a family history of the disease is a more significant risk factor in cases of early-onset parkinson's disease but this form of the disease is not common. some research suggests that long-term exposure to certain environmental factors such as pesticides chemicals or well water may increase a person's risk of developing parkinson's disease but this has not been proven. there are many other causes of parkinsonism which is a group of symptoms that includes tremor muscle stiffness slow movement and unsteady walking. parkinsonism mimics parkinson's disease but in fact is not parkinson's disease. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,"[""parkinson's disease""]",wmd

i have acne excoriee. i'd like to stop sqeezing my acne-what's the alternative-does a ripe white acne heal unpopped?,white filled acne will eventually heal itself unpopped but whatever you do don't pop acne that is not ripe or white as scarring will result. i used to have a similar problem with acne in middle and high school years and have been prescribed creams to medication but none truly worked. i then researched online and noticed a lot of acne comes from the food that you eat and deficiencies in zinc and vitamin a and c. i went to a local cvs and purchased zinc tablets which helps in reducing oil levels from a range of 35-100mg a day. be careful as overdose can occur with excessive amounts. i also began eating carrots and foods with vitamin c which can be googled. if scarring happens you should invest in apple cider vinegar and apply to a cotton ball and place on scar for a couple of minutes before the shower which helps removing old skin layers and making new ones. that has helped my scars tremendously after 1-2 months! then in the shower i recommend a body wash that has vitamin e in it for a good clean moisturizer which will help your skin as well. it all starts with the diet and cutting all the greasy oily food. fight your acne from the inside then out and you will see the results. hope this helps,"['acne', 'healing']",wmd

how should a senior who has had a stroke (cerebral infarction) alter his or her diet?,most strokes are due to a blood clot in the brain which is essentially the same thing that causes a heart attack. for this type of stroke we would recommend the same changes in the diet as those recommended to people with heart disease. if your cholesterol is high you need to take the necessary steps to lower it. that means decreasing your saturated fat intake (found mostly in meat and high-fat animal products like whole milk). you also want to decrease fat intake overall by cutting back on desserts butter creamy sauces etc. and losing weight when needed can play a large role in bringing your cholesterol down. many people who've suffered from a stroke need medication to get their cholesterol down and to prevent future strokes. but diet changes are still very important even for people taking medication. exercise can also help prevent another stroke but make sure to check with your doctor to find the right type of exercise for you.,[],wmd

how can i increase my chances of having a healthy baby with a pregnancy after age 35?,good health prior and during pregnancy will help you reduce your risk of complications. here are some general recommendations. be sure to get enough folic acid in your diet. the current recommendation for women of childbearing age is to take a daily supplement containing at least 0. 4 mg of folic acid in addition to consuming foods naturally rich in folic acid. folic acid is naturally contained in leafy green vegetables dried beans liver and some citrus fruits. limit your caffeine consumption. do not have more than 300 mg of caffeine per day. the caffeine content in various drinks depends on the beans or leaves used and how it is prepared. an 8-ounce cup of coffee has about 150 mg on average while black tea has about 80 mg of caffeine. a 12-ounce glass of caffeinated soda contains anywhere from 30 to 60 mg of caffeine. remember chocolate contains caffeine  the amount of caffeine in a chocolate bar is equal to 1/4 cup of coffee. maintain a healthy well-balanced diet and eat a variety of foods to get all the nutrients you need. choose foods high in starch and fiber. make sure you are getting enough vitamins and minerals in your daily diet. eat and drink at least four servings of dairy products and calcium-rich foods a day choose at least one source each of vitamin c vitamin a and folic acid every day. exercise regularly. review your exercise program with your health care provider. generally you may continue your normal exercise routine throughout pregnancy unless you are instructed to decrease or modify your activities. don't drink alcohol during pregnancy and don't use any medications unless recommended by your doctor. don't smoke during pregnancy. in addition be sure to obtain prenatal care especially early in your pregnancy. the first eight weeks are especially critical in your baby's development. early and regular prenatal care (health care during pregnancy) can increase your chances of having a healthy baby. regular appointments with your health care provider throughout your pregnancy are important to monitor your health and prevent or control any problems that develop during pregnancy. in addition to medical care prenatal care includes education on pregnancy and childbirth plus counseling and support.,"['pregnancy', 'baby']",wmd

what is melatonin?,its a hormone a synthetically produced hormone. most melatonin is not harvested from pineal glands. our body produces melatonin and most people dont realize this but we all already have enough melatonin in our systems. taking extra melatonin probably isnt going to do a whole heck of a lot unless youre melatonin deficient or unless youre taking it right at the right time in the cycle to help produce sleep. what is the best time to take melatonin? well thats a more complicated question than most people would imagine. so for example melatonin is only truly effective when you take it at particular times of the day and that timing has to be exactly opposite of your core body temperature drop. and so what ends up happening is you may end up you dont take melatonin like you would a sleeping pill where you take a sleeping pill and then get in the bed and fall asleep. melatonin doesnt really work that way. youd probably be taking it 2 – 3 hours ahead of the time youre about ready to go to bed and that should hit your cycle. everybodys cycle is different and so its kind of hard to tell. if youve already started to go down in terms of your core body temperature cycle and you take melatonin itll be completely ineffective which is why half of my patients tell me i tried melatonin and it didnt work and half my patients said i tried melatonin and it works great.,['melatonin'],wmd

what vegetables and fruits help fight cancer and heart disease?,celery green peppers thyme  and chamomile tea  all contain a phytochemical that research suggests has strong anti-inflammatory action. plant components (phytochemicals) appear to have the ability to protect us from harmful inflammation which can increase the risk of cancer heart disease and insulin resistance. additional clues about how plant compounds help prevent cancer and other disease have been revealed thanks to a series of studies from the western human nutrition research center in davis calif. the researchers are careful to point out that several key questions still need to be answered such as: are the compounds as effective in humans as they are in lab-cultured cells? what amounts of the phytochemicals do our bodies actually absorb and use from the foods we eat? the six plant compounds that the researchers specifically investigated (because they are thought to act as anti-inflammatory agents) are luteolin quercetin chrysin eriodicytol hesperetin and naringenin. here are a couple of the phytochemical discoveries:  the six phytochemicals studied were shown to inhibit a particular enzymes ability to activate a biochemical signal that leads to inflammation.  luteolin was the most effective inhibitor of the pro-inflammatory enzyme. luteolin can be found in celery thyme green peppers and chamomile tea. foods rich in quercetin include capers apples and onions. oranges grapefruit lemons and other citrus fruits are good sources of hesperetin eriodicytol and naringenin. consider this another good reason to add more fruits and vegetables to your everyday diet.,"['heart disease', 'cancer', 'fruit', 'vegetable']",wmd

how well do injectible fillers work on men?,weve had a good run with filling injections such as juvederm restylane perline artefill radiesse and recently sculptra which actually rather than offering immediate filling encourages the tissues under the skin surface to thicken and tighten. new collagen is formed. we have a large pool of experience with female patients. the ladies are happy with the results. of course people would like to have longer-lasting products with less risk and science continues to stay up all night in the laboratory working on that. botox and dysport have proven their value not only in the area of the horizontal forehead lines but the frown lines between the eyebrows and crows feet around the eyes. also a very hyperactive chin muscle that seems to quiver with every facial movement can be controlled with these medications which essentially lightly paralyze the nerves. how are men doing with it? well certainly there are fewer men who seek the services than women. one of the things weve learned is that particularly with botox and dysport it takes a larger dose to paralyze the muscle because mens muscles are thicker. another issue that must be dealt with is that bruising must be avoided since men do not have the option of applying makeup as women do. however when the techniques are done well there is very little chance of bruising. we always favor immediate application of ice as well as encourage patients to stop taking any medication such as aspirin so that there will be less chance of bruising. we are also currently investigating using arnica as a preventative just as we use it in face and neck lifting blepharoplasty and brow surgery.,[],wmd
is a pap smear or hpv test recommended for women?,your age may be one of the more important determinants in whether hpv testing is recommended. among younger women infections with hpv are very common. often a younger womans immune system is able to fight off an hpv infection. thus some type of pap smear may be the best choice for screening. by contrast if a women in her 30s or older has a positive test for high risk hpv it might be assumed that she has a more worrisome persisting infection. 90% of cervical cancers occur in unscreened or under-screened women (demay 2000). so you do need to get screenings but the type and interval of screening is going to depend upon your age and probably high risk hpv screening tests. liquid based paps do reduce the number of false negative results in the majority of women. ask your gyn if your pap will be a liquid type and if it will be reviewed by automated and human screeners. if you have one of the high risk hpv subtypes by dna testing request a copy of the results for your files so you will know which subtype you have. even if you have received a hpv vaccination you should will still need a pap smear. the recommended interval is still under discussion.,"['human papillomavirus', 'pap test']",wmd
can you use vicks vapor rub on a 4 month old,can you? yes. should you? probably not but that would be up to your child's pediatrician. there have been some studies that have shown a worsening of symptoms when vicks is used. it is not very effective in controlling any of these cold symptoms so you really don't need to subject your baby to this either rubbed on there chests (some grandmas even feel that putting on the feet will help! ) or in a hot vaporizer. i know that many of us were raised by a parent that used vicks and we survived but that does not mean it is 100% safe in infants. in my pediatric practice i discourage the use of vicks on a baby this young and ignore the dirty looks that i get from the grandmas when i inform them. for adults and older kids they can use it if they want.,[],wmd

is a vegan diet healthy for my 3 year old son?,with careful planning a vegan diet can meet the needs of your child. but you do have to be more vigilant about key nutrients such as iron zinc calcium vitamin d vitamin b12 and dha. because iron and zinc are not absorbed as well in plant foods include higher-than-recommended amounts. adding vitamin-c rich sources (strawberries tomatoes/tomato based products oranges kiwi and broccoli) to help absorb iron from fortified foods and plant sources. vegan children need a supplemental source of b12 (either fortified foods or supplements) because it only occurs naturally in animal foods. here are vegan foods sources for key nutrients that are important to stay on top of: vitamin b12: fortified nutritional yeast fortified cereals fortified soymilk meat analogues and supplements. iron: iron-fortified cereal beans tofu spinach raisins and enriched bread. zinc: cashews chickpeas oatmeal almonds beans and peas (be careful with nuts which are choking hazards) vitamin d: fortified foods (like soy milk) and supplements. the american academy of pediatrics recommends supplementation for children who don't get enough from diet. the recommended amount is 600iu. omega-3 dha: not naturally found in plant foods but can be found in some fortified foods and supplements. calcium: tofu made with calcium sulfate fortified soy milk/yogurt turnip greens kale fortified cereals a vegan diet is perfectly healthy for your son. you can get a complete diet based on the food pyramid if you are a vegan. here is how: grains - all natural forms of these products are vegan. if you buy processed foods you will need to check all the labels as some often contain animal products. be careful as some products use terminology that does not make it explicit that they are animal products. i recommend that you check an official vegan website for some of this terminology like sheffafoods veganfoods and many more you can do some online searches to find the relevant information. dairy: if you are a lacto vegan you can eat most dairy products. milk is not an animal so you might be okay with this. you will need b12 supplement if you are pure vegan; it is supplied in soy milk. drink it daily if you are pure vegan. if you ask me animal protein can't be replaced by anything else! so i would say that a vegan diet would not be a good idea especially for a 3-year child!,['diet'],wmd
how does krill oil help with fighting cancer,krill oil a rich source of omega 3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (dha) and eicosapentaenoic acid (epa) plays a key role in a healthy diet. according to the american cancer society there is some research that fish oils with these omega 3 fatty acids such as krill oil decrease the rate of cancer cell growth but not all studies agree. the most evidence for the benefits of fish oil is improving heart health including risk factors such as high triglycerides. always check with your healthcare provider about taking supplements during cancer treatment. for more on the benefits of krill oil see this webmd article ,['cancer'],wmd

if i use a foundation with sunscreen do i really need a separate sunscreen too?,it depends on what your skin type is how sensitive your skin is and how much sun exposure you are going to have. i love foundations that have sunscreens built into them. i think it's great to add sunscreen into any product you can to get that extra added protection. however i think it is important to use some protection underneath them. i don't think they give enough protection because to have that true spf 15 you would have to use enough product and typically that would be too thick a foundation to really give you enough protection. so i would use a moisturizer with sunscreen underneath and then a foundation with sunscreen in it right over it.,['sunscreen'],wmd

what are the symptoms of hepatitis c infection?,about 75% of people have no symptoms when they first acquire hepatitis c infection. the remaining 25% may complain of fatigue loss of appetite muscle aches or fever. yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice) is rare at this early stage of infection. over time the liver in people with chronic infection may begin to experience the effects of the persistent inflammation caused by the immune reaction to the virus. blood tests may show elevated levels of liver enzymes a sign of liver damage which is often the first suggestion that the infection may be present. patients may become easily fatigued or complain of nonspecific symptoms. as cirrhosis develops symptoms increase and may include : weakness. loss of appetite. weight loss. breast enlargement in men. a rash on the palms. difficulty with the clotting of blood. spider-like blood vessels on the skin. in patients with advanced cirrhosis the liver begins to fail. this is a life-threatening problem. confusion and even coma (encephalopathy) may result from the inability of the liver to process certain toxic substances. increased pressure in the blood vessels of the liver (portal hypertension) may cause fluid to build up in the abdominal cavity (ascites) and result in engorged veins in the swallowing tube (esophageal varices) that tear easily and can bleed suddenly and massively. portal hypertension also can cause kidney failure or an enlarged spleen resulting in a decrease of blood cells and the development of anemia increased risk of infection and bleeding. in advanced cirrhosis liver failure causes decreased production of clotting factors. patients with advanced cirrhosis often develop jaundice because the damaged liver is unable to eliminate a yellow compound called bilirubin that is formed from the hemoglobin of old red blood cells.,"['hepatitis c', 'infection']",wmd
what causes breast size difference and can it be corrected without surgery? 1 1/2 difference in cup size. i have had this problem since i was young. however it was not so dramatic. now after 2 children it has become nearly impossible to find a bra to accomodate such dramatic difference. i just want to know if there is anything i can do with out medical attn. the affects of the insecurity are affecting my intimate time with my husband as well as the way i dress and the amt of time spent outside of the home. i fear really bumping heads with depression of lack of self confidence.,there is really nothing non-surgical that can permanent fix asymmetrical breast sizes. sure you can use padding on the smaller side to fill the gap in the bra but that does not alter your self-image when that bra is removed. just about every female patient that i have had over the years who underwent a breast surgery for enlargement making them firmer after a few kids or even having a breast reduction are happy. prices vary on this cosmetic procedure but so do prices on used cars! you can spend $5000 (a guess since the price varies) on a boob-job or $5000 a used car. the breast job does not require gasoline insurance or much maintenance; and will last a lifetime. the car? it will eventually fall apart. you can get a car loan to buy it. you can get a boob loan to pay for surgery if this is important to you. you will likely be glad that you did and your husband. i don't think he will be complaining very much. i know that money can be tight but making a modest monthly payment to pay off your new breasts is really something i think most families can financially manage with a bit of planning. you had two children. your deserve it. many cosmetic surgeons have free consultations. make a few appointments and take your husband with you.,"['depression', 'breast', 'head', 'surgery', 'fear']",wmd

seven days since i missed my period. pregnancy tests negative. why?,if you have taken the urine pregnancy test after seven days of missed periods then the results are usually conclusive. you may repeat the test after 48 hours and if it is still negative then you are not pregnant. the delay can possibly be due to stress induced hormonal imbalance especially during this cycle due to stressors which can easily delay your menses. if your menses do not arrive naturally in next one week then you may opt for a withdrawal bleed with progesterone. a single delayed period is not an indication for infertility workup. repeat the tests and consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online  ,['missed period'],ic

what is genital herpes?,genital herpes is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases ( stds ). the disease can be bothersome. but if you are a healthy adult you do not need to worry that it will cause serious problems. most people never have symptoms or the symptoms are so mild that people do not know that they are infected. but in some people the disease causes occasional outbreaks of itchy and painful sores in the genital area. after the first outbreak the herpes virus stays in the nerve cells below the skin and becomes inactive. it usually becomes active again from time to time traveling back up to the skin and causing more sores. things like stress illness a new sex partner or menstruation may trigger a new outbreak. as time goes on the outbreaks happen less often heal faster and don't hurt as much. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,['genital herpes'],wmd

is it possible for a child to die from choking a day after it happen? is aspiration a sign of strangulation? . . child of 20 months old died from what looked to be strangulation but theryre not sure? is there something called aspiration or something else that would show false signs of strangulation? . why would a child have cold skin all the time developmental issues cry everytime they walked or stand have diarrhea every day for the past 5 months? what could cause death? why would the preliminary autopsy state strangulation but the final autopsy isn't here after 7 months? why?,i'm so sorry for your loss. even if it wasn't your child that's a very sad situation. it's really tough to know what all could have been wrong - even if they hadn't died by choking they could have gotten fluid in their lungs (aspiration) and that could have indeed caused death. i would want to know what they got into. if they cried when they walked or stood and had the other issues you were talking about there could have been some kind of profound birth defect that might have meant they weren't going to survive long anyway. could that be why the autopsy is taking so long? could they perhaps be trying to figure out what the problem was? unfortunately even autopsies don't always reveal what the issue was if it was neurological for example. i would want to know why they called it strangulation too. if the child was found clutching at their throat for example they might suspect choking on an object - but the child might have done that if they had been having trouble breathing too. keep in mind that 'strangulation' can have different meanings. it can mean they were strangled by someone or that they choked and strangled on something or it can mean that there was internal strangulation like with a hernia and a loop of bowel. you need better definitions before you will have an answer. once again you have my sympathy and i hope you can find some definitive answers.,"['choking', 'aspiration', 'coldness', 'skin', 'crying']",wmd
what cut of steak is good for entertaining?,have you ever stood before the meat department and wondered what to do? eye of round london broil new york flank filet mignon  they all stand before you and it can be overwhelming. my cousin celia called me today. she was having that what to do with the meat?  dilemma. she was getting ready for a friends birthday party (this friend loves a great steak) but wasnt sure which cut to pick for the crowd. if youre having a group of people and plan to serve filet mignon it can be a costly endeavor. my favorite cut of meat when entertaining and working on a budget is london broil. it is not a fatty cut. the thing you need to be careful about is cutting it correctly so its not chewy. when you are starting make sure to wait until the meat is room temperature — do not start cooking it right out of the refrigerator. if your meat is too cold when you start cooking it it will end up being dried out and chewy. i recommend using an oven or grill on high heat and dont cook the steak too long (i recommend medium rare to medium at the most). you can vary your presentation and flavors greatly. i also recommend that after you cook a piece of meat that is 1-2 pounds slice it thin. this way you end up eating a smaller portion of meat. you still get your boost of protein and iron — and not by overdoing it on a 20-ounce ribeye! you can rub a london broil piece down with cracked pepper kosher salt and extra virgin olive oil. throw it on the grill and then finish it with chopped fresh rosemary and some sautéed garlic. you can also serve the sliced beef on a bed of arugula and heirloom tomatoes that are drizzled with a bit of extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar. anyway you prepare it have fun with it and remember to keep your portion size in mind. a good visual for portion size is the size of your fist.,['cuts'],wmd
could smokeless tobacco be the cause of stomach upset and runny diahrrea? . my husband is a smokeless tobacco user. he has had some stomach issues along with diahrrea for which there is no medical answer.,let me start by saying that smokeless tobacco is no less dangerous in terms of causing cancer than cigarettes. i hope your husband realizes this. even if the stomach problems and diarrhea are new symptoms they could indeed be caused by smokeless tobacco usage. people who use smokeless tobacco and spit still swallow some of the saliva that contains harmful substances. that's why some of the cancers that arise from smokeless tobacco use can include cancers of the stomach pancreas and colon. of course smokeless tobacco use also can cause many types of oral cancers. if your husband's symptoms don't clear up on their own or if they're accompanied by fever pain or shortness of breath then he definitely should have them checked out by a medical professional. you can start with your primary health care provider. best wishes to you and your husband!,"['stomach', 'diarrhea']",wmd

do foods that have been pickled  like canned beets  still maintain their original nutritional value?,since there is generally no heat involved in the pickling process it doesnt significantly change the nutritional value of foods. this is particularly true if you start with raw veggies and keep the skin on since the skin often carries much of the nutritional value including the fiber. the fermentation process involved in pickling may even produce some health benefits since the healthy bacteria (probiotics) involved in the process can help keep your digestive system healthy. one possible nutritional downfall of pickling is the addition of salt which is key to the process. for that reason pickled beets and other vegetables are a good option to enjoy from time to time. but you dont want to make them your go-to sources of veggies.,[],wmd

i want to create an emergency kit for our family what should be in it and how often should i replace the items?,i think this is a great question. one of the things we learned after hurricane katrina is that a lot of people didn't have emergency kits available at home. some things i would definitely recommend include a bottle of hydrogen peroxide; to help clean out any type of wounds. maybe a triple antibiotic ointment to apply on the wounds after you have actually treated it band aids gauze pads rolled gauze so you can keep the gauze pad in place a flashlight extra batteries a weather radio. some type of fever reducer like tylenol or acetaminophen. maybe a motrin type of product as well. some imodium or pepto-bismol is another item that you may want to include in there along with some plastic latex gloves just in case something happens and you need to protect yourself. those are some of the common items that are found in the emergency kits that are available on the stores today. i would definitely recommend checking the expiration dates. once a year you should always go through that emergency kit as well as your medicine cabinet and check the expiration dates; if anything has expired you want to make sure that you dispose of it properly. in this case we want to make sure that people use the correct method. you want to get a ziploc bag and you want to take the medications and put it into the ziploc bag. you want to take a little bit of water and you want to help it dissolve or you can crush it with like a pot or a hammer. then you want to take something that will make it not very appealing like kitty litter or coffee grinds. put that into the ziploc bag seal it up and put it in the trash. that's the best way. we don't want people to flush medications anymore this is the preferred way now to dispose of medications. but that's a good rule of thumb each year to do.,"['multivitamin', 'family']",wmd

what are some of the symptoms of pregnancy?,one of the first pregnancy symptoms you may notice is that your period does not arrive. while this symptom is one we most commonly associate with pregnancy there may be other reasons why a period hasnt arrived for example high levels of stress major illness or surgery. another well known pregnancy symptom is morning sickness. morning sickness can pay you a visit any time of day so make sure you eat enough and avoid letting your blood sugar levels drop. ginger is a great natural remedy for nausea so its worth a try although some women find that nothing seems to help their morning sickness which normally hangs around for the first trimester before getting better or if you are unlucky the second trimester or even whole pregnancy. for more details click on early pregnancy symptoms,['pregnancy'],wmd

vitamin d level was 15? my doctor prescribed 50 000 iu every other day. details are below. so my vitamin d level was 15 last year i did nothing about it unfortunately but i was. -always sleepy. - i would take long naps during the day. -i can't concentrate. - anxious. -knee pain once in a while it starts hurting and feeling really stiff goes away with rest. i feel bad because i'm in college and i don't have time for this i have lots of work to do. do you guys think this is because of my vitamin d levels? also what other tests should i do to determine the cause? thanks a lot.,"i don't know what you mean by you ""don't have time for this. "" curing a vitamin d deficiency is as easy as taking a pill once a day. low vitamin d levels have been associated with bone pain general muscle weakness and even cancer (thought that's unlikely in a young person). it's doubtful your sleepiness and lack of concentration are due to vitamin d deficiency but i suppose anything's possible. you don't need any ""other test"" to determine the cause of your low vitamin d levels. it's pretty simple: you're not consuming enough vitamin d and you're not getting enough sunlight on your skin. this is a very common problem. on the one hand we medical professionals tell people to wear sunscreen. on the other hand we tell them they're deficient in vitamin d. the solution is to continue wearing sunscreen when you go in the sun for prolonged periods of time and to take vitamin d supplements. if you have no personal or family history of skin cancer you probably are safe to get 15-30 minutes of sun per day on your skin. this will help boost your vitamin d levels. given how very deficient you are in vitamin d i hope you took the prescribed 50 000 iu of vitamin d every other day until the prescription was gone. the usual length of therapy is a couple of weeks. you should get re-tested if you have not already done so. and then you may need to continue taking inexpensive vitamin d supplements for awhile until your levels are within normal range. please note you should not continue taking 50 000 iu of vitamin d indefinitely. that's a very large dose. if you have any questions consult your health care provider. wishing you well! i don't believe the answer is always so cut and dry. my vitmain d level has been low and getting lower for at least 5 years now. i don't tolerate the heat or sunshine so i don't get very much sun. but i have been pushing myself to tolerate it. but i've been on several very high courses of good quality vitamin d supplements and the mainstays of my diet are all vitamin d rich. but there was never even a slight rise in my levels. at last check my levels were in the single digits. incidentally i am always tired and always in pain these days. absolutely! i have had similar symptoms along with cardiac and autoimmune disorders. my vitamin d level is 13 and has runned low for years. i too never worried about vitamin d but i've found out that it's a huge problem and runs in my family related to synthesis problems of vitamins and enzymes. have levels check regularly even after normal labs and please take your vitamin d with lots of sunshine and diet rich in vitamin d c b12 calcium etc. i've gotten much better! they all work together. what i meant is i don't have time to feel so down with all my responsibilities i did start taking the pill recently. i was asking what other tests can i do to determine the cause of feeling sleepy all the time and having concentration issues and if it's somehow related to my vitamin d insufficiency. nonetheless thank you for putting time and answering. greatly appreciate all the answers.","['sleepiness', 'concentration', 'pain']",wmd

how is epilepsy treated?,the most common way to treat epilepsy is with medication. specific drugs are prescribed depending on the type of epilepsy or seizure a person has. when medication doesn't work surgery is another treatment option. in some cases a surgeon can remove the area of the brain producing seizures or can interrupt the nerve pathways that signal seizures. for children a very strict meal plan called the ketogenic diet may reduce seizures. if a patient doesn't respond to medication and surgery is not an option vagus nerve stimulation can help prevent seizures. it works through a battery implant in the chest that delivers small pulses of electrical energy into the brain via the vagus nerve in the neck. the downside: it doesn't work for everyone and it is not approved by the fda for kids younger than age 12.,['epilepsy'],wmd

what are psoriatic arthritis symptoms and signs?,"in most patients the psoriasis precedes the arthritis by months to years. the arthritis frequently involves the knees ankles and joints in the feet. usually only a few joints are inflamed at a time. the inflamed joints become painful swollen hot and red. sometimes joint inflammation in the fingers or toes can cause swelling of the entire digit giving them the appearance of a ""sausage. "" joint stiffness is common and is typically worse early in the morning. less commonly psoriatic arthritis may involve many joints of the body in a symmetrical fashion mimicking the pattern seen in rheumatoid arthritis. psoriatic arthritis can also cause inflammation of the spine (spondylitis) and the sacrum causing pain and stiffness in the low back buttocks neck and upper back. in rare instances psoriatic arthritis involves the small joints at the ends of the fingers. a very destructive form of arthritis called ""mutilans"" can cause rapid damage to the joints. fortunately this form of arthritis is rare in patients with psoriatic arthritis. patients with psoriatic arthritis can also develop inflammation of the tendons (tendinitis) and around cartilage. inflammation of the tendon behind the heel causes achilles tendinitis leading to pain with walking and climbing stairs. inflammation of the chest wall and of the cartilage that links the ribs to the breastbone (sternum) can cause chest pain as seen in costochondritis. aside from arthritis and spondylitis psoriatic arthritis can cause inflammation in other organs such as the eyes lungs and aorta. inflammation in the colored portion of the eye (iris) causes iritis a painful condition that can be aggravated by bright light as the iris opens and closes the opening of the pupil. corticosteroids injected directly into the eyes are sometimes necessary to decrease inflammation and prevent blindness. inflammation in and around the lungs (pleuritis) causes chest pain especially with deep breathing as well as shortness of breath. inflammation of the aorta (aortitis) can cause leakage of the aortic valve valves leading to heart failure and shortness of breath. acne and nail changes are commonly seen in psoriatic arthritis. pitting and ridges are seen in fingernails and toenails of 80% of patients with psoriatic arthritis. interestingly these characteristic nail changes are observed in only a minority of psoriasis patients who do not have arthritis. acne has been noted to occur in higher frequency in patients with psoriatic arthritis. in fact a new syndrome has been described characterized by inflammation of the joint lining (synovitis) acne and pustules on the feet or palms thickened and inflamed bone (hyperostosis) and bone inflammation (osteitis). this syndrome is therefore given the eponym sapho syndrome.",['psoriatic arthritis'],wmd

is surgery the only way to get rid of stretch marks?,stretch marks occur from disruption in the underlying dermal support of the skin. topical medications that contain tretinoin are designed to increase cell turnover and encourage new collagen deposition. lasers work by targeting and subsequently tightening the dermis and encouraging new cell growth. a combination of topical products and lasers may improve less severe stretch marks. but more severe stretch marks are less likely to respond to nonsurgical approaches. stretch marks are weaknesses in the supporting structure of the skin causing layers of the skin (dermis) to separate and leaving the skin grooved and discolored. stretch marks develop when the skin is excessively stretched during pregnancy weight gain or growth spurts. they are most common during pregnancy and the teen years when growth spurts and increased levels of steroid hormones cause significant changes throughout the body. stretch marks can also be brought on by obesity. genetic factors including inherited defects of connective tissues also play a role. prevention is the key. to avoid stretch marks avoid rapid weight gain or loss. moisturize daily when pregnant. there is no exact cure for stretch marks; however products containing glycolic acids tretinoin or vitamin c help towards rebuilding the structure of your skin. for a more invasive option consider laser resurfacing. lasers work by stimulating collagen synthesis. for severe stretch marks you may want to consider evaluation by a plastic surgeon for surgical removal.,[],wmd

what are some healthy ways to help me manage my stress levels?,1. spend time in nature. sun exposure and natural light have been found to increase your mood. take a break during the day and be sure to step outside or go near a window to get your dose of mood-enhancing light. pay attention to the colors in nature when youre outdoors. what sounds do you hear? looking around your environment with a fresh pair of eyes can be a very relaxing experience. 2. move your body. the current recommendations for physical activity call for sixty minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise daily. sound daunting? make it fun! go for a walk as a family turn on the radio and dance or practice yoga balance poses. movement activities positively affect health by reducing blood pressure enhancing mood and strengthening bones. 3. laugh. laughter really is the best medicine. take a moment to remember a situation that you found humorous. as you vividly recall the details youll probably find that a smile spontaneously develops. tell jokes make funny faces or start laughing and see who laughs with you. it can be contagious! 4. express yourself creatively. expressive art therapy enables you to share inner thoughts or feelings when they are difficult to articulate verbally. engaging in art activities such as finger painting drawing coloring etc. may relieve feelings of anxiety. 5. listen to music. there are many benefits to listening to music from relaxation to enhancing sleep. 6. take a warm bath. there are many historical references to the healing properties of water. ancient spas originated near mineral springs and seas and were used by natural healers to support health. establishing a bedtime routine that includes a warm bath in a quiet room can help to promote sleep and feelings of calm after a long day. run a warm bath light a few candles and close the door to spend some quality time with you. 7. aromatherapy. this refers to the use of essential oils to improve health and wellbeing. oils are delivered to the body through inhalation or direct application to the skin. lavender lemon balm and sandalwood are the two most common oils used to promote relaxation and reduce anxiety. add a few drops to bath water or on a pillowcase. rub the oils between the palms of your hands and cup your hands to inhale a few deep breaths of the scent. use with caution if you have asthma or a skin condition associated with allergies. consult a physician before use. 8. gratitude journal. when were faced with lifes challenges we often see only the stressful situation and lose sight of all that we have to be thankful for in our lives. the next time life seems to hand you lemons try making lemonade by writing down ten things you appreciate in your life. it wont eliminate the stress but you may find that it helps to improve your mood and shift your perspective allowing you to see new possibilities to resolve stressful situations. 9. gentle massage. human touch is very powerful and can be quite nurturing. use a lotion or light massage oil to rub the feet and/or hands. there are numerous points on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet that may influence various systems within the body. a gentle massage can be both relaxing and stimulating. use this technique to help quell stress when it appears. 10. mindful breathing. the mind has a tendency to wander. our thoughts pull us into the past replaying moments that we cant recover or push us into the future as we worry about what has yet to come. the body is always in the present moment. noticing your breathing on purpose without feeling the need to change it brings us back to the present moment. it serves as an anchor. take a time-out to notice your breathing when you feel stressed or worried and pay attention to how your body feels.,[],wmd

what's the best way to manage acid reflux also known as gerd?,there are several ways to approach the evaluation and management of acid reflux also called gerd. the approach depends primarily on the frequency and severity of symptoms the adequacy of the response to treatment and the presence of complications. for infrequent heartburn the most common symptom of gerd lifestyle changes and an occasional antacid may be all that is necessary. if heartburn is frequent daily nonprescription-strength (over-the-counter) h2 antagonists may be necessary. a foam barrier also can be used with the antacid or h2 antagonist. if lifestyle changes and antacids nonprescription h2 antagonists and a foam barrier do not adequately relieve heartburn it is time to see a physician for further evaluation and to consider prescription-strength drugs. the evaluation by the physician should include an assessment for possible complications of gerd based on the presence of such symptoms or findings as: cough. asthma. hoarseness. sore throat. difficulty swallowing. unexplained lung infections. anemia (due to bleeding from esophageal inflammation or ulceration). clues to the presence of diseases that may mimic gerd such as gastric or duodenal ulcers and esophageal motility disorders should be sought. if there are no symptoms or signs of complications and no suspicion of other diseases a therapeutic trial of acid suppression with h2 antagonists often is used. if h2 antagonists are not adequately effective a second trial with the more potent ppis can be given. if treatment relieves the symptoms completely no further evaluation may be necessary and the effective drug the h2 antagonist or ppi is continued. if at the time of evaluation there are symptoms or signs that suggest complicated gerd or a disease other than gerd or if the relief of symptoms with h2 antagonists or ppis is not satisfactory a further evaluation by endoscopy (egd) definitely should be done. there are several possible results of endoscopy and each requires a different approach to treatment. if the esophagus is normal and no other diseases are found the goal of treatment simply is to relieve symptoms. if damage to the esophagus (esophagitis or ulceration) is found the goal of treatment is healing the damage. if complications of gerd such as stricture or barrett's esophagus are found treatment with ppis also is more appropriate. however the adequacy of the ppi treatment probably should be evaluated with a 24-hour ph study during treatment with the ppi. strictures may also need to be treated by endoscopic dilatation (widening) of the esophageal narrowing. if symptoms of gerd do not respond to maximum doses of ppi there are two options for management. the first is to perform 24-hour ph testing to determine whether the ppi is ineffective or if a disease other than gerd is likely to be present. if the ppi is ineffective a higher dose of ppi may be tried. the second option is to go ahead without 24-hour ph testing and to increase the dose of ppi. another alternative is to add another drug to the ppi that works in a way that is different from the ppi for example a promotility drug or a foam barrier. if necessary all three types of drugs can be used. if there is not a satisfactory response to this maximal treatment 24 hour ph testing should be done. patients should consider surgery if they have regurgitation that cannot be controlled with drugs. this recommendation is particularly important if the regurgitation results in infections in the lungs or occurs at night when aspiration into the lungs is more likely. patients also should consider surgery if they require large doses of ppis or multiple drugs to control their reflux. some physicians  primarily surgeons  recommend that all patients with barrett's esophagus should have surgery. this recommendation is based on the belief that surgery is more effective than treatment with drugs in preventing both the reflux and the cancerous changes in the esophagus. there are no studies however demonstrating the superiority of surgery over drugs for the treatment of gerd and its complications.,"['heartburn', 'reflux']",wmd

what are some of the best over-the-counter solutions for diaper rash?,diaper rash is a common problem and i can tell you that there are a few things that parents can do to help prevent it and then there is also ways to treat it. preventing it what you want to do is make sure you change the baby frequently. you don't want them to sit in a white wet diaper all the day long and by actually cleaning the area very well and letting it air dry little bit before you put on the next diaper. you want to carry things in your house as far as wipes to make sure you clean the area throughly and use things something like desitin ointment which is a zinc oxide base. it actually will create a water-tight barrier that will help prevent moisture from staying on the skin. there is also boudreaux's butt paste which is another popular product just as good as desitin has the same active ingredient in it. if you notice though that the rash is becoming a little bit more inflamed and red seems to be spreading baby is running a fever then you want to have it checked out by your pediatrician. because they may actually need prescription medication because it could have became a little more fungal. speaking of fungal the one thing that i think a lot of parents do is put cornstarch on a baby when they are doing the diaper change and that is actually not something that you want to do. it actually help trap in fungus. so don't use any powder at all.,"['diaper rash', 'over the counter']",wmd

what types of ringworm are there? what are ringworm symptoms and signs?,"the following are the different types of ringworm or tinea: tinea barbae: ringworm of the bearded area of the face and neck with swelling and marked crusting is often accompanied by itching sometimes causing the hair to break off. in the days when men went to the barber daily for a shave tinea barbae was called barber's itch. tinea capitis: ringworm of the scalp commonly affects children mostly in late childhood or adolescence. this condition may spread in schools. tinea capitis appears as scalp scaling that is associated with bald spots (in contrast to seborrhea or dandruff for instance which do not cause hair loss). tinea corporis: when fungus affects the skin of the body it often produces the round spots of classic ringworm. sometimes these spots have an ""active"" outer border as they slowly grow and advance. it is important to distinguish this rash from other even more common rashes such as nummular eczema. this condition and others may appear similar to ringworm but they are not due to a fungal infection and require different treatment. tinea cruris: tinea of the groin (""jock itch"") tends to have a reddish-brown color and extends from the folds of the groin down onto one or both thighs. other conditions that can mimic tinea cruris include yeast infections psoriasis and intertrigo a chafing rash which results from the skin rubbing against the skin. tinea faciei (faciale): ringworm on the face except in the area of the beard. on the face ringworm is rarely ring shaped. characteristically it causes red scaly patches with indistinct edges. tinea manus: ringworm involving the hands particularly the palms and the spaces between the fingers. it typically causes thickening (hyperkeratosis) of these areas often on only one hand. tinea manus is a common companion of tinea pedis (ringworm of the feet). it is also called tinea manuum. tinea pedis: athlete's foot may cause scaling and inflammation in the toe webs especially the one between the fourth and fifth toes. another common form of tinea pedis produces a thickening or scaling of the skin on the heels and soles. this is sometimes referred to as the ""moccasin distribution. "" in still other cases tinea causes blisters between the toes or on the sole. aside from athlete's foot tinea pedis is known as tinea of the foot or more loosely fungal infection of the feet. tinea pedis is an extremely common skin disorder. it is the most common and perhaps the most persistent of the fungal (tinea) infections. it is rare before adolescence. it may occur in association with other fungal skin infections such as tinea cruris (jock itch). tinea unguium: finally fungal infection can make the fingernails and more often the toenails yellow thick and crumbly. this is referred to as fungal nails or onychomycosis.",['ringworm'],wmd

what causes the creases around my smile?,the nasolabial creases also known as the parentheses because their shape mimics parentheses are the curve-like grooves that begin where the nose meets the cheeks and typically end below the corners of the mouth. sometimes the muscle action in smiling can accentuate them. how do we get these? the answer is simple one word: aging. as we age nature spontaneously shrinks the fat layer in the face. the first area for the shrinkage to show is around the mouth because in fact it is the area where nature originally deposited the thinnest layer of fat. so as the fat diminishes the nasolabial groove becomes more prominent. expect this to begin even in the 40s. the good news is that we now have many products that can fill the grooves and make them look better. and by the way that is a far better answer than any mid-face or surgical facelift that claims to be able to pull out the nasolabial crease. that wont happen satisfactorily. what will happen is youll have that over-tight over-pulled look. weve all seen some unfortunate people who made a bad decision by having the procedure done and they look like the joker in the batman movie. its a bad look and it cannot be easily reversed. artefill is a long-lasting non-resorbable filler that works because within it are little spheres of purified collagen. the collagen acts as a base upon which the body can increase its own collage production and therefore fill the groove. not everyone is familiar with artefill. over 20 000 patients have been treated with it since the launch of the product nearly three years ago. the manufacturer states there have been no product recalls.  artefill is not the only substance that fills the nasolabial crease but it should be considered because of its long presence in the tissue. as you know some of the fillers last four to six months. as with all fillers when done by a skilled injector whether it be an md or an rn its very difficult to tell that the filler material has been injected. it looks natural and feels natural.,[],wmd

how can i help research on epilepsy?,there are many ways that people with epilepsy and their families can help with research on this disorder. pregnant women with epilepsy who are taking antiepileptic drugs can help researchers learn how these drugs affect unborn children by participating in the antiepileptic drug pregnancy registry which is maintained by the genetics and teratology unit of massachusetts general hospital (see section on pregnancy and motherhood). people with epilepsy that may be hereditary can aid research by participating in the epilepsy gene discovery project which is supported by the epilepsy foundation. this project helps to educate people with epilepsy about new genetic research on the disorder and enlists families with hereditary epilepsy for participation in gene research. people who enroll in this project are asked to create a family tree showing which people in their family have or have had epilepsy. researchers then examine this information to determine if the epilepsy is in fact hereditary and they may invite participants to enroll in genetic research studies. in many cases identifying the gene defect responsible for epilepsy in an individual family leads researchers to new clues about how epilepsy develops. it also can provide opportunities for early diagnosis and genetic screening of individuals in the family. people with epilepsy can help researchers test new medications surgical techniques and other treatments by enrolling in clinical trials. information on clinical trials can be obtained from the ninds as well as many private pharmaceutical and biotech companies universities and other organizations. a person who wishes to participate in a clinical trial must ask his or her regular physician to refer him or her to the doctor in charge of that trial and to forward all necessary medical records. while experimental therapies may benefit those who participate in clinical trials patients and their families should remember that all clinical trials also involve some risks. therapies being tested in clinical trials may not work and in some cases doctors may not yet be sure that the therapies are safe. patients should be certain they understand the risks before agreeing to participate in a clinical trial. patients and their families also can help epilepsy research by donating their brain to a brain bank after death. brain banks supply researchers with tissue they can use to study epilepsy and other disorders.,['epilepsy'],wmd

what the relationship between teens' sleep and eating habits?,impportant news for parents of teens: the latest headlines in the sleep literature say teens who sleep less eat more. and they arent reaching for fruits and veggies. its not news to scientists whove found that people who sleep fewer than the hours their bodies need have a stronger craving for fatty foods and snacks. all of which can send a roaring teen metabolism on vacation and open the door to weight gain and obesity. but this latest study went a bit further to show a relationship between sleep duration and snacking a favorite food activity for teens:  for each one-hour increase in sleep duration the odds of consuming a high amount of calories from snacks decreased by an average of 21 percent.  a significantly greater proportion of teens who slept less than 8 hours per weeknight consumed food in the early morning between 5 a. m. and 7 a. m.  specifically the researchers found that — after adjusting for factors like age sex and race — teens who slept less than 8 hours on weeknights consumed 2. 2 percent more calories from fats and 3. 0 percent fewer calories from carbs than teens who slept 8 hours or more. news like this doesnt bode well for the future of our children given the fact sleep is last on their list of things to do. whats more 2. 2 percent more calories from fats may not seem like a lot but when you add it all up over time it can amount to a weighty number. the challenge: teaching our children to establish good sleep habits knowing that this may be part of the struggle we have in teaching healthy eating habits! unknowingly teens may be establishing a vicious cycle where their food choices are driven by their sleep choices. teenagers are likely to be saddled with body-image issues. an unbalanced diet in adolescence especially one with high fat content has both short- and long-term health consequences. if a lack of sleep is behind these eating habits try a conversation about sleep diet and health. how much of a sacrifice would it take for them to get to bed earlier? todays teens have many responsibilities heavy academic loads extracurricular activities and the typical teen social attractions and distractions all of which often make their list of priorities ahead of sleep maybe you can compromise on a reasonable bedtime try it out for a week and adjust it later. the good news is that the importance of sleep might motivate them to make a change — much more so than insisting that they eat their broccoli and take their vitamins. if they knew that a solid start to a healthy body is just a good nights sleep away  well you never know. it just might be the ticket to a healthier and maybe happier teenager. and a healthy happy household.,[],wmd

im 314lbs and trying to lose weight. i cant excercise 2 min before im gasping for air. how can i get a work out in?,first congratulations on taking this important first step in reducing your weight to a healthy level! i salute you. second be sure you've received the ok from your health care provider to undertake a diet and exercise program. if your doctor has cleared you to exercise then your shortness of breath may be normal simply due to your current size. don't let this discourage you. it may not be realistic for you to expect to perform say 20 minutes of aerobic activity at this point. that time will come. right now 2 minutes might actually be more realistic for you. i'd suggest you start with simply walking. if you can manage to walk for 2 minutes 10 times a day there's your 20 minutes. do that every day and you'll gradually build up stamina. if you've been watching one of those television shows where 300+ pound people engage in vigorous workouts and lose dramatic amounts of weight quickly i'd suggest you stop watching. in my opinion those programs do not depict a realistic vision of exercise for people who weigh over 300 pounds. the workouts shown on those programs are closely monitored by an entire medical team and can be dangerous for the average unsupervised exerciser. again i can't stress how much i admire you for your determination. try checking out webmd's diet community for support and access to experts who can help you on your journey. be patient. it may take you quite some time to lose all the weight you want to lose. remember to set intermediate goals and rewards along the way to stay motivated. best wishes to you! dont give up! although you may not be able to exercise for long now you should expect to see less shortness of breath and better cardiovascular endurance the longer you stay consistent with your exercise routine. be sure that youre not trying to do too much with your exercise. it may be best to start out with a low intensity level of exercise and expanding upon it as tolerated. it may not seem like a lot at first but you can slowly and gradually build up the duration and intensity of your exercise the more that you are able to adhere to it. remember your exercise doesnt have to be done all in one session. divide it up and takes breaks to rest and recover if you need to and then pick it back up later. you may be able to continually shorten the amount of rest that you take in between sessions to eventually spend more time in a single session. also try building in more opportunities to incorporate more physically activity within your daily routine. try taking the stairs instead of the elevator or park further away. making a habit out of incorporating small opportunities like these can ultimately lead to becoming better conditioned for exercise. if exercise remains to be too difficult id still encourage you to continue to do what you can but id suggest placing more of an emphasis on your nutrition to lose enough weight until youre at the point that you can exercise more comfortably. keep up the great work! remember to always consult your doctor before beginning an exercise routine or weight loss plan. please keep one thing in mind. you did not gain the weight over a few months so don't expect it to magically fall off in a few months; there are no shortcuts just dedication and the will power you will need to get your butt off the couch and head outside (or treadmill) and walk everyday. at first just do what you can but make a training schedule and follow it - you are accountable to no one but yourself so don't let yourself down! i will not do you any favors by lying to you or telling you loosing weight is easy. as you know it is not. it is a long hard journey to loose the weight but if your mindset is right and your willpower is strong (do it for no one but yourself). then you are on your way to a successful weight loss journey! good luck! btw. before putting something in your mouth ask yourself if you are really hungry if you are not - ask yourself why you are eating. congrats on this big step in life! you can do it! however to safely do it i would go to your local ymca and have a professional check you out( your heart rate ect. ) they will put you on a plan that fits you!,['exercise'],wmd

what conditions mimic food allergy?,there are many conditions that can mimic food allergy. the possibilities include not only food allergy but also any other diseases that have symptoms brought on by food. these include reactions to certain chemicals in food for example histamine or food additives food poisoning several other gastrointestinal diseases and psychological symptoms. histamine toxicity: some natural substances (for example histamine) in foods can cause reactions resembling allergy. histamine can reach high levels in cheese some wines and certain fish particularly tuna and mackerel. in fish the histamine is believed to stem from bacterial contamination especially in fish that has not been refrigerated properly. histamine toxicity has been referred to as pseudoallergic fish poisoning and accounts for over one-third of seafood-related food-borne illnesses according to the u. s. centers for disease control and prevention (cdc). food additives: another type of food intolerance is an adverse reaction to certain compounds that are added to food to enhance taste provide color or protect against the growth of microorganisms. consumption of large amounts of these additives can produce symptoms that mimic the entire range of allergic symptoms. the compounds most frequently tied to adverse reactions that can be confused with food allergy are yellow dye number 5 monosodium glutamate (msg) and sulfites. yellow dye number 5 can cause hives although rarely. sulfites occur naturally in some foods and wines and are added to others to enhance crispness or prevent the growth of mold. in high concentrations sulfites can pose problems for people with severe asthma. food poisoning: eating food that is contaminated with microorganisms such as bacteria and their products such as toxins is the usual cause of food poisoning. thus the ingestion of contaminated eggs salad milk or meat can produce symptoms that mimic food allergy. common microbes that can cause food poisoning include the noroviruses campylobacter jejuni salmonella listeria monocytogenes vibrio vulnificus and e. coli 0157:h7. lactase deficiency (lactose intolerance): another cause of food intolerance which often is confused with a food allergy specifically to milk is lactase deficiency. this common food intolerance affects at least one out of 10 people. lactase is an enzyme in the lining of the small intestine. this enzyme digests or breaks down lactose a complex sugar in milk to simple sugars which are then absorbed into the blood. if a person has lactase deficiency he does not have enough lactase to digest the lactose in most milk products. instead other bacteria in the intestine use the undigested lactose thereby producing gas. symptoms of lactose intolerance include bloating abdominal pain and diarrhea. gluten-sensitive enteropathy: intolerance to gluten occurs in a disease called gluten-sensitive enteropathy or celiac sprue. gluten-sensitive enteropathy is caused by a unique abnormal immune response to certain components of gluten which is a constituent of the cereal grains wheat rye and barley. although sometimes referred to as an allergy to gluten this immune response involves a branch of the immune system that is different from the one involved in a classical food allergy. other gastrointestinal diseases: several other gastrointestinal diseases produce abdominal symptoms (especially nausea vomiting diarrhea and pain) that are sometimes caused by food. these diseases therefore can resemble food allergies. examples include peptic ulcer gallstones non-ulcer dyspepsia (which is a type of indigestion) crohn's disease (regional enteritis) cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and a rare condition called eosinophilic gastroenteritis. psychological: some people have a food intolerance that has a psychological origin. in these people a careful psychiatric evaluation may identify a traumatic event in that person's life often during childhood tied to eating a particular food.,['food allergy'],wmd

how to remove pimples and the scars on my face?,pimple is somewhat hormonal and due to oily skin. remember the following measures to control pimples. do not use hair oil and avoid oily foods chocolates and milk products. do not use any steroid creams. face wash and soaps are not the treatment and they do not help. do not touch the acne and avoid pressing it. regarding treatment of pimple i suggest clindamycin (clintop faceclin or clear gel). this is more of preventive and curative so i tell patients to use it all over face in the morning and use adapalene gel (adapalene or differin) over acne in the night. i also suggest you to take tablet doxy (doxycycline) 100 mg once in a day. consult your doctor discuss with him/her and take the medicine with consent. if you have acne marks avoid direct sunlight exposure as much as you can. wear sunglass cap and cover exposed part of your body all the time use sunscreen thrice in a day such as 10 am 12 pm and 3 pm. it has to be applied all over the face. sunscreen spf (sun protection factor) should be around 50. use anti-pigmentation cream over pigmented parts like kojic acid hydroquinone depiwhite cream etc. in the night. ideal treatment is glycolic acid peels. sittings of six to eight peels must be required. post acne scars are three types. box scar ice-pick (pinpoint scars) and rolling scars. pinpoint scars are difficult to treat while box scars are easy. no cream or tablet can help you out in scars. best technique is co2 fractional laser and subscision. it takes five to six sitting but results are better than any other procedure. dermaroller and subscision are also other methods but less effective than the above. fillers do have hiding effect. it fills the pits and gives impression of fullness and it is not permanent. if scars are not much prominent then peels also could be effective. these are technique you can go through. all procedures take four to five sitting and five to six months for better results. for further information consult a dermatologist online  ,['acne scars'],ic

will the new health-care law cause a shortage of doctors if more people are insured? what is in place to help that?,the fact is that with or without health-care reform we're facing a doctor shortage in this country. the association of medical colleges anticipates a 21 000 shortage of primary-care doctors – the medical professionals who play perhaps the most central and critical role in the success of reform  by 2015. with an additional 32 million americans expected to gain access to health insurance that trend along with other factors contributing to the shortage is only expected to grow. affordable care act and jobs so what's being done? the law outlines a number of programs to support the development of 16 000 new primary-care health providers over the next five years just as a start. some of those efforts include:  creating additional spots in primary-care residency programs.  increasing the number of trained nurse practitioners who are central to the delivery of primary care.  providing funds to train additional physician assistants who practice medicine under the supervision of a physician.  providing grants to states to create innovative programs to grow their primary-care work force.  scholarships and loan repayment programs for doctors (who often graduate medical school saddled with debt).  promoting medical residency (training) programs in rural and other underserved areas and offering tax benefits to medical professionals who work in underserved areas. shifting our approach beefing up our medical work force is critical but it's not likely to be enough to meet the coming demand. as a result the law also calls for a shift in the way health care is practiced. for example there are a number of pilot projects that will test new medical practice models aimed at helping doctors and nurses better manage the care of people with chronic health conditions. these projects will emphasize a team approach in primary-care settings as well as ongoing relationships between patients and primary-care providers. stronger coordination among primary and specialty care and greater participation on the part of the patient and his or her family will also be encouraged. putting money on the line encouragement won't come in the form of a pep talk and a pat on the back; the goal is to financially reward providers for keeping people healthy. that's a switch from the system that predominates today  a fee-for-service model  in which doctors are paid only when they provide a service. that encourages more services not necessarily better or more appropriate care. under reform the idea is to switch to a bundled or salary-based payment model whereby providers will earn greater financial rewards as quality of care and the health of those they treat improves. sounds simple but this represents a major shift in the way our system currently operates. will it work? that remains to be seen.,[],wmd

what are the benefits of kettlebell training?,"kettlebells have several benefits: they are inexpensive portable and effective at building cardiovascular endurance and muscular strength. with the wide variety of exercises possible with a kettlebell anyone can get an excellent workout using just a single one. instructors generally recommend healthy women begin with a 17 lb. kettlebell while men begin with a 26 lb. kettlebell. staying on top of a fitness plan is always a challenge when youre traveling. however due to their small size and ease of transport kettlebells really can be taken and used anywhere. in addition two recent studies in the journal of strength and conditioning research found that kettlebell routines can significantly improve cardiovascular endurance and muscle strength. kettlebells are a solid investment for anybody looking to improve their endurance and strength. however they can only help you if used the right way. be sure to find a knowledgeable professional in your area to review the exercises. kettlebell exercises involve ballistic movements (swinging). they are inherently dangerous to the person using them to property in the area they are used in and to other people in the vicinity of their use. they also do not give you an even resistance through the range of motion: they can put dangerous levels of torque on joints. compare taking a dumb-bell and doing an overhead press with doing the same thing with a kettlebell. with the the kettlebell the full weight will be directly above the hand and wrist at the maximum extension awkwardly poised on the handle extension of the kettlebell making it very easy to lose balance and twist and injure the wrist either at the top of the extension or when beginning to lower the weight. if however while doing the overhead press equivalent with the kettlebell you allow the main weight to ""hang down "" so the handle is ""on top"" you also risk putting severe strain on the wrist. anyone over 50 over-weight or with any form of back or joint problems arthritis etc. or any medical condition that affects balance should not use them. in my opinion they should only be used in controlled environments supervised by professionals and with safety equipment in place (heavy matting on nearby walls and floors and adequate space between the user and any other person or objects). personally i think they are a fad a danger and should be banned. there are many other safe and sane ways to get either aerobic or anaerobic exercise or both.",[],wmd

glipizide vs metformin as a medication for type 2 diabetes? . i understand that glipizide stimulates the production of more insulin by the pancreas in order to control blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes; that metformin helps to decrease insulin resistance helping the body to absorb the sugar taking it out of the blood faster. which is better? will the pancreas eventually stop production of insulin from constant over stimulation by taking glipizide daily? is there a down side to metformin also?,there's no simple answer to your question however the absolute best option for anyone with type 2 diabetes is exercise and weight management. here's a short synopsis: by the time you are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes around 50% of your beta cells are lost [ and your body's resistance to the action of insulin has been longstanding]. the decline in beta cell function is predictable. it's an absolute fact that treatment of type 2 diabetes with one drug alone won't work to control blood sugars. the decline continues regardless of therapy with metformin or sulfonylureas drugs like xyz. however lifestyle changes like diet and exercise seem to slow the loss of beta cell function by improving insulin sensitivity. other drugs may also stabilize beta cells. after we eat insulin works primarily on muscles. muscles are also the primary site of insulin resistant. by engaging in routine physical activity we use muscles which uses sugar as a source of energy. we also burn excess fat. together these actions result in less insulin resistant improved insulin function and fitness.,"['type 2 diabetes', 'pancreas', 'blood sugar', 'insulin', 'insulin resistance']",wmd

what are mini-warts?,you probably [don't] know much about mini warts (or technically speaking molluscum contagiosum). every summer parents bring their kids in with curious little rashes that just dont seem to go away. they are tiny firm raised flesh-colored bumps that often show up in the armpit the back of the knees the trunk the forearm or the inner thigh. (the only place they dont show up are the palms and soles. ) so what are they? a virus. yes these tiny warts are caused by a virus. and yes that means they are contagious. they spread from person-to-person by direct contact with the spots. and kids can spread them around their own bodies by scratching and picking at them. the spots are kind of itchy but they are really more of a nuisance than a serious health issue. kids with eczema tend to have more problems because the itchy spots lead to scratching which leads to eczema flare-ups. if left alone the molluscum eventually goes away. but eventually can mean 6 months or 4 years. molluscum isnt just a summer virus but i do see more kids with it after spending their summer in the swimming pool. studies looking at the ability of the virus to spread in a chlorinated pool have been inconclusive thus far. thus there are no regulations restricting kids from public swimming pools when theyve got those spots. (besides the fact that one in 10 kids would have to stay out of a pool if there was a rule thats how common molluscum is! ) the molluscum virus also seems to spread through non-chlorinated water (like your bathtub). if one of your kids has molluscum do not let him share a bath or a drying off towel with your other kids. about 40% of kids with molluscum will spread it to their sibling. if you want to get rid of the molluscum before they decide to go away on their own i suggest speaking to your childs doctor or consulting a dermatologist. there are a variety of methods none of which is 100% successful or pain-free. so you should consider the options before proceeding.,['wart'],wmd

can lack of iron in the diet cause anemia?,a lack of iron can cause anemia and iron deficiency is a very common cause of anemia. this is because iron is major component of hemoglobin and is essential for its proper function. chronic blood loss for any reason is the main cause of low iron levels in the body as it can deplete its iron stores to compensate for the ongoing loss of blood. anemia that is due to low iron levels is called iron deficiency anemia. women are more likely than men to have iron deficiency anemia because of the loss of blood each month through normal menstruation. this is generally without any major symptoms as the blood loss is relatively small and temporary. iron deficiency anemia can also be due to small repeated instances of blood loss for instance from colon cancer or from stomach ulcers. stomach ulcer bleeding may be induced by medications even by very common over-the-counter drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen (advil motrin). in infants and young children iron deficiency anemia is most often due to a diet lacking in iron. a doctor's interpretation of complete blood count (cbc) results may give clues to suggest this type of anemia. for instance iron deficiency anemia usually occurs with low mean corpuscular volume (microcytic anemia) in addition to low hemoglobin.,"['anemia', 'diet']",wmd

what is the best bedtime snack that will not raise your morning blood glucose reading? . my blood glucose readings are between 125 and 157 in the morning before eating.,"you don't say if you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes and it makes something of a difference. if you take insulin to control your diabetes you could be experiencing either the ""dawn phenomenon"" or the somogyi effect. it's important to determine what's causing your elevated (though not outrageously i might add) blood sugars in the morning. while the dawn phenomenon is a natural occurrence the somogyi effect can be a result of eating too little of a bedtime snack. before you change your pre-sleep eating habits you should consult with your doctor to discover if the problem is a result of eating or of poor insulin timing. if you don't take insulin to control your diabetes then i'd recommend you eat a protein-rich snack before bedtime. good choices include natural peanut butter (without added sugar) either by itself or on whole-grain crackers some low-fat (or part-skim) string cheese with a small apple or lean meat (such as turkey breast) either by itself or with a slice of whole-grain bread. if you have any questions about controlling your sugars please consult your primary care provider or a certified diabetes educator. best to you!",['snack'],wmd

can spirometers improve lung function,well yes and no. incentive spirometers generally are used by patients after surgery or by people who suffer from an injury (such a fractured rib) that causes them not to breathe well or deeply. as you slowly breathe in through the spirometer it causes inflation of the small sacs in the lungs called alveoli. inflating the alveoli helps keep them free of fluid build-up. fluid build-up in the alveoli can lead to pneumonia. in a healthy individual using an incentive spirometer could theoretically increase air flow which would aid in lung function. studies have not shown that using an incentive spirometer increases or improves lung function in individuals with chronic pulmonary obstructive disorder (copd) or other chronic lung problems. i hope this is helpful!,['lung'],wmd

(varicella is in the herpes virus family but is distinct from hsv-1 and hsv-2 the herpes viruses that commonly affect the lips and genitals. ) varicella is much more likely to affect external skin than moist mucous membranes inside the mouth or vagina. ulcers or sores on the vagina are more often due to hsv-1 or hsv-2 (herpes infections). taking a viral culture from the site of a fresh ulcer is the only way to know for sure though. do hope this helps you. good luck,"['herpes', 'shingles', 'vagina']",wmd

what is emphysema and chronic bronchitis?,"emphysema and chronic bronchitis are chronic (long-term) lung diseases that make it hard to breathe. both diseases are chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (copd) meaning they are conditions that cause a limitation in airflow. emphysema and chronic bronchitis can occur separately or together and are usually the result of cigarette smoking. in addition although it happens rarely a genetic form of emphysema can occur early in adulthood even if you never smoked. in the united states copd is vastly underdiagnosed. while only 15% to 20% of smokers are diagnosed with copd experts believe the majority of smokers develop some degree of airflow obstruction. emphysema comes on gradually after years of exposure to irritants such as cigarette smoke. with emphysema the tiny air sacs in the lungs become damaged. because the tiny sacs lose their ""stretch "" less air gets in and out of the lungs. this causes you to feel short of breath. with chronic bronchitis the airways that carry air to the lungs are inflamed and produce a lot of mucus. the mucus and inflammation cause the airways to narrow or become obstructed making it difficult to breathe. once the airways are irritated over a long period the lining of the airways becomes thickened. this thickening of the airways results in an irritating cough hampered airflow and lung scarring. the damaged airways then become a breeding place for bacterial infections such as pneumonia.","['bronchitis', 'emphysema']",wmd

do i have to meet the family deductible before my health insurance starts paying anything?,the short answer is: it depends. the type of plan you have as well as how your employer (assuming you get your insurance through work) has structured benefits will impact how your deductible is met. according to michael thompson of pricewaterhousecoopers health and welfare practice most plans have an individual and a family deductible. satisfying your deductible generally works like this: ppos and deductibles with a traditional ppo-style plan (preferred provider organization) if one person in your family meets his or her individual deductible benefits will kick in for that person. under the traditional ppo approach the individual would be in benefit even though the family deductible has not yet been met  thompson says. in any case you wont pay more than the total family deductible before insurance begins to pick up the bill for care meaning if you have five members in your family each member wont need to meet the individual deductible. high-deductible plans its a different story with high deductible hsa-qualified plans. in these arrangements if youre covering a family its the larger family deductible (as opposed to the individual deductible) that must be met in order for your benefits to take effect. if you have a $1 500 individual deductible and a $3 000 family deductible the plan wont pay any expenses before the aggregate expenses of the family exceed $3 000  thompson says. in some cases thompson says employers offering health insurance may elect to treat their deductibles the same with all plan types which is why you always need to check to be certain how your benefits operate to avoid expenses you didnt plan for.,"['insurance', 'family']",wmd

food poisoning? consumed 9 day old sliced corned beef (deli) had not checked date on previously opened bag. . within 6 hours extreme chills shaking of trunk and arms. no fever. in bed with lots of blankets still could not get warm. after 3 hours diarrhea. . shaking continued for 3 more hours then finally sleep. . . . next day achey sore all muscles in trunk and arms. diarrhea all day. . . . food poisoning? i can't find where chills are mentioned. thank you.,most helpful answer sorry to hear you went through that. it sounds awful! this definitely could have been a case of food poisoning. many packaged meats (including those from a deli) contain quite a few preservatives but the meat still could have gone bad after nine days. abdominal cramps diarrhea nausea chills fever headache and weakness all can be signs of food poisoning. the exact symptoms relate to the type of germ causing the food poisoning. also symptoms from the most common types of food poisoning usually start within 2 to 6 hours of consuming the contaminated food so your symtpoms match up with that timeframe. except for infants children the elderly pregnant women or those with compromised immune systems most people don't require treatment for food poisoning. it should go away on its own within a couple of days. the best thing to do is drink plenty of water and allow the diarrhea to flow. you want to let those bad germs get out of your body. if the diarrhea continues for more than three days it may be time to try an over-the-counter anti-diarrhea medication or consult a health care provider. i hope you're feeling better by now! you probably won't want any corned beef for awhile.,"['diarrhea', 'food poisoning']",wmd

i am 17 male height 5'2''. want to increase height.,boys stop growing at 20 years of age whereas girls stop growing around age 18 so there still is time. first make sure you are getting enough calories. this chart will give you an idea of how much you need based on your gender age and activity level. you also want to eat regular meals and in between snacks. aim for 4-5 food groups at main meals (lean protein fruit vegetable grain dairy and healthy fat) and 2-3 food groups in between meals. make sure you get adequate calcium and vitamin d for bone growth. you are at beak bone mass and need 1300mg calcium each day! most servings of dairy contain about 300mg (1 cup milk/yogurt and 1/5 ounce of cheese) so 3-4 daily servings helps you meet your needs. the american academy of pediatrics recommend children and adolescents take supplemental vitamin d if they can't get it through diet. remember vitamin d enhances calcium absorbtion. the recommended amount is 600iu but if you are low you may need more. you can also get blood work done to be sure. lastly adequate sleep is needed during times of growth so make sure you get to bed at a decent time at night. you may not be able to do anything about genetics but maximizing nutrition and taking care of yourself can only help you grow to your potential.,['height'],wmd

how does a hiatal hernia cause gerd?,normally there are several mechanisms to prevent acid from flowing backwards (refluxing) up into the esophagus. one mechanism involves a band of esophageal muscle where the esophagus joins the stomach called the lower esophageal sphincter that remains contracted most of the time to prevent acid from refluxing or regurgitating. the sphincter only relaxes when food is swallowed allowing food to pass from the esophagus and into the stomach. the sphincter normally is attached firmly to the diaphragm in the hiatus and the muscle of the diaphragm wraps around the sphincter. the muscle that wraps around the sphincter augments the pressure of the contracted sphincter to further prevent reflux of acid. another mechanism that prevents reflux is the valve-like tissue at the junction of the esophagus and stomach just below the sphincter. the esophagus normally enters the stomach tangentially so that there is a sharp angle between the esophagus and stomach. the thin piece of tissue in this angle composed of esophageal and stomach wall forms a valve that can close off the opening to the esophagus when pressure increases in the stomach for example during strenuous exercise. when a hiatal hernia is present two changes occur. first the sphincter slides up into the chest while the diaphragm remains in its normal location. as a result the pressure normally generated by the diaphragm overlying the sphincter and the pressure generated by the sphincter no longer overlap and as a result the total pressure at the gastro-esophageal junction decreases. second when the gastro-esophageal junction and stomach are pulled up into the chest with each swallow the sharp angle where the esophagus joins the stomach becomes less sharp and the valve-like effect is lost. both changes promote reflux of acid.,"['heartburn', 'hiatal hernia']",wmd

""increasingly employers are providing incentives and offering programs to employees looking to take better control of their health "" says mike thompson a principal in pricewaterhousecoopers' health and welfare practice. this year the incentives to follow through on your weight loss plans among other health goals are greater than ever. here's just a taste of what's being offered to help you keep the weight off: weight watchers at work. onsite nutrition classes. healthier food offerings in the cafeteria and in vending machines. free or reduced membership costs for joining a gym. nurse coaches available by telephone to discuss health management. activity-related programs such as: making pedometers available (to record how many steps you take). web sites to record your level of physical activity in a given day. competitions among workers to get active. walking programs at lunch time. check your benefits package or talk with your human resources department about the types of wellness programs available to you at the office. and if you buy health benefits on your own call your insurance company to ask about weight-loss assistance. both employers and insurers are anxious to help you meet your health goals thompson says. take credit if losing weight and the health benefits that come with it aren't enough to keep the twinkies at bay focus on employer incentives which are richer than ever this year at many companies. employers are hoping that rewards for both action and results will encourage you to engage in healthy behaviors. a growing trend: if you not only enroll in a weight loss program but also make significant progress toward your goal benefits await you. according to thompson among the most common incentives being offered to employees to start and complete wellness programs are: reduced insurance premiums. gift cards. cash. in addition to paying less money for insurance employers will sometimes offer a more robust benefits package with lower co-payments and deductibles to employees who demonstrate a commitment to their health.

what are the symptoms of congestive heart failure?,"the symptoms of congestive heart failure vary among individuals according to the particular organ systems involved and depending on the degree to which the rest of the body has ""compensated"" for the heart muscle weakness. an early symptom of congestive heart failure is fatigue. while fatigue is a sensitive indicator of possible underlying congestive heart failure it is obviously a nonspecific symptom that may be caused by many other conditions. the person's ability to exercise may also diminish. patients may not even sense this decrease and they may subconsciously reduce their activities to accommodate this limitation. as the body becomes overloaded with fluid from congestive heart failure swelling (edema) of the ankles and legs or abdomen may be noticed. this can be referred to as ""right sided heart failure"" as failure of the right sided heart chambers to pump venous blood to the lungs to acquire oxygen results in buildup of this fluid in gravity-dependent areas such as in the legs. the most common cause of this is longstanding failure of the left heart which may lead to secondary failure of the right heart. right-sided heart failure can also be caused by severe lung disease (referred to as ""cor pulmonale"") or by intrinsic disease of the right heart muscle (less common) in addition fluid may accumulate in the lungs thereby causing shortness of breath particularly during exercise and when lying flat. in some instances patients are awakened at night gasping for air. some may be unable to sleep unless sitting upright. the extra fluid in the body may cause increased urination particularly at night. accumulation of fluid in the liver and intestines may cause nausea abdominal pain and decreased appetite.",['congestive heart failure'],wmd

what causes sudden dark brown urine in men? . my husband recently had a kidney stone went to the hospital. he was told he had many stones left in his kidneys. he asked me if i had had diarrhea (thinking we ate something bad) within last week or so. he is having abdominal pain again this time he went to the bathroom urinated & it was dark brown like coffee. he has not had this before. what are the possible causes of this. we have not eaten anything like rhubarb or dark greens and only had one cup of coffee this morning as usual. help!,"most helpful answer if your husband has known kidney stones and suddenly gets brown urine tis is most likely due to blood (older hydrolyzed blood; not the bright red blood seen in a fresh bleed). this could indicate the movement of a stone into the bladder or anywhere in the urinary tract including the kidney. stones cause inflammation and inflammation can result in bleeding. he needs to see his urologist again or at least have the urologist order a urinalysis. other causes of dark brown tea-like urine would be hepatitis but because of his stone history this would be highest on the list. so sorry to hear about the kidney stones and now this weird new symptom. it's always disconcerting when our body fluids change color! your husband should see his doctor as soon as possible. dark brown urine can be a sign of liver malfunction which could be caused by several things including medications. before you head for the doctor's office take note of the color and quality (firm loose etc. ) of your husband's stools. this information will help your doctor more quickly rule out possible causes for the brown urine. meanwhile your husband probaby should avoid consuming alcohol or acetaminophen (tylenol) just in case he's having an issue with his liver. if he has been prescribed a narcotic pain reliever such as oxycodone-apap he should weigh whether or not he can get along without it since ""apap"" is shorthand for acetaminophen. if you have any questions about whether any of his prescriptions contain acetaminophen you can speak to a pharmacist for clarification. i wish you all the best!",[],wmd

what affects drug metabolization from dose to dose?,"drug metabolism is the process by which the body breaks down medications. the liver plays a major role in metabolism especially a group of enzymes known as cytochrome p-450. drug interactions can occur when two or more drugs inhibit or induce a p-450 reaction and the drugs do not metabolize as quickly as they should. nicotine is a ""drug"" also and is known to induce the p-450 system. individuals with liver disease may also have insufficient levels of p-450 enzymes. the result is that drug levels can remain high in the bloodstream and cause more side effects. genetic factors also play a role in drug metabolism. the metabolic rate can vary significantly from person to person and drug dosages that work quickly and effectively in one individual may not work well for another or cause build-up and more side effects. infants and elderly patients have a reduced abilty to metabolize certain drugs so we often adjust their med dosage. but we find that people with fm [fibromyalgia] seem to act like ""geriatric patients"" in terms of sensitivity to meds and side effects (and metabolism? ) and often require lower doses than the ""normal"" non-fm adult. certain foods such as grapefruit juice and certain meds taken on an occasional basis can inactivate or lessen the metabolic activity of p-450s and can cause apparent fluctuations in response/tolerence to regular prescribed meds. we with fibro always seem to develop tolerances and intolerances to meds that we previously did well with which is frustrating to say the least. so there are different metabolism tolerance and intolerance factors that can cause us to have ""reactions"" to our meds. .",['drug'],wmd

does it matter what time of day a person works out to promote the most weight loss? . i usually work out 30 min. before breakfast but wonder if i should do this before dinner since that is my largest meal to help rev up my metabolism to better promote weight loss. i don't see much weight loss now with my current regimen.,there doesnt seem to be a definitive answer in regards to what time of day will provide the most weight loss benefit from exercise. for you the best time of day is going to be whatever helps you in establishing a consistent routine. it helps to make exercise as convenient and enjoyable as possible for yourself so that its easier for you to stay on track. i would suggest experimenting with doing exercise at different times of day to see what works best for you. are you enough of a morning person to commit to waking up early? early morning exercise is great but it may not be good for you if you end up sleep deprived or if youre prone to hitting the snooze button and end up skipping exercise sessions. is it possible to exercise during a lunch break for a mid-afternoon energy boost? what about after work or are you too tired from a long hard day of work and just want to relax? late-afternoon or early evening exercise works well for some but may be a challenge if you have other after-work obligations or commitments that might interfere. does exercising too late in the evening affect your sleep or cause you to have insomnia? ultimately the best time of day for you to exercise is going to be specific to what meets your needs and what works best with your schedule and lifestyle. the best thing to do is to find a time that helps to establish a consistent exercise routine. different people lives and schedules = different workout times. one thing i always make sure to do is exercise before i eat a meal. not after. sometimes i work out in the morning sometimes in the afternoon. this is largely based on my sleep/rest. as long as i get my own personal needs of eight hours of sleep a night i will get up and exercise early in the morning. my two big points here. are get enough rest and exercise if possible before eating meal or make sure to put something in your body after. i find the mornings before breakfast to be the best. here's what happens. you're exercising on an empty stomach so your blood has to pull energy from your fat reserves. then after exercising don't eat anything for at least 30 minutes. this allows your blood to stabilize to catch up to its normal state again from fat. this gives plenty of time to shower and otherwise get ready for work. then have a good breakfast. if you eat immediately after exercising your blood will replenish from that instead of your fat and you'll have less weight loss. and you've revved up your metabolizm to burn your breakfast instead of store it. i just wanted the answer to the question about the different time of day about a beneficial workout - could not seem to figure out where to get the answer - should it be this complicated? i myself walk for 30 minutes on my lunch hour before i eat my lunch. i used to when i was younger work out after work. i have heard that working out early morning is great i couldn't do it and before dinner now i'm too tired.,"['vision', 'meal', 'weight loss', 'metabolism']",wmd

what are the side affects of taking 3 to 5 times recomended otc probiotic would it cause unhealthy weight loss. i think this is causing my wife to loss weight by stopping nutrition being absorbed,"most helpful answer well first let me say no one should take more than the recommended dose of any medication or supplement. there's usually a good reason why those limits were set. just because supplements are often labeled as ""natural"" or ""healthy"" doesn't mean you can't experience serious side effects by taking too much of any given product. that said i doubt taking a lot of probiotics would cause weight loss. probiotics replenish the ""good flora"" of the intestinal tract which probably has no effect on the uptake of nutrients but theoretically can prevent diarrhea caused by taking antibiotics possibly help prevent urinary tract infections and have a beneficial effect on colon inflammation. if your wife is experiencing unintended weight loss you are right to be concerned. only an examination by a medical professional can help her figure out what is causing the weight loss. i'd suggest she make an appointment with her primary health care provider to discuss the issue. best of luck to you both!","['weight', 'weight loss', 'nutrition']",wmd

why do i still get morning coughs a year after quitting smoking. no phlem. wakes me up at night. night and morning only.,good for you for quitting smoking! that is a true achievement to be proud of. in terms of the persistent cough one year later: that is a good question and i would advise you to take it up with your primary care provider (physician nurse practitioner or physician assistant). several possible explanations for the coughing come to mind. first depending on how long you smoked you may have permanently damaged your lungs which results in their inability to clear mucus. although you're not coughing up any phlegm it could still be residing down there in your lungs and triggering a coughing response. second smoking damages more than just the lungs. again depending on how long (and how much) you smoked you may have damaged your heart muscle. if the heart cannot contract with enough force to move blood through the lungs properly it causes congestion to occur. this congestion can cause a dry hacking cough - especially when you're lying down. i think you definitely should see your health care provider for an exam. the cause of the cough may be highly treatable if caught in time. best wishes to you!,"['cough', 'quit smoking']",wmd

what causes pneumonia?,"viruses bacteria or (in rare cases) parasites or other organisms cause pneumonia. in most cases the specific organism (such as bacteria or virus) cannot be identified even with testing. when an organism is identified it is usually the bacteria streptococcus pneumoniae. many types of bacteria may cause pneumonia. pneumonia caused by mycoplasma pneumonia is sometimes mild and called ""walking pneumonia. "" viruses such as influenza a (the flu virus) and respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) can cause pneumonia. in people with impaired immune systems pneumonia may be caused by other organisms including some forms of fungi such as pneumocystis jiroveci (formally called pneumocystis carinii). this fungus frequently causes pneumonia in people who have aids. some doctors may suggest an hiv test if they think that pneumocystis jiroveci is causing the pneumonia. you may get pneumonia: after you breathe infected air particles into your lungs. after you breathe certain bacteria from your nose and throat into your lungs. this generally occurs during sleep. during or after a viral upper respiratory infection such as a cold or influenza (flu). as a complication of a viral illness such as measles or chickenpox. if you breathe large amounts of food gastric juices from the stomach or vomit into the lungs (aspiration pneumonia). this can happen when you have had a medical condition that affects your ability to swallow such as a seizure or stroke. a healthy person's nose and throat often contain bacteria or viruses that cause pneumonia. pneumonia can develop when these organisms spread to your lungs while your lungs are more likely to be infected such as during or soon after a cold or if you have a long-term (chronic) illness such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. you can get pneumonia in your daily life such as at school or work (community-associated pneumonia) or when you are in a hospital or nursing home (healthcare-associated pneumonia). treatment may differ in healthcare-associated pneumonia because bacteria causing the infection in hospitals may be different from those causing it in the community. this topic focuses on community-associated pneumonia. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.",['pneumonia'],wmd

why would a gunshot wound in the arm not be stitched or sutured? . we took my son to the specialist 48 hours after the gunshot was treated in the er at a hospital. the specialists office was shocked that they left both of the wounds unstitched or sutured. he bled badly when the bandage was removed at the doctor. there was no evidence of iodine/beta dine on the wounds either. is this common because all our sources say it was not proper procedure. please advise us. he now has to be kept on antibiotics for an extended period of time. too late to stitch now!,unfortunately i do not know the medical details of this gunshot wound to comment specifically. some wounds are sutured and some are not. if the clinician knows that there are absolutely no foreign materials (pieces of cloth dirt bullet fragments etc. then it may be closed. if a wound is sutured with even the tiniest piece of foreign material it is highly likely to get infected so many surgeons will leave it open to drain. if a sutured wound becomes infected it may need to be opened. if the wound is in an area that is cosmetic (face neck etc. ) then it should be closed. antibiotics are often appropriate since wound infections will complicate healing. i am not sure what type of specialist that is being seen now but since they have the ability to examine the person they are the ones who can best comment on the quality of care.,"['wound', 'arm', 'iodine', 'antibiotic', 'period']",wmd

what types of injections are used to treat osteoarthritis?,joint injections for knee oa (osteoarthritis) may be an alternative for people who dont find relief from oral medications or arent able to take them. joint injections are given at your doctors office. first your doctor may take fluid out of your knee with a needle and then inject one of the following: corticosteroids. these medications are related to cortisone a hormone your body makes to fight inflammation. injecting corticosteroids directly into affected knee joints can quickly and effectively reduce pain and inflammation. the relief can last from several weeks to several months. hyaluronic acid. these injections are designed to help boost the hyaluronic acid found naturally in your joints which keep them moving smoothly. in people with osteoarthritis the hyaluronic acid gets thinner and less slippery. several hyaluronic acid products are approved for treating osteoarthritis of the knee. they may ease pain for months to a year sometimes longer.,"['osteoarthritis', 'injection']",wmd
i have high potassium and dr recently d/c hctz and lisinopril but left me on spironolactone. is this right? . type 1 diabetic 21 years heart stent stage 3 kidney disease. 29 yrs old female,"to get the best answer to your question i'd suggest picking up the phone and discussing your concerns with your health care provider. he or she will be happy to explain the rationale behind leaving you on spironolactone while discontinuing the other drugs. my hunch is that your provider feared your potassium might dip too low after withdrawing the hctz (hydrochlorothiazide) which can strip potassium from your system. by leaving you on a ""potassium-sparing"" diuretic (water pill) like spironolactone perhaps your provider thinks your potassium will level out. however that's just a guess. obviously i can't read your provider's mind. as i said your best bet is to ask your provider directly. wishing you all the best!","['diabetes', 'heart', 'potassium', 'stent', 'kidney disease']",wmd

what is a fever?,fever refers to an elevation in body temperature. technically any body temperature above the normal oral measurement of 98. 6 f (37 c) or the normal rectal temperature of 99 f (37. 2 c) is considered to be elevated. however these are averages and one's normal body temperature may actually be 1 f (0. 6 c) or more above or below the average of 98. 6 f. body temperature can also vary up to 1 f (0. 6 c) throughout the day. fever is not considered medically significant until body temperature is above 100. 4 f (38 c). anything above normal but below 100. 4 f (38 c) is considered a low-grade fever. fever serves as one of the body's natural defenses against bacteria and viruses which cannot live at a higher temperature. for that reason low fevers should normally go untreated unless accompanied by troubling symptoms. also the body's defense mechanisms seem to work more efficiently at a higher temperature. fever is just one part of an illness many times no more important than the presence of other symptoms such as cough sore throat fatigue joint pains or aches chills nausea etc. fevers of 104 f (40 c) or higher demand immediate home treatment and subsequent medical attention as they can result in delirium and convulsions particularly in infants and children. fever should not be confused with hyperthermia which is a defect in your body's response to heat (thermoregulation) which can also raise the body temperature. this is usually caused by external sources such as being in a hot environment.,['fever'],wmd

why do schools send home kids with a fever?,fever is the bodys natural response to fighting off infection or inflammation. fever is most prevalent as a response in the younger crowd. the older we get the less often we get fevers to help us get better. fever is good and should not be feared no matter what grandma told you or what you have heard. fever is just a sign not a disease. school authorities will exclude children since they have no idea what the child is biologically cooking. if children have a contagious illness the fever stage — those first few days of an illness — would be time when they are most contagious. with that said exposure to an infectious disease like a common cold or even strep does not necessarily imply that the person exposed will get it. many schools and day care facilities require that a child be fever-free for 24 hours before coming back to the herd. this is probably a reasonable parameter but 24 hours after getting back into that classroom the child can get another viral infection and the dance will continue. there are no rules that a child with one viral infection cant get another. many kids especially those new to school or day care will seem to have one continuous cold lasting months. in reality they have had many overlapping (coalescing) viral infections during this period — a new cold starting before the first one went away. some fever facts:  kids will be excluded from school or day care with fever. period. schools set their own rules whether we necessarily agree with them or not.  fever in kids will cost you a lot of missed days at work. period.  fever is the bodys normal response to fighting off an illness — a good thing. it does not require treatment unless the child is uncomfortable.  lowering body temperature does not shorten the course of an illness; if anything it may prolong it.  fevers that occur early in a viral illness are expected and should be welcomed. fevers later in an illness may be a sign of a secondary infection.  keep your cool. fever is a sign not a disease. statistically fevers in kids indicate a viral infection; but not always. your medical provider is your best resource to determine the significance and reason for a fever.,['fever'],wmd

what happens to someone when they get cataracts?,"cataracts may remain small and may not be noticeable. they often do not seriously affect vision. and many cataracts do not need to be removed. some cataracts grow larger or denser over time causing severe vision changes. severe cataracts can cause loss of independence for older adults as decreased vision may affect driving working reading or hobbies. while cataracts can cause blindness this is rare. surgery is usually done before a cataract progresses far enough to cause blindness. a rare type of cataract can lead to glaucoma. as a cataract progresses more of the lens becomes cloudy. when the entire lens is white the cataract is called a ""ripe"" or ""mature"" cataract and causes severe vision problems. delaying surgery until cataracts are ripe or mature is neither recommended nor necessary. cataracts in children are rare but serious. if a cataract prevents light from entering a child's eye and stimulating the retina the area of the brain used for sight does not develop properly. usually the child won't see well with that eye ( amblyopia ) even if the cataract is later removed. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © 1995-2011 healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.",['cataract'],wmd

are boils contagious?,boils themselves are not contagious but the bacteria that cause boils are. boils are skin infections commonly caused by the bacteria in the family staphylococcus or by other bacteria. the bacteria manage to temporarily evade the bodys defenses and grow in a tightly defined area. small boils often go away without treatment. in some cases the skin infection may progress to become an abscess: a lump with a pocket of infected liquid (pus) inside. touching someones boil then your own skin wont necessarily cause a boil to form there. the process by which boils form is more complicated than that. the bacteria may spread to the new persons skin but never cause a boil. some people are more susceptible to boils and skin infections than others. one member of the staphylococcus family called mrsa (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) causes a large percentage of boils today. mrsa is spread from person to person in close contact. outbreaks of mrsa have occurred in dormitories military barracks athletic facilities and prisons  all places where people are in close contact. good personal hygiene is the most sensible approach to prevent the spread of bacteria that can cause skin infections. wash your hands with soap and water after touching a boil. a boil can be kept lightly covered with clean gauze. apply warm-water compresses to help your body clear the infection. if you have a persistent boil or feel you need to squeeze or lance a boil see a doctor. in my family it has been contagious just by walking into the infected persons home with never touching a thing and walking right back out and within 25-48 hours will have one so for us it has been airborn and recently when one gets a boul another gets mrsa well yes yes yes,['boil'],wmd

my doctor has given me a really expensive medication pristiq. are there any ways to reduce those costs?,i know it's hard to justify when you get a new medication and it's expensive. but this medication might be the right medication and in the long run might actually save you money. this is a once-a-day medication it's used for depression. and if it helps you and it makes you feel better then that's a good price to pay. when you don't feel well with depression and you don't take these types of medications and you take some that have to be taken more frequently or might have more side-effects you forget to take them. therefore if there is a price on your quality of life and then also you are going to see the doctor more often which means that your overall healthcare costs are actually going up. so there are patient assistance programs available through the manufacturers patients may want to look into that as helping offset the cost of that medication. at the end of the day it might be the right fit.,['drug'],wmd

can fatty liver disease be reveresed,that's an interesting question. for those who aren't familiar with fatty liver disease it's a condition in which fat literally encases the liver and clogs it up. this can cause the liver to become inflamed or scarred. when it becomes scarred the liver cannot function properly. liver scarring cannot be reversed. if your fatty liver disease has not caused inflammation and scarring you stand a good chance of reversing it. here are a few things you can do: 1. stop drinking alcohol. although fatty liver disease is not the same as cirrhosis caused by alcoholism consuming alcohol can damage the liver. 2. lose weight. new research suggests a slow weight loss of up to 10% of your body weight can help reduce the amount of excess fat in your liver. 3. if you have diabetes make sure you control your sugars. diabetes can put you at higher risk of developing fatty liver disease. 4. eat healthy. it's that simple. wishing you well!,['fatty liver disease'],wmd

when do i use an antacid versus an h2 blocker versus a proton pump inhibitor?,that's a great question and it all depends on how frequent your heartburn is. if you just have an occasional bout of heartburn for instance you ate a spicy meal then you can use a regular antacid a maalox or a mylanta product. you want to make sure though that you shake it really well; a lot of people forget about that. also too if you are taking medications you may need to space it; either take it an hour before you take your medications or two hours afterwards because it can actually bind to the medicine and therefore the medicine won't work as well. if you notice though that you have like two days in a row where you have had consistent heartburn then you may want to try a h2 blocker. pepcid is one consideration. zantac. you want to talk to your pharmacist though and let us know if you are taking any other medications. zantac has a tendency to interact with other medicines. so if you have your medication list handy we can take a look at it and make sure there is no potential for drug interactions. if it's two or more episodes a week that you are experiencing heartburn then you are going to want to go towards the proton pump inhibitor and prilosec otc is an example of that. you want to use it for 14 days but once again you want to talk to your pharmacist to make sure that you are not taking any other medicines or possibly taking any duplicate medicines that could do the same thing. then also if you are not feeling well after the 14 days a pharmacist is probably going to refer you back to your doctor or healthcare provider because it probably needs a little bit more evaluation.,['proton pump inhibitor'],wmd

what causes gallstones?,there are several types of gallstones and each type has a different cause. cholesterol gallstones cholesterol gallstones are made primarily of cholesterol. they are the most common type of gallstone comprising 80% of gallstones in individuals from europe and the americas. cholesterol is one of the substances that liver cells secrete into bile. (secretion of cholesterol into bile is an important way in which the liver eliminates excess cholesterol from the body). in order for bile to carry cholesterol the cholesterol must be dissolved in the bile. cholesterol is a fat however and bile is an aqueous or watery solution; fats do not dissolve in watery solutions. in order to make the cholesterol dissolve in bile the liver also secretes two detergents  bile acids and lecithin  into the bile. these detergents just like dishwashing detergents dissolve the fatty cholesterol so that it can be carried by bile through the ducts. if the liver secretes too much cholesterol for the amount of bile acids and lecithin it secretes some of the cholesterol does not dissolve. similarly if the liver does not secrete enough bile acids and lecithin some of the cholesterol also does not dissolve. in either case the undissolved cholesterol sticks together and forms particles of cholesterol that grow in size and eventually form larger gallstones. there are two other processes that promote the formation of cholesterol gallstones though neither process is able to cause cholesterol gallstones by itself. the first is abnormally rapid formation and growth of cholesterol particles into gallstones. thus with the same concentrations of cholesterol bile acids and lecithin in their bile patients with gallstones form particles of cholesterol more rapidly than individuals without gallstones. the second process that promotes the formation and growth of gallstones is reduced contraction and emptying of the gallbladder that allows bile to sit in the gallbladder longer so that there is more time for cholesterol particles to form and grow. pigment gallstones pigment gallstones are the second most common type of gallstone. although pigment gallstones comprise only 15% of gallstones in individuals from europe and the americas they are more common than cholesterol gallstones in southeast asia. there are two types of pigment gallstones 1) black pigment gallstones and 2) brown pigment gallstones. pigment is a waste product formed from hemoglobin the oxygen-carrying chemical in red blood cells. the hemoglobin from old red blood cells that are being destroyed is changed into a chemical called bilirubin and released into the blood. bilirubin is removed from the blood by the liver. the liver modifies the bilirubin and secretes the modified bilirubin or into bile. black pigment gallstones: if there is too much bilirubin in bile the bilirubin combines with other constituents in bile for example calcium to form pigment (so-called because it is dark brown in color). pigment dissolves poorly in bile and like cholesterol it sticks together and forms particles that grow in size and eventually form gallstones. the pigment gallstones that form in this manner are called black pigment gallstones because they are black and hard. brown pigment gallstones: if there is reduced contraction of the gallbladder or obstruction to the flow of bile through the ducts bacteria may ascend from the duodenum into the bile ducts and gallbladder. the bacteria alter the bilirubin in the ducts and gallbladder and the altered bilirubin then combines with calcium to form pigment. the pigment then combines with fats in bile (cholesterol and fatty acids from lecithin) to form particles that grow into gallstones. this type of gallstone is called a brown pigment gallstone because it is more brown than black. it also is softer than black pigment gallstones. other types of gallstones. other types of gallstones are rare. perhaps the most interesting type of gallstone is the gallstone that forms in patients taking the antibiotic ceftriaxone (rocephin). ceftriaxone is unusual in that it is eliminated from the body in bile in high concentrations. it combines with calcium in bile and becomes insoluble. like cholesterol and pigment the insoluble ceftriaxone and calcium form particles that grow into gallstones. most of these gallstones disappear once the antibiotic is stopped but they still may cause problems until they disappear. another rare type of gallstone is formed from calcium carbonate.,['gallstone'],wmd

what are the implications of taking mdma while i have damaged nerves in my shoulder? are there long-term side effects?,there is no doubt that ecstasy has a strong effect on nerves releasing excess levels of nerve chemicals (called neurotransmitters). in fact studies in animals have shown prolonged nerve damage after using mdma  showing effects even 6 to 7 years later. it's safe to assume that it's not healthy for your nerves and could be worsening any nerve damage you have. in addition ecstasy has plenty of dangerous side effects  it can even be deadly. mdma commonly causes confusion depression sleep problems drug cravings and severe anxiety. i would highly recommend not using ecstasy or any other drug. if you need help stopping since the drug can be addictive for some people talk to your doctor or a therapist about getting some help. the long-term effects of using ecstasy (mdma) far out-weigh any temporary relief an individual may gain. for example individuals may experience an increased heart rate and blood pressure chills and sweating nausea dizziness anxiety agitation depress and sadness. one of the more dangerous side effects from mdma use is dehydration. the drug can interfere with the bodys natural thermostat and prevent it from cooling internally and as a result the body can overheat. this dangerous side effect has led to cases of hyperthermia caused kidney and heart damage heart attack seizures and may be fatal. gallus detox centers is an inpatient medical detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at 855-338-6929.,"['nerve', 'shoulder']",wmd

how to get fluid behind the eardrum to drain. i have been to the doctors several times and on several antibiotics and i have no pain in my ear but i cant hear from the fluid built up. what can i do,"there are only a few things that can be done for middle ear effusion (fluid). 1. you can wait it out but after three months you need to see an ent. 2. decongestants nasal corticosteroids etc. have all been used with limited success. sometimes it helps. sometimes it doesn't. antibiotics are not usually helpful since this is more of ""plumbing and ventilation"" issue. not an infection. 3. an ent may need to surgical drain the fluid (tympanostomy) or suction and place tubes in your ears. i went scuba diving for 6 days in a row last week and got water behind my right eardrum. i kept hoping it would clear up but after 8 days it was as bad as ever and it would only clear momentary if i hung my head upside-down. with my head right side up the water rested against my eardrum and i couldn't hear much through that ear. after reading on the web about the structure of the ear i learned that the eustachian tube connects the ear to the nose and i realized that the water was going to have to exit that tube. now apparently that tube isn't there to drain liquid or it would have done so already; i bet it's just for air to flow through to equalize pressure probably thanks to our aquatic ape ancestors. whatever. it's the key and the only way to get flow though it is to take advantage of it's connection to the nose. i pinched my nose and blew hard until my ears popped. that's the same thing scuba divers do as they descend by the way. apparently i didn't do it often enough because some of that ocean water wound up on the wrong side of my eardrum and the only way it'd get there is if the pressure on the inside of my eardrum was lower than the pressure on the outside (where the ocean was). then i pinched my nose and sucked hard until my ears popped going the other direction. i was moving air in and out of my ears through the eustachian tube. after doing this about 10 times the water was gone and i can once again hear through my right ear. fluid in the ear is most annoying and can be damaging to your ear. i caution you though about the decision to have ""tubes"" put in the ear drum to drain this fluid. i had tubes in for about 2 years they fell out. i actually had the little tiny plastic rings. they are less tubes than just little rings of plastic. most often the ear drum heals itself after the tubes fall out mine did not. i now have very tiny holes in my ear drums this is a problem. i cannot swim in a lake for fear the water will enter into the ear and this water can carry many nasty little bugs viruses bacteria and so on. many lakes in my area end up at one time or another have to be closed to swimmers due to high bacteria counts e-coli is just one of the many things that can be found in lake water. you do not want this to fester in your ear. depending on the type of tube used scar tissue can be left behind and ear drum will not heal on it's own. so you need another surgery to attempt to have the ear drum heal. the first attempt and it is beyond me why they even do this one the surgeon roughs up the ear drum and then places a thin patch of some kind of material over the hole(s) and hope this will work. this is only 60% effective. but it's your only option. i don't like the odds but that's all i was offered. i did not sneeze nor blow my nose for two months. and i was diligent in this i did not want another surgery i wanted this to work. it did not work at all. so now if i want to pursue it i have to submit to another surgery more anesthesia. risk. and the surgeon doesn't like this one because it's ""very tiny surgery"" is what i was told. they have to stitch the hole closed and i would imagine it's a big pain in the you know where. so don't just jump into this surgery. especially if you are not having pain. i would try more medications give it some more time try decongestants or antihistamines to dry out the ear(s). another go with antibiotics which i know is a real pain in and of itself. but don't just jump into surgery especially if you want to be able to swim this summer. pools are a better choice because the water is chlorinated but chlorine can damage as well. you will need ear plugs to swim but that's not a 100% guarantee that water will not get into the ear. i was told to use cotton balls covered in vaseline petroleum jelly when bathing or when swimming. this is disgusting and it does not come out of your ear. so you walk around with vaseline in your ears. really think about it. when i was a little girl i had swimmers ear; water behind the ear. i went to the doctor and he told me to drop alcohol in my ear until i heard it 'fill up'. you do this by tilting you head to the opposite side that has the water and slowly drop alcohol in the ear until you hear it 'fill up'. then press a kleenex or clean cloth against that ear to restrict the exit flow of alcohol and slowly tilt your head toward the side that has the water and slowly release the alcohol from the ear. you will hear it chug chugging as it exits and the last bit of flow should feel warm; that is the trapped water. i have used this technique for years when swimming or anytime i think i have water behind my ear. it works beautifully. i have had this for a month and apart from a nasal steroid spray the doctor says it will go on it's own accord. i have tried holding my nose and blowing hard into your cheeks but you just have to keep trying. try drinking laying down as well. it's a miserable complaint.","['ears', 'eardrum', 'drainage', 'pain', 'antibiotic']",wmd

can powder with cornstarch like gold bond baby powder help with a 3 year olds heat rash under her arms? . my granddaughter has a rash under the arms that looks like a heat rash. can powder like gold bond baby powder with cornstarch help? she is 3 years old. thankyou,"aw poor baby! you should be pretty safe using a product like baby powder or even plain cornstarch out of the box to treat this possible heat rash. if the rash doesn't clear up within the day you might keep an eye on it. it's likely nothing serious but it could be something along the lines of a fungal infection (similar to athlete's foot). be sure to gently cleanse the area with cool water and a mild soap. most important pat it dry thoroughly. (don't rub because it will hurt! ) as i'm sure you know it's not at all unusual for toddlers to develop weird skin rashes that sort of come and go. they're usually only problematic when they refuse to ""go "" or if the rash is accompanied by fever. in that case it's time to visit the doctor. wishing you and your granddaughter well!","['heat rash', 'rash', 'arm']",wmd

what is the best way to treat exzima? . redness. bumpy skin. itchy. dry ski. sensitive to sunlight. embarrassing blotches,"eczema is genetically dry skin. there is no ""cure"" but there are effective treatments. first be sure that you are dealing with eczema (atopic dermatitis). see a dermatologist if you are not clear. the steps: 1. moisturization is the key so use a good skin moisturizer  one without perfumes  and sue it often. 2. avoid scratching at all costs since this can lead to secondary skin infection. antihistamines can be used fo control itching. 3. control inflammation. using hydrocortisone cream (available over the counter) will help. 4. keep the skin very clean. and cool. warm sweaters (especially wool) will drive eczema crazy. 5. be patient. controlling eczema takes time. do not hesitate to involve a dermatologist if your home management is not working.",[],wmd
non-itchy raised bumps at leg with central dimple. viral or fungal? bug bite?,"if it's viral there's absolutely nothing you can do about it and it's probably a virus called roseola; you simply just have to let your body fight the virus on its own until it eventually overcomes it. i personally had this virus before and it lasted up to three months. if it's anything fungal it would definitely be itchy therefore i would safely rule that possibility out. if it's a bug bite (seeing as how most bug bites become itchy and somewhat sensitive) it's unlikely to be a mosquito unless you're allergic to them and the bumps are massive in size; my guess is that you have been bitten up by a spider of some sort yet not a black widow or a brown recluse seeing as how the center ""dimple"" of the bump would become much darker in color  and they tend to spew out pus as well.","['leg', 'virus']",wmd

i have frequent urination at night. what causes that?,i don't know anything about you to blindly determine a specific cause not even your sex. if you are male and over the age of 50 it could be bph (benign prostatic hypertrophy). if you are a female one would need to consider a urinary tract infection or variety of urinary tract problems. and in either sex nocturia (the medical name for this condition) could be one of the signs of diabetes. on a more simple case you could be drinking too much in the evening and not completely emptying your bladder. see your medical provider. this is really the only way to determine a reason and hopefully find a solution.,['urination'],wmd
