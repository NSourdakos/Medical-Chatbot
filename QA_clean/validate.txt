a minimally thickened cord is of questionable importance. please get your urine analysis also. idiopathic orchialgia is very common in young people. i suggest you wear scrotal support. the testes carry a spiral muscle called cremaster with them while coming out of the abdomen to lie in the scrotum at the birth of a male child. the testes are in a dynamic position hanging in the scrotum. they adjust according to stimulus like temperature change touch and excitation. in some young people this causes pain due to strong muscles. with aging this decreases. if it bothers a lot then you may need treatment. keep them close to the body by using scrotal support. this is neuropathic pain so i suggest tablet pregabalin as and when required. consult your doctor discuss with him or her and take medicine with consent. treatment plan:continue antibiotics for  days. it takes time to resolve the pain of epididymitis may be four weeks. regarding follow up:for further information consult a urologist online. ---> <link>,what is the permanent solution for testicular pain?,['urine analysis'],ic

you suspect an outbreak is beginning. if you take antiviral drugs in the early stages you may shorten the course of the infection. shingles on your face spreads near your eye. seek treatment from an eye doctor (ophthalmologist) to avoid possible cornea damage. the affected area becomes secondarily infected with bacteria (indicated by spreading redness swelling a high fever and pus). antibiotics can help halt the spread of bacterial infection but not the shingles itself. your rash lasts longer than  days without improvement. get treatment to avoid potential nerve damage. the pain becomes too great to bear. your doctor may prescribe stronger painkillers or a nerve block.,when should i call my doctor about shingles?,['shingles'],wmd

for the majority of children suffering hair loss one of the following conditions is the cause. your child's pediatrician or a pediatric dermatologist should be able to diagnose these conditions and prescribe the appropriate treatment. tinea capitis. tinea capitis commonly known as ringworm of the scalp is a fungal infection often seen in children. it can show up in a number of ways but often as scaly patches of hair loss on the head. the patches are usually round or oval. the hairs may be broken off at the surface of the skin and look like black dots on the scalp. because ringworm is contagious your child should be careful not to share any objects that touch the head such as hats pillow cases or brushes. alopecia areata. alopecia areata is a non-contagious condition of hair loss thought to be caused by the body's immune system attacking the hair follicles. it is characterized by the sudden appearance of round or oval patches of hair loss. the patches are slick or smooth without scaling or broken hairs. about % of children also have pitting and ridging of the nails. while there is no cure for alopecia areata treatment can control the disease in some children. many have their hair back within a year although regrowth is unpredictable and many will lose hair again. for about % of children the disease progresses to alopecia totalis -- loss of all of the hair on the scalp. some of these will develop alopecia universalis -- a total loss of body hair. trichotillomania. trichotillomania is hair loss caused by pulling plucking twisting or rubbing. the hair loss is patchy and characterized by broken hairs of varying length. patches are typically seen on the side of the child's dominant hand. trichotillomania may be triggered by a stressor in your child's life such as the loss of a grandparent birth of a sibling or a divorce. if you notice your child pulling hair scolding will not likely be helpful. however counseling to help your child deal with the source of stress that triggered the habit may help stop it. telogen effluvium. telogen effluvium is a condition in which a sudden or severe stress -- such as extremely high fever surgery under general anesthesia the death of a loved one a severe injury or the use of certain prescription medications -- interrupts the normal cycle of hair growth. the hair follicles stop growing prematurely and enter a resting phase (called the telogen phase). between six and  weeks later hair sheds excessively leading to partial or complete baldness. there are no conclusive tests to diagnose telogen effluvium; there is also no treatment for it. however once the stressful event is over full hair growth usually returns within six months to a year. nutritional deficiency. though less common hair loss can be a symptom of deficiencies in certain nutrients including: vitamin h or biotin one of the b complex of vitamins which help the body to convert carbohydrates into glucose to fuel the body. zinc an essential mineral involved in numerous aspects of cellular metabolism. it also supports normal growth and development during pregnancy childhood and adolescence. in some cases hair loss can be a symptom of too much vitamin a. with a healthy varied diet most children will not experience nutritional deficiencies that lead to hair loss. however if you suspect a problem speak to your child's doctor before giving nutritional supplements. endocrine problems. in some children the cause of hair loss is hypothyroidism a condition in which the thyroid is underactive and is producing an insufficient amount of thyroid hormones required for regulating metabolism. a diagnosis of hypothyroidism is made by a blood test and possibly a scan of the thyroid gland.,what are the medical causes of hair loss in children?,['hair loss'],wmd
irritable bowel syndrome. irritable bowel syndrome is a functional cause of diarrhea or constipation. inflammation does not typically exist in the affected bowel. (nevertheless recent information suggests that there may be a component of inflammation in ibs. ) it may be caused by several different underlying problems but it is believed that the most common cause is rapid passage of the intestinal contents through the colon. infectious diseases. there are a few infectious diseases that can cause chronic diarrhea for example giardia lamblia. patients with aids often have chronic infections of their intestines that cause diarrhea. bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine. because of small intestinal problems normal colonic bacteria may spread from the colon and into the small intestine. when they do they are in a position to digest food that the small intestine has not had time to digest and absorb. the mechanism that leads to the development of diarrhea in bacterial overgrowth is not known. post-infectious. following acute viral bacterial or parasitic infections some individuals develop chronic diarrhea. the cause of this type of diarrhea is not clear but some of the individuals have bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine. this condition also is referred to as post-infectious ibs. inflammatory bowel disease. crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis diseases causing inflammation of the small intestine and/or colon commonly cause chronic diarrhea. colon cancer. colon cancer can cause either diarrhea or constipation. if the cancer blocks the passage of stool it usually causes constipation. sometimes however there is secretion of water behind the blockage and liquid stool from behind the blockage leaks around the cancer and results in diarrhea. cancer particularly in the distal part of the colon can lead to thin stools. cancer in the rectum can lead to a sense of incomplete evacuation. severe constipation. by blocking the colon hardened stool can lead to the same problems as colon cancer. carbohydrate (sugar) malabsorption. carbohydrate or sugar malabsorption is an inability to digest and absorb sugars. the most well-recognized malabsorption of sugar occurs with lactase deficiency (also known as lactose or milk intolerance) in which milk products containing the milk sugar lactose lead to diarrhea. the lactose is not broken up in the intestine because of the absence of an intestinal enzyme lactase that normally breaks up lactose. without being broken up lactose cannot be absorbed into the body. the undigested lactose reaches the colon and pulls water (by osmosis) into the colon. this leads to diarrhea. although lactose is the most common form of sugar malabsorption other sugars in the diet also may cause diarrhea including fructose and sorbitol. fat malabsorption. malabsorption of fat is the inability to digest or absorb fat. fat malabsorption may occur because of reduced pancreatic secretions that are necessary for normal digestion of fat (for example due to pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer) or by diseases of the lining of the small intestine that prevent the absorption of digested fat (for example celiac disease). undigested fat enters the last part of the small intestine and colon where bacteria turn it into substances (chemicals) that cause water to be secreted by the small intestine and colon. passage through the small intestine and colon also may be more rapid when there is malabsorption of fat. endocrine diseases. several endocrine diseases (imbalances of hormones) may cause diarrhea for example an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) and an underactive pituitary or adrenal gland (addison's disease). laxative abuse. the abuse of laxatives by individuals who want attention or to lose weight is an occasional cause of chronic diarrhea.,what are common causes of chronic diarrhea?,['diarrhea'],wmd

after vasectomy the testes continue to make sperm. when the sperm cells die they are absorbed by the body much like unused sperm in a nonvasectomized man. nevertheless many vasectomized men develop immune reactions to sperm although current evidence indicates that these reactions do not cause any harm. ordinarily sperm do not come into contact with immune cells so they do not elicit an immune response. but vasectomy breaches the barriers that separate immune cells from sperm and many men develop anti-sperm antibodies after undergoing the procedure. this has given rise to concern on the part of doctors and researchers because immune reactions against parts of one's own body sometimes cause disease. rheumatoid arthritis juvenile diabetes and multiple sclerosis are just some of the illnesses suspected or known to be caused by immune reactions of this type. immune reactions can also contribute to the development of atherosclerosis the clogging of arteries that leads to heart attacks. in the late  after a study of  monkeys showed an increased risk of atherosclerosis in vasectomized animals doctors became concerned that vasectomy might increase the risk of heart disease in men. other more persuasive research results however indicated that these concerns were not warranted. in particular one study found no evidence that vasectomized men were more likely than others to develop heart disease or any other immune illnesses.,are there immune reactions to sperm after a vasectomy?,"['vasectomy', 'sperm', 'reaction']",wmd

this is a great question. every summer i get asked about poison ivy and poison oak because everyone goes outside. a lot of gardeners end up with it. and people don't realize that pets can actually carry the oils from poison ivy and poison oak in their fur. so when you pat your dog that has been outside the oils may transfer. the first thing you want to do is apply a cool compress to the affected area. you don't want to scratch it because the bacteria in your fingernails can get into your skin and cause an infection. you also want to try drying up the oils as quickly as possible. there are products on the market like ivy dry tecnu and zanfel which are actually soaps that bind to those oils so you can wash them away. this can help promote healing and dry the affected area. if you notice that the area is starting to get red you are running a fever it's spreading or if the rash appears on your face and your eyes you want to go to a doctor right away. you will probably need prescription medication to help slow down the reaction. you can avoid making contact with poison oak and poison ivy by using products like ivy dry tecnu and zanfel before you go out. they can protect you from getting the oils on your skin and ending up with a reaction.,what's the best way to treat poison oak and poison ivy?,['poison ivy'],wmd

if you are consistently taking in more calories than your body requires then you may expect to gain weight over time regardless of whether its calories from protein fat or carbohydrates. some research suggests however that a slightly higher protein diet can actually help you lose weight perhaps by helping you to feel satiated (feel full) to ultimately take in fewer calories. you won't gain weight as the protein ingested will store itself in your body for later use if you go above the amount your body can digest at once but don't expect to see gains in muscle. as long as you keep those saturated and trans fats out of your diet most people will keep a steady weight.,if i do not exercise and eat a lot of protein from yogurt and protein shakes would that make me gain weight? . i am ' and  lbs,"['protein', 'yogurt', 'exercise']",wmd

"when it comes to carbs we generally divide them into two groups: refined and unrefined. some people refer to these as ""bad carbs"" and ""good carbs "" respectively. in general refined carbohydrates are less valuable nutritionally than unrefined (whole) carbs. so a list of unrefined (whole) carbohydrates might include: all raw frozen or canned vegetables (though canned vegetables can contain excessive salt) all raw or frozen fruit (without added sugar) all whole grains (brown rice whole wheat pasta) all whole or canned beans be careful with potatoes. white (and red-skinned golden etc. ) potatoes can cause blood sugar to spike after eating. also be careful with so-called ""whole grain"" breads. read bread labels carefully or buy from a bakery that grinds its own grain. a simple way to evaluate bread is by its mass (weightiness) in your hand. if a bread feels heavy and dense it's probably a good whole-grain loaf. when it comes to fruits some contain more natural sugars than others. grapes are very sugary and shouldn't be a first choice for people with diabetes for example. canned fruits often contain a lot of added sugar so again read labels carefully. of course remember sugar of any kind is a carbohydrate. refined sugars including granulated (white or brown) sugar and powdered sugar is not good in excess. watch for hidden sugars in prepared foods and beverages. good for you for trying to improve your diet. eating a variety of fresh vegetables fruits and whole grains is good for your health. wishing you well! the mayo clinic website has great info and detailed food lists for diabetics etc. should be able to find what you want there also. elizabeth has given you good info. i'm a type  diabetic and can validate what she advises. the more ""processed"" a food item is. the worse it is for us. read the label. those ""whole grain breads"" use processed wheat (white) flour as a base with enough whole wheat flour and often molasses for coloring. luckily i was raised by my grandparents in the late 's and 's on a farm and learned how to eat and cook from the basics. you should learn that if you want to survive diabetes. old-fashioned rolled oats will become your best friend during a sweet attack. i've found that homemade white cornbread is relatively non-offensive (believe-it-or-not). and don't waste your money on sucralose. it doesn't sweeten diddly when cooking plain old walmart aspartame works just fine. good luck",give me a list of grains fruits veggies beans that are rich in good carbohydrates.,"['grains', 'fruit']",wmd
the reason why a prescription maybe dosed  hours is that's what was done in the studies and that's how we know the drug works and how it's going to be effective. so if you extend that timeframe the drug may not work as well you may not feel better because the drug needs that constant blood level in your system. so in the beginning once every  hours you are taking it faithfully it creates what we call steady levels. if you tend to forget a dose or take it a lot later you might actually break up that steady dose of the medication. and therefore that could lead to an increase in side-effects or do not help in infection or blood pressure or something else. so you really want to adhere to the dosing schedule that's on that particular prescription bottle. if you have any questions ask your pharmacist.,if my prescription says twice-a-day or every  hours can i take it even if there is more than  hours in between?,[],wmd

congratulations! it sounds like you are doing an excellent job with your lifestyle changes. diet and exercise are the cornerstones of treating both heart disease and diabetes. but at the same time there are many studies that show that taking statins after a heart attack can actually help prevent future heart attacks as well. a major study called the care trial showed that people who were on statins for at least  years after a heart attack were less likely to need further procedures such as bypass surgery or stents. they were also less likely to die from heart disease. statins can help keep plaque from building up in the arteries including those around the heart. in some cases they can actually cause a regression of the plaque. a statin may also help stabilize this plaque so that it is less likely to break and cause a blood clot. a blood clot in an artery on the heart wall is what causes most heart attacks. it is very important that you work closely with your doctor. your lipid levels and other risk factors should continue to be carefully monitored. talk to your doctor about any concerns you have about your medications. working together you will be able to come up with a long term treatment plan that is right for you. keep up the great work!,i had a heart attack  year ago how long can i expect to carry on taking statins and is there an alternative. i am a  year old male who was diagnosed at the same time as a type  diabetic which i now control with my diet and change of lifestyle and no longer take the medication. i have a bmi of .  after losing  kilos and i exercise daily.,"['heart attack', 'diabetes', 'exercise', 'diet']",wmd

"the research is mixed on the effect of exercise on cholesterol. some studies show that exercise helps lower it while others do not. when exercise does lower cholesterol the effect may be what researchers consider statistically significant but clinically it may drop only a few percentage points and not enough to lower cholesterol into a healthy range. you might consider making a deal with your doctor where you agree to try three months of regular exercise and attention to your diet to lower your cholesterol and if the change at three months isn't enough to put the value in a healthy range then you can discuss how to proceed with your physician. you should know that the side effects of statins are easy to monitor not everyone gets side effects and they are effective medications. as for the type of exercise to lower cholesterol most of the research involves aerobic exercise so walking jogging biking swimming dancing and all cardio machines at the gym count. how much aerobic exercise you need to do or how hard it should be is unknown but aim for five or more days per week for at least  minutes at an intensity of approximately % to % of your maximum heart rate. consistency is important if you try the three-month experiment so plan carefully. set a weekly exercise plan at the beginning of each week and make the plan as realistic and specific as possible. write down the days of the week the time of day the type of exercise and the duration. again be as specific and realistic as possible to increase the probability of doing it. if and when you miss a day get right back on track and always set your weekly plan at the beginning of every week. the good news is that even if your cholesterol doesn't come down with three months of regular exercise you'll certainly get more fit and research shows that other lipid risk factors for heart disease improve with regular exercise. for instance triglycerides almost always drop with regular aerobic exercise sometimes as much as  mg/dl and hdl cholesterol the ""good"" cholesterol rises in some people when they exercise regularly (hdl cholesterol carries ""bad"" cholesterol away from arteries and to the liver where it's removed from the body). good luck with the three-month experiment if you decide to try it. but even if you don't get the results you want and end up needing a statin there are so many other benefits of regular exercise that it's certainly worth the effort.",my doctor prescribed a statin for high cholesterol but i'm afraid of side effects. can exercise help lower my levels?,"['high cholesterol', 'exercise']",wmd

the best way to reduce weight is by regular physical exercise and balanced diet. you can lose weight by reducing your intake of oily food and sweets. it is also important to space your meals in such a way that you have more frequent small meals (and not heavy meals). regular physical exercise in the form of some cardio and strength training will make you fit and strong. sleep and hydration are equally important when you try to lose weight. ensure that you take lots of fluids and that you get at least - hours of sleep per day. medicine to lose weight: as a doctor i never really recommend my patients to take medicines to lose weight. only one drug is approved for use in india- orlistat. if you really want to take it you can take tablet orlistat  thrice a day (after your  major meals). as i have seen in practice and also research results say that orlistat does not produce too much change in weight. it shows just a small percentage of weight loss when coupled with low-calorie diet and exercise. and orlistat has its own share of side effects: fatty/oily stool oily spotting intestinal gas with discharge a feeling of needing to have a bowel movement right away increased number of bowel movements or poor bowel control. rare but serious side effects can occur: symptoms of liver disease (such as persistent nausea/vomiting severe stomach/abdominal pain dark urine yellowing eyes/skin) symptoms of kidney stones (such as back pain pain while urinating pink/bloody urine). bottom line: i do not recommend medicines for weight loss. i can make a good diet chart and exercise regimen for you if you would like to follow up in which case you will have to get back to me with your details- your daily food routine your work timings your daily sleep cycle the kind of exercises you prefer etc. i hope that answers your question. revert back to a fitness expert online --> <link>,suggest me any medicine and guide me reduce weight.,['reduce weight'],ic

left untreated depression can have far reaching effects on both your and your babys health. women who are depressed are less likely to take proper care of themselves. for instance they may not eat a healthy diet or may skip doctors appointments. plus women who are depressed may be more likely to take part in risky behaviors such as drinking alcohol smoking or taking drugs during pregnancy. all of these actions can lead to potentially serious health problems for the baby including miscarriage preterm birth and low birth weight. untreated depression can also take a toll on family dynamics. that includes your relationship with your spouse and other children. if you have older kids they need you to care for them. for some pregnant women regardless of their mental state it can take all the energy they have to care for themselves. add depression to the mix and the suffering can become intolerable for everyone. if depression is preventing you from caring for your family you may need to stay on your antidepressants during this vulnerable time. its important to keep the risks associated with antidepressant use in pregnancy in perspective. all pregnant women have an average % risk of having a baby with any type of birth defect in most cases. when researchers say antidepressants may increase the risk of certain birth defects they are talking about just a slight increase. so even if you take an antidepressant during pregnancy the overall risk of your baby having a problem is still very low.,what are the risks of not treating depression during pregnancy?,"['depression', 'pregnancy']",wmd

firstly congrats on being independent and living on your own. its a big step but a great one. and at times yes you may feel down or irritated but this can all be helped! your anxiety can also be controlled and personally i think you should be doing this through eating the right foods including lots of raw fruit and vegetables dairy free milk such as oat milk soy milk almond milk or if you do not like that at least low or no fat milk. cut out on all processed foods that contain presertitives flavours or flavor enhancers artificial colors added sugar and high salts. this all has effects on the body and is un-natural. just changing what you eat will help your thought processes. decent exercise is also a great way to relieve anxiety and depression. doing good will make you feel good! and lots of good un-interupted sleep is very important too. at least - hours. i dont think the zoloft is doing you any good. these are synthetic chemicals that do more damage to your head and body in the long run. join a yoga class or do some volunteer work. getting out and meeting people will make you feel good. try to learn something new everyday and keep your mind active. don't let bad thoughts get in the way of enjoying this precious life you have. hope this helps you in some way <positive_smiley> keep positive!,i need help with my anxiety. i have borderline personality disorder. i recently moved out on my own; i am miserable. my anxiety is the worst it has ever been. i can feel myself getting more depressed. i am already on zoloft but that doesnt help at all anymore. i am so edgy and it hurting my relationships with everyone around me. please help! i don't know how much longer i can stand all of this. i want to be a successful adult and be able to take care of myself but everyday it doesnt seem like i am ever going to be able to,"['anxiety', 'borderline personality disorder', 'movement', 'pain']",wmd

medicine is used to treat some food allergies. medicines to treat a severe allergic reaction or an anaphylactic reaction are packaged in a prescribed allergy kit. for mild allergic reactions people often try nonprescription medicines first. you can try prescription medicines if nonprescription medicines fail to control allergy symptoms or cause drowsiness or other bothersome side effects. medication choices medicines used to treat a severe allergic reaction include: epinephrine. epinephrine is given as a shot. it acts quickly to stop the further release of histamine and to relax the muscles that help you breathe. antihistamines. antihistamines block the action of histamine during an allergic reaction and help improve symptoms such as itching and sneezing. corticosteroids. these medicines help reduce inflammation. medicines used to relieve mild food allergy symptoms include: antihistamines and corticosteroids for hives gastrointestinal symptoms or sneezing and a runny nose. bronchodilators for asthma symptoms. bronchodilators relax the airways of the lungs making it easier to breathe. what to think about medicines that treat symptoms of food allergies can have side effects. they are typically used for short periods and are discontinued as soon as symptoms are resolved. the best way to avoid symptoms is to avoid the food you are allergic to. read all food labels and be aware that sometimes food allergens are called by other names on food labels. there is no medicine that you can take before eating a certain food that will reliably prevent an allergic reaction to that food. allergy shots (desensitization therapy) for food allergies are considered experimental and are not recommended. a recent small study of a medicine for peanut allergy showed promising results. the medicine called an anti-ige drug binds to the antibodies (ige) released during an allergic reaction to peanut.  a larger study is under way to find out whether this medicine is safe and effective for people who have peanut allergies. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,what medications and treatments are available to treat food allergies?,"['food allergy', 'drug']",wmd

it is true that the more severe the degree of obesity the greater the odds of type  diabetes. that's because the excess body fat fuels insulin resistance in the muscles and organs. there may be adverse hormonal effects on the beta cells as well. after years of insulin resistance the beta cells wear down to the point where prediabetes or full type  diabetes occurs but only in a certain fraction of indiviiduals with obesity. we don't fully understand why some people with obesity are at risk for diabetes while others can be obese their whole lives without getting it. the answer is likely in the genetics but we don't know which genes confer protection or susceptibility. similarly some thin people develop type  diabetes despite minimal insulin resistance. again the answer is in the genes but we don't know which genes.,why is it that obesity doesn't always cause type  diabetes?,"['type 2 diabetes', 'obesity']",wmd

the only way to lose weight is to take in fewer calories than you burn. a vegetarian diet doesnt necessarily mean you will lose weight. a lot of very fattening foods are vegetarian such as desserts french fries candy and snack bars. usually deciding to be a vegetarian is more about a philosophy than losing weight. the basics of achieving and maintaining a healthy weight are the same for vegetarians and nonvegetarians; you need to count your calories and exercise. lean meats are healthier and lower in calories than meats that are fatty. talk to the butcher in your grocery store about which are the leaner meats. beef that is labeled prime choice or select is usually lower in fat. leaner cuts of beef include tenderloin round and sirloin. ground beef for hamburgers will have the percentage of lean meat on the label so choose those with % or higher lean meat. for chicken buy the white meat from the breast and take off the skin. fish is another great alternative to lean meats to get high quality protein. cod flounder haddock salmon tilapia trout and tuna are excellent choices. seafood is another alternative and includes shrimp scallops lobster and crab. the best diet is one that you can stick with. limiting your food choices isnt necessary to lose weight. take the good from each diet plan. try to include dried beans used in vegetarian diets into several meals per week. they are a great source of protein and are loaded with fiber. put yourself on an exercise plan to help with weight loss. remember that losing weight slowly is healthier. learning to eat healthy is a lifestyle change and it doesnt happen overnight.,is a vegetarian diet efficient for weight loss? or a diet that limits meats? . . is a vegetarian diet efficient for weight loss? . . what about a diet that restricts the quantity of meat or that only allows quality (lean) meat? . . does lean meat only mean fish? . . thank you,"['weight', 'fish', 'meat', 'diet', 'weight loss']",wmd

i'm very sorry you're going through this. i strongly suggest you make an appointment with your doctor to have this situation evaluated. many conditions can cause a frequent urge to pee and the source of the problem also can depend on whether you're a man or a woman. your doctor can perform a physical examination to determine the right treatment for the cause of your overactive bladder and urinary incontinence symptoms. meanwhile you may feel more confident by using pads or briefs designed for urinary incontinence. that way if you don't make it to the bathroom you'll have a pad to catch the pee instead of getting everything wet. i wish you all the best with this!,i have frequent uncontrollable urge to pee and many times cant make it to the bathroom,[],wmd

your husband should be tested for sleep apnea right away! he is probably sleep deprived and his heart health is at risk. does he snore? and like snort and wake himself up? that's because he has stopped breathing. there are many reasons for sleep apnea. also if he has a cold or sinus congestion or cluster headaches that can cause these symptoms. but i am thinking he has sleep apnea. after i found out that i have sleep apnea and started treatment on my c-pap machine it took about a week to get used to having the mask on but within  weeks i noticed that i was thinking more clearly and had way more energy! call an ear nose throat doctor and they will get you started!,my husband sometimes seems drunk but says he hasn't had any alcohol. what else can cause slurred speech and droopy eyes? . when he gets like this he swears he isn't drunk but his speech is slurred his eyes are droopy or bloodshot and he is slightly unsteady. maybe he's just exhausted. he gets very little sleep probably  hours a night average. but i have this nagging doubt and it's really causing problems for us. could it be anything else? he's also very overweight and has high blood pressure (controlled by medication) and is on cholesterol-lowering medication and diuretics. thank you so much for the help.,"['drinking', 'high blood pressure', 'eyes', 'cholesterol', 'corpulence']",wmd
the best time to eat after taking insulin depends on three major factors. first the type of insulin you are taking the type of food you are eating and your current blood glucose level. there are two major types of insulin taken before meals rapid acting and short acting. rapid acting insulins include lispro (humalog) insulin aspart (novolog) and insulin glulisine (apidra). its generally best to inject these insulins up to  minutes before you plan to eat. for the short acting insulins humulin r and novolin r the timing is  to  minutes prior to the meal. if you wait longer than these times you run the risk of having a low blood glucose level. the type of food also impacts the timing of insulin. carbohydrates have the most effect on glucose levels. meals that are high in fat slow down the absorption of carbohydrates. so eating a pizza which has a lot of fat may not affect your glucose level as quickly as eating a bowl of cereal. protein usually has a small effect on your blood glucose levels. thirdly your blood glucose level prior to eating is important. having a low blood glucose level and then taking insulin and waiting to eat may cause your blood glucose level to drop even further. if your blood glucose level is high before you eat you may need to add extra insulin as recommended by your doctor to compensate for the high blood glucose level. in terms of how much to eat that depends on your weight your dietary needs and your insulin to carbohydrate ratio. this ratio is how many grams of carbohydrates one unit of insulin covers. this is a very individualized number that your doctor will decide when prescribing insulin to you. the important point is to talk with your doctor nurse educator and dietician about the timing of eating and insulin. keep a diary of the different foods you like to eat so that you can gain insight into what happens when you eat that meal. be sure to mark down the grams of carbohydrates in the meal so your doctor can evaluate your insulin to carbohydrate ratio. check your blood glucose level  hours after eating to see what effect the meal has on your glucose level. remember that many other factors affect your reaction to insulin such as exercise a cold and stress. diabetes is a chronic disease and the more you understand about the factors affecting you the better your glucose control will become.  mins. i think you should have your meal first then straight after take your insulin. then you can work out how much insulin to take depending on how much you ate and also what you ate. bbbb an hr later.,when to eat after insulin injection? also how much to eat after your insulin injection?,"['insulin', 'injection']",wmd

congestive heart failure is generally a progressive disease with periods of stability punctuated by episodic clinical exacerbations. the course of the disease in any given individual however is extremely variable. factors involved in determining the long term outlook (prognosis) for a given patient include: the nature of the underlying heart disease the response to medications the degree to which other organ systems are involved and the severity of other accompanying conditions the person's symptoms and degree of impairment other factors that remain poorly understood with the availability of newer drugs to potentially favorably affect the progression of disease the prognosis in congestive heart failure is generally more favorable than that observed just  years ago. in some cases especially when the heart muscle dysfunction has recently developed a significant spontaneous improvement is not uncommonly observed even to the point where heart function becomes normal. heart failure is often graded on a scale of i to iv based on the patient's ability to function. class i is patients with a weakened heart but without limitation or symptoms. class ii is only limitation at heavier workloads. class iii is limitation at everyday activity. class iv is severe symptoms at rest or with any degree of effort. the prognosis of heart failure patients is very closely associated with the functional class. an important issue in congestive heart failure is the risk of heart rhythm disturbances (arrhythmias). of those deaths that occur in individuals with congestive heart failure approximately % are related to progressive heart failure. importantly the other half are thought to be related to serious arrhythmias. a major advance has been the finding that nonsurgical placement of automatic implantable cardioverter/defibrillators (aicd) in individuals with severe congestive heart failure (defined by an ejection fraction below %-%) can significantly improve survival and has become the standard of care in most such individuals. in some people with severe heart failure and certain ecg abnormalities the left and right side of the heart don't beat in rhythm and inserting a device called a biventricular pacer can significantly reduce symptoms.,what is the long-term outlook for patients with congestive heart failure?,['congestive heart failure'],wmd

well thermage is indeed an fda approved procedure that super heats the skin and specifically the collagen which is one of the main building blocks of skin and theoretically would form new younger and tighter collagen. now that process doesnt take place over night. and so the manufacturer has advised physicians and secondarily patients that they will not see an immediate result. the hoped for result may take  or  or  months to achieve. that process is probably not achieved the success that we had hoped it might. again by observation because the patients have to accept that when they are employing a new technology. we are all learning about it so the first kid on the block may be satisfied and may be disappointed. i think to this point were a little bit disappointed. now that said there havent been any complications. i think most patients consider the significant complication to have hit their wallet because they didnt get much for their money. and its not inexpensive. it can be several thousand dollars because it means a visit in the operating room the doctors time the technical the cost of the technology. so again not harmful but not really delivering the goods. certainly not a substitute for a surgical facelift. and many services technologies kind of position themselves as less invasive less traumatic less expensive less everything quote facelift but the answer is they cant match the proven record of a surgical procedure. its just not possible by having the skin treated by a beam of light to get rid of a saggy chin and jowls and the product of many years of ages and perhaps even some dissipation.,what is your opinion of thermage?,[],wmd

most helpful answer a few facts: tetanus is rare but if you got it it is nearly % fatal. tetanus is usually not caused by surface wounds but deeper tissue wounds. tetanus vaccine is % protective for  years -- a small price to pay for this type of insurance. i am pleased that you cleaned the wound carefully since tetanus shots do not prevent wound infections. although i cannot see if your finger needed stitches or not if it is over  hours it cannot be sutured. it will need to heal from the inside out. you need to use an antibacterial ointment or cream and observe for signs of infection (redness pus increased tenderness swelling) and see your medical provider if this happens. i vote for the tetanus shot. if it doesn't help you for this wound it least it will help you over the next ten years. your pharmacist may be able to give it to you if this service is provided there. if you decide not to get it that would need to be your decision.,i got a semi-deep cut slicing my finger on a can of wet cat food. how important is a tetanus shot really? . it filled with the wet food but i quickly washed it with soap sprayed it with anti bacterial spray & put a bandage on it. this was yesterday morning. tonight i can still pull the wound apart & see into the layers of skin. i was told by a pharmacist when i asked what i could use to seal my skin shut to get a tetanus shot. i thought that was more for outside wounds like rusty nails & dirt. does a can a cat food really need one or is it just to cover bases but most likely i will be fine?,[],wmd

doctors can use several types of medicine to treat paget's disease. although it is not possible to cure paget's disease with them they can make the disease inactive and may reduce complications. medicines such as bisphosphonate and calcitonin slow the breakdown and rebuilding of bone tissue. you can use over-the-counter medicines such as acetaminophen nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) or other pain medicines to treat bone pain. medication choices medicines that slow the breakdown and rebuilding of bone tissue include: bisphosphonates which are usually the first medicines used to treat paget's disease. calcitonin which is usually given by injection. your doctor probably will prescribe calcitonin if you cannot tolerate bisphosphonates or if they have not been effective in treating your symptoms. what to think about you may need to take medicine for several weeks before symptoms of paget's disease improve. some medicines control the disease and its symptoms only while the person is taking the medicine. soon after the medicine is stopped symptoms may come back. your doctor may recommend medicine for paget's disease even though you have no symptoms. medicines prevent the rapid breakdown of bone tissue and may decrease the chance of complications of paget's disease. an oral bisphosphonate such as alendronate ( fosamax ) or risedronate ( actonel ) generally is used first. if the side effects are too much for you you can try intravenous pamidronate ( aredia ) or zoledronic acid ( reclast ). webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,what medications and treatments are available to treat pagets disease of bone?,"[""paget's disease"", 'drug']",wmd

the only way to know for sure you're pregnant is with a pregnancy test. but there are early symptoms of pregnancy that can alert you to the fact that you may be pregnant and should have a test. spotting and cramping. breast changes. fatigue. nausea (morning sickness). missed period. it's important to keep in mind that the symptoms may be caused by other things besides being pregnant. so the fact that you notice some of these symptoms does not necessarily mean you are pregnant. the only way to tell for sure is with a pregnancy test. some women are so attuned to their body and the changes it undergoes with pregnancy that they seem to know from the start they are pregnant. other women though have no suspicion they are pregnant until they miss their first period which is perhaps the most widely recognized early sign of pregnancy.,could i be pregnant?,['pregnancy'],wmd
yes it definitely can. spinal stenosis refers to narrowing of the spinal canal. the spinal canal is a narrow opening within the vertebrae (bones of the spine) that allow the spinal cord to pass through. when the spinal canal becomes narrow it puts pressure on the roots of the nerves that run from the spinal cord to various body parts. in the lumbar spine (which is located in the lower back) the nerves transmit sensation from the legs to the brain. if a nerve in the lumbar spine is pinched it can cause the legs (or a single leg) to transmit pain signals. if you've been diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis your doctor should be able to treat your pain in the short term and suggest some ways to deal with the problem in the long term. i suggest you consult your doctor to find out what your options are. i hope you feel better soon!,can lumbar spinal stenosis it cause severe pain in your leg?,"['lumbar spinal stenosis', 'leg', 'pain']",wmd

i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. girl problems can be very annoying! have you actually had your yeast infection diagnosed by a medical professional? as i'm sure you know many conditions can produce symptoms that feel and look like a yeast infection. for example bacterial vaginosis comes to mind -- and that conditions requires treatment with antibiotics. sexually transmitted infections also can mimic symptoms of a vaginal yeast infection. so it's important for you to get a definitive diagnosis before you try any interventions. if in fact you are experiencing a yeast infection then there are many over-the-counter treatments for it as well as a prescription oral medication. you can try any of those. you also can try these tips for avoiding a vaginal yeast infection: don't douche. this can disrupt the balance of natural bacteria inside the vagina. let your crotch breathe. don't wear garments that restrict air flow to your nether regions. perpetual dampness of the vulvar area can promote an overgrowth of yeast. don't sleep in your underwear. when you have a bowel movement always wipe from front to back. a common cause of both utis and yeast infections is contamination by fecal material due to poor hygiene techniques. in other words if you transfer poop toward your vagina and urethra it can cause infections. don't allow your sex partner to insert anything in your anus and then insert it in your vagina. again this can transfer fecal matter to an area where it causes problems. eat products (like certain yogurts) that contain live acidophilus cultures or take an acidophilus supplement. this may help both your gut and your vagina maintain a proper balance of flora (bacteria) for good health. get your blood sugar levels checked. chronic vaginal yeast infections may be a sign of undiagnosed diabetes or pre-diabetes. by the way did you get your uti properly diagnosed? only antibiotics can clear up a urinary tract infection. the studies remain cloudy regarding whether cranberry actually helps the symptoms a uti or not but it certainly won't cure one. wishing you well!,"yeast infection help. so i've had problems ""down there"" the past few months. first it started with a uti (urinary tract infection) and it was horrible. i drank a whole thing of cranberry juice because i know that helps a lot. and for about the past  weeks now i've been making myself drink nothing but water and maybe lemonade. but i've been staying away from soda. now currently i have a yeast infection. i'm just getting very annoyed that i keep having problems like this. what can i do to prevent both of these?","['yeast infection', 'urinary tract infection', 'drinking', 'cranberry', 'juice']",wmd

"ridiculous! most of the men and boys on this planet are uncircumcised. just the way god made them. uncircumcised boys do not wet the bed more than circumcised boys and going through this unnecessary and painful procedure for a -year old is not a cure for his bedwetting. the only exception would be if his foreskin was so tight that he is having difficulty urinating and his foreskin is ""ballooning"" from trapped urine when he pees. even then there are ways of fixing a tight foreskin without circumcision. there are medications that can help. assuming you can get them in your country. that can really really help. desmopressin (ddavp) is what i have used for years for bedwetting and in my opinion works like a charm in the vast majority of bedwetters. one major cause of bedwetting is the lack of adh (anti-diuretic hormone). a hormone that reduces the amount of urine that is produced at night. if a young boy does not have enough of this natural hormone the body will continue to produce urine at the same rate is day-time. not something that is desirable. desmopressin replaces this hormone. clearly his doctor is suggesting a surgery and i absolutely do not agree with this unorthodox approach. consider seeing a child endocrinologist. even if you have to travel to a larger city or at least suggest desmopressin as a non-surgical approach. your son needs help. bedwetting is embarrassing and it is not his fault.",circumcision as a cure for bed wetting. we are currently living in a developing country. our -year-old son wets his bed almost every night. we used to have a beeper that would trigger when he was starting to urinate at night but the device broke down and we cannot get one here. it seemed effective though. . now a phycisian here suggests to perform a circumcision in order to solve the bed wetting issue. i'm wondering if this really is a standard solution and if there is scientific research proving this?,"['urination', 'circumcision']",wmd

eggs have been in the news a lot recently and for once it isnt the cholesterol that is making people fearful over eggs. this time its salmonella enteriditis which appears to be able to infect the ovaries of chickens and can cause their eggs (usually the egg white) to be contaminated from the inside out. the eggs in question have been traced to a couple of high-volume egg producers in iowa. but this outbreak aside keep in mind that there are over   egg-related salmonella illnesses each year in the u. s. according to fda estimates. most salmonella cases dont require a doctor visit and can resolve in one to three days according to the fda but its the  percent of cases that are severe require hospitalization and are cause for great concern. i dont know about you but i dont even want to experience the one to three-day salmonella poisoning. there is some hope that there will be a lower risk of salmonella from eggs in the future. new fda regulations which went into effect in july this year are expected to cut the number of salmonella-carrying eggs by  percent. egg-laying hens are thought to get salmonella from a couple different ways and it aint pretty thats for sure — through germs carried by flies and from eating the excrement of rodents that get into their feed. i personally am not afraid to use and enjoy eggs in my recipes and meals. i just automatically cook my eggs completely. i also use half eggs and half pasteurized egg substitute or egg white when making egg-based entrees to bring down the saturated fat and cholesterol. and i try to purchase cage-free eggs (even better when they are cage-free and higher omega-) for a variety of reasons. what else can you do? * use the eggs you buy within four weeks. * keep eggs refrigerated at least to  at all times. store eggs in their carton in the center of the refrigerator instead of removing them and storing them in the door which may not be cold enough. * to substantially reduce the risk of salmonella do not eat raw eggs and cook your eggs and egg dishes completely (the white and yolk will be firm. ) * wash your hands cooking utensils and food prep surfaces thoroughly after being in contact with eggshells and raw eggs. * dont eat recalled eggs or products containing recalled eggs. * discard cracked or dirty eggs. * dont keep eggs warm or at room temperature for more than two hours. * refrigerate unused or leftover egg-containing foods as soon as possible.,how should i store and prepare eggs safely?,['electrogastrogram'],wmd

"there is research that shows that barbecuing can be hazardous to your health. but don't worry there is still a way to have your ""barbecued steak"" and eat it too. the health problem lies in the meat. research has discovered two cancer-causing (carcinogenic) byproducts associated with barbecuing red meat poultry lamb pork and fish. the first is a carcinogen called heterocyclic amines (hcas). the national institute of health department of health and human services included hcas on its reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen list. hcas are formed due to the high temperatures occurring when meat is overcooked or char-grilled. studies have shown that when hcas were fed in the diet rodents developed cancers in many organs including the colon breast and prostate. research is still underway to determine if this applies to humans as well. the second carcinogen associated with barbecuing is polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs). they are formed when fat drips onto the coal or hot surface. the smoke carries the pahs to the food. they can also form directly on the food when it is charred. the recipe for healthy barbecuing is to follow some simple tips: don't get too hot: try to avoid overcooking food by precooking it in the microwave or oven so it won't be on the barbecue as long; keep the heat down on the grill and flip the food frequently to prevent overcooking on one side; buy thinner cuts of meat so that they don't take as long to cook; and test the meat with a thermometer to see when it's ready. the usda recommended safe minimum internal temperatures are: steaks & roasts -  degrees f fish --  degrees f. pork --  degrees f. ground beef --  degrees f. chicken breasts --  degrees f. whole poultry --  degrees f. trim the fat: go for leaner cuts of meat; cut as much fat off of the meat when possible; and flip your food instead of stabbing it with a fork to avoid the fat dripping onto the coal. take time to marinate: some research has shown the ingredients (especially vinegar) in marinades act can actually protect the meat and reduce the chances of carcinogenic compounds forming. one study found that a beef steak marinated with teriyaki sauce had a % and % lower hca level at  minutes than the unmarinated steak and that lower levels of hca were also observed in meat marinated with turmeric-garlic sauce. keep it clean: keep the oil and grease off your grill by turning up the heat to high and closing the lid for about  minutes.",what are potential health problems that can be connected to eating barbecued and smoked meats?,"['meat', 'smoking']",wmd

eat more! thats what nearly all weight gain strategies come down to although its not always quite that simple. people with certain health conditions are at risk for poor nutrition: celiac disease inflammatory bowel disease cystic fibrosis cancer chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection many others. people who are losing weight with these conditions should ask their doctor for a referral to a nutritionist. a low appetite is often part of the illness and eating higher-calorie foods is advised. some of these illnesses can also cause poor absorption of nutrients and testing and treatment can address this. in any medical condition if muscle mass has been lost its important to include protein in the diet to help rebuild muscles. healthy young men and teenage boys often want to gain weight usually in the form of muscle. their challenge is usually eating enough to keep up with the calories theyre burning in their active lifestyles. to gain weight by building muscle its necessary to eat a lot of protein. weight-training athletes may require  to  grams of protein or more daily. healthy lean protein sources include chicken eggs fish and beans. whey protein supplements can be mixed in with drinks soups or sauces. soy protein supplements are not advised except in small amounts because some of the soy may be converted to estrogen in the body. its best to talk to your doctor or a nutritionist before starting a high protein diet if you have any health conditions especially liver or kidney disease. gaining weight can be just as difficult as losing weight for some people. an essential component of weight gain is eating enough calories each day. a registered dietitian will be able to calculate and estimate your calorie needs using the harris-benedict equation or there are also websites available to help you do this on your own. in order to gain weight theoretically you need to eat more calories than what would normally be necessary for you to maintain your current weight. keep in mind its still important to eat healthy and make the right food choices. dont use this as an excuse to eat whatever you want because youll end up gaining fat that way. youll need to exercise too especially by incorporating strength-building exercise which will help to build muscle mass to add to your weight. the surgeon general recommends at least two days per week of strength training exercising each major muscle group. of course the more exercise that you do the greater the benefits you should notice. keep in mind however that you do need rest to allow your muscles to recover. make sure that youre getting enough protein in your diet as well. only protein has the essential amino acids necessary for muscle growth and development. a registered dietitian can also help you to determine your protein requirements. ask your doctor before taking protein supplements or beginning a high protein diet. ive recommended a good article for more information: <link>,how can i gain weight?,['weight gain'],wmd

i am sorry to know that despite the best efforts you are not responding with current antidepressants and there are active symptoms. i suggest the following treatment given a diagnosis of diabetes with depression. tablet duloxetine (duzela m)  mg in the morning and  mg in the evening. the reason for recommending this medicine is because it is quite effective for pain symptoms associated with diabetic neuropathy along with depression. tablet aripiprazole (arpizol)  mg in the morning. although it comes from an antipsychotic group of medicines my purpose here is to augment the action of antidepressants while addressing anger associated with depression. tablet lonazep (clonazepam) can be continued as per the current level if there is adequate sleep. in case sleep has been an issue despite the medicines i will recommend upping the dose of lonazep to .  mg at bedtime. regarding vilazodone i think it should be removed as it is causing intolerable side effects. also this particular antidepressant has little role in pain associated with neuropathy and i think duloxetine will be a better option. there is need to stop tobacco. this is because many of the medicines mentioned above have poor efficacy when tobacco is consumed. you need to consult your diabetes doctor as poor control of diabetes could be a significant reason for the poor response. consult your specialist doctor discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. in case you have more questions feel free to write back to me. for further queries consult an andrologist online --> <link>,can diabetes make my hands itchy and numb?,['diabetes'],ic

i strongly urge you to contact your doctor as soon as possible. by going off plavix you have put yourself at a much greater risk of experiencing a life-threatening blood clot. no one should discontinue a prescription 'blood thinner' without consulting their doctor first. you don't say why you were prescribed plavix (clopidogrel) but it's often given to people after they've had a heart attack recent stroke angioplasty procedure or if they have peripheral vascular disease. these conditions put a person at an increased risk of developing a blood clot that travels to the lungs or possibly the brain causing problems breathing or a stroke. to answer your question omega- oils are thought to have 'blood-thinning' properties but they are in no way a substitute for a prescription anticoagulant like clopidogrel. in fact a  study showed they had no effect on coagulation or platelet function after surgery. clopidogrel works by making your platelets (a type of red blood cell that enables blood to clot) more slippery so they don't stick together easily. this effect reduces the chances of blood clotting and traveling to the lungs or brain. again i urge you to contact your doctor and discuss this issue with him or her. at three months without plavix you could very well have a blood clot brewing. your healthcare provider will want to examine you and perhaps run some tests to make sure you're safe. there are many other types of anticoagulants available for your use besides clopidogrel if that product causes side effects. wishing you well!,can taking omega  dea have the same results as taking plavis. i was taking plavix for at least  years and have never felt good.  months ago i stopped taking plavix and feel better. my question is does taking  fish oils have the same affect on the blood.,"['fish', 'oil']",wmd

under the health reform law a small business health insurance exchange has been set up where you can shop for insurance if you wish to provide coverage for your employees. in texas you would access that through healthcare. gov. small firms in which workers have lower incomes can qualify for tax subsidies to help cover the cost. as a point of clarification plans sold both on and outside of the marketplace are sold by private insurers but to take advantage of tax credits you need to buy insurance through the marketplace. if you're not already offering insurance and your employees have household incomes that would allow them to qualify for subsidies (about $ for an individual and $ for a family of four) they may actually get insurance at a lower cost by going it alone and buying individual rather than small business coverage through the federal marketplace. there's no simple answer to your question unfortunately. you may want to enlist the help of an insurance agent in your area who can help walk you through the various options before you and decide which direction will do your employees the greatest service. to find an agent in your area you can search on nahu. org.,which one would be cheaper? private insurance plan or marketplace insurance plan. please advice me. i have a small business with  employees in texas. what are the options in marketplace insurance plans for small businesses. can i buy group insurance plans. which one would be cheaper? private insurance plan or marketplace insurance plan. please advice me.,['insurance'],wmd
"the answer to your question depends on a lot of information you didn't include. i'll try to give you some general guidance. in the united states levothyroxine is a regulated drug. you can't obtain it without a prescription. so i'm wondering if you mean you took someone else's prescription medicine (which is always a bad idea) or if you obtained some sort of ""natural supplement"" type product that claims to contain levothyroxine (or a related product dessicated pork thyroid). levothyroxine is a thyroid hormone. thyroid hormones are important for regulating many body functions. people who have had their thyroid gland removed (or destroyed with radioactive iodine) or who don't produce enough thyroid hormone generally receive therapy with supplements like levothyroxine. no one should take levothyroxine (or any other thyroid hormone) unless they have been diagnosed with a thyroid disorder. taking unneeded thyroid hormone can cause problems with the thyroid gland and can interfere with many bodily functions. so in short taking a single  dose of levothyroxine on a one-time basis probably is no cause for alarm. but do not take this medication unless it has been prescribed for you by a health care provider. hope this helps! it was given in a pass med for a weekend trip and was not for me. i took the medication then realized it was not mine. pharmacy put someone elses in the bag. i cannot find where there is any real adverse reactions to a single dose of it and since i have not had any of the alergic reactions noted on the label i figure i am ok. dont want to make a trip back to doctor if not necessary. thanks for information.",took a dose of  levothyroxine can this cause harm? . should i be concerned since it is a natural hormone produced? effects if any it may cause?,['hormone'],wmd

the short answer is this: your father should continue taking all these medications until a doctor tells him he can stop. perhaps it would help to explain what some of the medications are for. as you indicated the metformin is for blood sugar issues. part of the reason your dad's blood sugar is controlled is because he is using this pill. he should follow up regularly with a doctor regarding his diabetes and should get a hemoglobin  blood test every  months at the lab. the telmisartan is indeed a blood pressure pill. again the reason your dad's blood pressure is controlled is at least partly due to taking this pill. it's very important he not stop or decrease his blood pressure medication after having an angioplasty. clopidogrel is a blood thinning medication. if your dad had stents placed in the arteries of his heart during the angioplasty the doctor may want to keep him on clopidogrel for a year or longer. this medication helps prevent the blood's platelet cells from sticking to the stents and causing a blood clot. atorvastatin is a medication to help keep your dad's cholesterol within normal limits. excessive cholesterol in the blood can cause clogged arteries and heart problems. sorbitrate treats a couple of different heart conditions including angina (chest pain). so as you can see your dad needs all of these medications to help manage his diabetes blood pressure and heart problems. he should not stop or reduce his use of these medications. if you have any questions about this please follow up with his doctor. best to you both!,how long should one continue medications after angioplasty? what are the side effects of prolonged use of certain drugs? . my father aged  yrs undergone angioplasty september last and he is still continuing some medicines daily he is currently taking. glycomet gp- (metformin hydrochloride ip  mg) -tab daily on empty stomach (he is a diabetic blood sugar under control). telmisartan ip  mg  tab daily (blood pressure under control). clopidogrel tablets ip   tabs ( times daily after meals). atrovastatin tablets ip - mg  tabs ( times daily after meals) sorbitrate - mg  tabs  times daily after meals,"['stomach', 'angioplasty', 'blood pressure', 'meal', 'drug']",wmd

bipolar disorder has no cure but can be effectively treated over the long-term. it is best controlled when treatment is continuous rather than on and off. in the step-bd study a little more than half of the people treated for bipolar disorder recovered over one year's time. for this study recovery meant having two or fewer symptoms of the disorder for at least eight weeks. however even with proper treatment mood changes can occur. in the step-bd study almost half of those who recovered still had lingering symptoms. these people experienced a relapse or recurrence that was usually a return to a depressive state. if a person had a mental illness in addition to bipolar disorder he or she was more likely to experience a relapse. scientists are unsure however how these other illnesses or lingering symptoms increase the chance of relapse. for some people combining psychotherapy with medication may help to prevent or delay relapse. treatment may be more effective when people work closely with a doctor and talk openly about their concerns and choices. keeping track of mood changes and symptoms with a daily life chart can help a doctor assess a person's response to treatments. sometimes the doctor needs to change a treatment plan to make sure symptoms are controlled most effectively. a psychiatrist should guide any changes in type or dose of medication.,what can people with bipolar disorder expect from treatment?,['bipolar disorder'],wmd

a recent editorial in one of the major medical journals discussed the implications of additional post-residency fellowship training. fellowships are the medical professions finishing schools.  typically they go for one or two years after completion of a standard residency which itself can be up to seven years after medical school. therefore it is a significant investment by a young physician who already has spent much of his or her youth in training and education. fellowships are very important because as the world of medical practice — in all specialties — becomes more and more complex particularly because of new technology and science it is impossible to master all areas of the core specialty. that important editorial was written by a prominent educator in the specialty of head and neck surgery my core specialty. he noted that of the  trainees finishing residencies in head and neck surgery in approved american residencies  percent were pursuing additional fellowship training. that is an impressive percentage. the doctor felt that there were several reasons for that quest for more knowledge and experience. first and most laudable the desire for excellence. next the reality that many young doctors are now reluctant to go into private practice because of the expense the hassles of eternally battling insurance companies and more unproductive government regulation and meddling. tied to that they are going to be drawn to working at universities and other mega-sized multi-specialty medical centers. particularly with those seeking an academic affiliation a fellowship represents a great entry onto ones resume. however the most important thing is whether or not fellowship training for some percentage of surgeons is good for patients. my stance is that it is very important. the best surgeons within narrow niches of given specialties have generally had fellowship training. here is an example from another specialty. orthopedic surgery has so many divisions that it has long operated fellowship programs. after all there are orthopedic surgeons who sub-specialize in spine surgery hand surgery pediatric orthopedics and sports medicine. now there are orthopedic surgeons who do only joint replacements. a subset of that group are the superspecialists in artificial hip placement or artificial knee replacement. this is good for patients because it brings to them the most narrowly focused finely tuned specialty talent. whether you are considering having shoulder replacement or a hernia repair or cosmetic nasal plastic surgery you are generally in the best hands when those hands have been trained by a fellowship.,how much specialty training should physicians have?,[],wmd

there are theoretical reasons why patients identified with hiv around the time they are first infected (primary acute infection) may benefit from the immediate initiation of potent antiviral therapy. preliminary evidence suggests that unique aspects of the body's immune response to the virus may be preserved by this strategy. it is thought that treatment during the primary infection may be an opportunity to help the body's natural defense system to work against hiv. thus patients may gain improved control of their infection while on therapy and perhaps even after therapy is stopped. at one time the hope was that if therapy was started very early in the course of the infection hiv could be eradicated. most evidence today however suggests that this is not the case. consequently early treatment is not likely to result in a cure although other benefits may still exist. the current recommendation is that patients with primary infection should be referred to clinical studies where the potential role of therapy can be discussed and further explored. if emotional or social situations make adherence to such treatment questionable however the patients are clearly better off delaying therapy.,"should patients with the ""flu-like"" or ""mono-like"" illness of primary hiv infection be treated?","['flu', 'hiv', 'mononucleosis', 'infection']",wmd

the diagnosis of congestive heart failure is most often a clinical one that is based on knowledge of the patient's pertinent medical history a careful physical examination and selected laboratory tests. a thorough patient history may disclose the presence of one or more of the symptoms of congestive heart failure described above. in addition a history of significant coronary artery disease prior heart attack hypertension diabetes or significant alcohol use can be clues. the physical examination is focused on detecting the presence of extra fluid in the body (breath sounds leg swelling or neck veins) as well as carefully characterizing the condition of the heart (pulse heart size heart sounds and murmurs). useful diagnostic tests include the electrocardiogram (ecg) and chest x-ray to detect previous heart attacks arrhythmia heart enlargement and fluid in and around the lungs. perhaps the single most useful diagnostic test is the echocardiogram in which ultrasound is used to image the heart muscle valve structures and blood flow patterns. the echocardiogram is very helpful in diagnosing heart muscle weakness. in addition the test can suggest possible causes for the heart muscle weakness (for example prior heart attack and severe valve abnormalities). virtually all patients in whom the diagnosis of congestive heart failure is suspected should ideally undergo echocardiography early in their assessment. nuclear medicine studies assess the overall pumping capability of the heart and examine the possibility of inadequate blood flow to the heart muscle. heart catheterization allows the arteries to the heart to be visualized with angiography (using dye inside of the blood vessels that can be seen using x-ray methods). during catheterization the pressures in and around the heart can be measured and the heart's performance assessed. in rare cases a biopsy of the heart tissue may be recommended to diagnose specific diseases. this biopsy can often be accomplished through the use of a special catheter device that is inserted into a vein and maneuvered into the right side of the heart. another helpful diagnostic test is a blood test called a bnp or brain natriuretic peptide level. this level can vary with age and gender but is typically elevated from heart failure and can aid in the diagnosis and can be useful in following the response to treatment of congestive heart failure. the choice of tests depends on each patient's case and is based on the suspected diagnoses.,how is congestive heart failure diagnosed?,['congestive heart failure'],wmd

i have a better idea: stay home. there are a handful of causes of ear pain. an ear infection is infected fluid behind the eardrum in a space called the middle ear.  the medical term for this is otitis media  sometimes called acute otitis media to stress that it begins suddenly. acute otitis media almost always occurs after a child has had nasal congestion for a few days most typically from a cold. if your child complains of ear pain and hasnt been congested it probably isnt an ear infection. even if your child really does have an ear infection you dont necessarily have to rush to have it checked. an antibiotic isnt thefirst thing he needs. in fact it may not be necessary at all! so what should parents do about a weekend or middle-of-the-night earache? if the child looks miserable and sick he really should be seen right away. if the pain is more mild or moderate give him a dose of pain medicine like ibuprofen or have him hold a warm heating pad against the ear. if the pain subsides with these simple measures an emergency trip to the doctor or er is not necessary. what happens if you delay starting antibiotics for an ear infection? as long as the child isnt super-miserable its ok to wait a bit. ear infections it turns out usually go away on their own. waiting a day or two if your child is reasonably comfortable is a good way to avoid extra costs hassle and antibiotics. note that this advice is meant for children older than two who can speak and describe what theyre feeling. if your child is younger you should call your doctor for more specific advice on whether you ought to wait a few days before being seen on the weekend.,its sunday and my  year old son has an earache. should i take him to the er or an urgent care clinic?,"['toddler', 'emergency room']",wmd

spondylolisthesis is a condition where one vertebra slips forward over an adjacent vertebra. it typically occurs in the lumbar spine and is the result of an injury to or degeneration of one or both of the facet joints of the bone. facet joints help support the weight of the spine and control movement (extension flexion and twisting). symptoms of spondylolisthesis although not present in everyone (it depends on the degree of slippage) can include pain in the low back thighs or legs. pain is due to inflammation of the facet joint or compression impingement or shear forces on a disc. the condition is also associated with muscle spasms weakness and tightness (low back and hamstrings). exercises that emphasize proper body mechanics and stabilize the spine during movements like flexion and extension and stretches for the low back and hamstrings should be prescribed. pelvic tilts abdominal crunches with legs on a chair leg raises (with knees bent and abdominal muscles contracted the bent knee is lifted) and gluteal piriformis and hamstring stretches can all be helpful. proper ergonomics while seated at a desk proper posture while standing and safe lifting technique should all be taught. exercises to avoid are forward bending without the knees bent and abdominals tight bending forward while twisting and any other movement that causes pain. exercises should be individualized depending on the symptoms type and grade of spondylolisthesis. no exercises should be performed if the individual has symptoms and exercises that cause pain should be stopped immediately. you should speak with your client's doctor before you prescribe any exercises and i recommend that you become familiar with the anatomy and biomechanics of the injury as well as the effects of different exercises on the spine.,how is spondylolisthesis and stenosis affected by exercise and what restrictions are necessary?,"['spondylolisthesis', 'exercise']",wmd

"i have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. i have struggled and struggled and even though i'm on daily meds i still have trouble. this answer is from my own experience and from my heart. people are genetically predisposed to bpd. that means we're born with it and will die with it. there is no cure. so the first way it affects us over time is that it is a constant ""cross to bear "" for our entire lives and we either cope or literally die. suicide risky behavior or pissing off the wrong person during an episode of rage are some threats to our existence. i have been dangerously near suicide four times - i remember them especially because i was serious. another way it affects us over time - it's like a failing marriage. things are ok a lot of the time but the more and more you argue with the same person about the same thing the frustration compounds and you would do anything just to make this so-and-so go away. well you can get out of a bad marriage. i've been aware of my disorder for five years now and i'm  so this is as far as my experience goes. i don't know how i will be at   . but from the way it looks now my strategies will have to change and become more potent if i am to survive. it is literally a constant battle except that your sworn enemy and foe is inside your head. and it's smart. it's similar to our smartphones and apps now the ones that ""learn"" your search preferences and even your voice over time. it finds a way to use your own thoughts against you. for example if i am going through a mixed manic-depressive episode i believe (with all my heart! ) that no one loves me that i am a failure that i will never be ok and that i should just take myself out. it is literally temporary insanity! i am a healthy vibrant attractive career-oriented single mother of a beautiful daughter with a fully loving and supportive family a therapist who loves me and stays on standby and i have goals. i am a normal person. but during those times i am absolutely certain that i am alone that i will fail at my goals like so many times before and that i have no reason to go on living. its the disease. it talks to me in my head and it's hard to differentiate between the sane voice and the insane one until the episode is over. then i'm perfectly ok. just like that. lastly things that are affected over time are relationships with friends family and romantic relationships and jobs. we struggle with dealing with ourselves so of course others who have to deal with us struggle too. i have had to re-start my career  times because i would build up a great rep at a job and then eventually get fired for emotional instability. so that's where the ""failure"" thoughts come from - how do i know it won't happen again? just yesterday i couldn't stop crying for four hours at work even while interacting with my co-workers. i cannot control or guide when or how intense it will be when it hits. hope this helps!",how does bipolar disorder affect someone over time?,['bipolar disorder'],wmd

the answer to this question lies in your individual menstrual cycle. depending on the brand (you need to read the box) you can take a home pregnancy test as early as a day after you miss your period. some tests claim you can test  to  days before you miss your period but testing too soon can give you a false negative result. it may be better to wait the few extra days to see if you miss your period and then test. for best results i suggest taking the test first thing in the morning when your urine is most concentrated. home pregnancy tests measure the level of human chorionic gonadatropin (hcg) in your urine. this hormone is produced in great quantities beginning shortly after fertilization of an egg occurs. by taking the pregnancy test first thing in the morning you ensure any hcg in your urine is very concentrated and easy for the test to detect. so step one: wait until you miss your period. step two: home pregnancy test. hope this helps! i had an accurate positive home test  weeks after conception with my  child so yes it is possible. if it comes back positive best thing to do is go to the doctor and get it confirmed. thats what i did,if you have unprotected sex on nov  is it possible to tell with a home test that you are pregnant on the ?,['pregnancy'],wmd

your age may be one of the more important determinants in whether hpv testing is recommended. among younger women infections with hpv are very common. often a younger womans immune system is able to fight off an hpv infection. thus some type of pap smear may be the best choice for screening. by contrast if a women in her  or older has a positive test for high risk hpv it might be assumed that she has a more worrisome persisting infection. % of cervical cancers occur in unscreened or under-screened women (demay ). so you do need to get screenings but the type and interval of screening is going to depend upon your age and probably high risk hpv screening tests. liquid based paps do reduce the number of false negative results in the majority of women. ask your gyn if your pap will be a liquid type and if it will be reviewed by automated and human screeners. if you have one of the high risk hpv subtypes by dna testing request a copy of the results for your files so you will know which subtype you have. even if you have received a hpv vaccination you should will still need a pap smear. the recommended interval is still under discussion.,is a pap smear or hpv test recommended for women?,"['human papillomavirus', 'pap test']",wmd

i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds very uncomfortable. it's true that antibiotics continue working for some time after you take the last dose. the length of time they keep working depends on the exact type of antibiotic. however at five weeks post-antibiotics you can rest assured they have long since exited your system. and it's very good news that a chest x-ray showed your lungs are clear of fluid. as you probably know pneumonia is an infection of the lungs. this is usually caused by a virus though it can also be caused by bacteria. the problem with either type of pneumonia is that it inflames and irritates your delicate lung tissue. and this irritation can linger even after the infection is gone. this probably explains why you continue to feel symptoms even though you no longer have pneumonia per se. i would suggest you continue to follow up regularly with the doctor who treated you. he or she should be able to better explain the factors that may be continuing to cause you discomfort. you deserve an explanation and your doctor is the person in the best position to tell you. wishing you well!,how long after finishing antibiotics for pneumonia should it take to feel better? . i finished the antibiotics for pneumonia  weeks ago and i am still having chest pain and tightness. i had a repeat chest x-ray  weeks ago and it was clear. i am currently on flovent ( a day) and ventolin as needed (averaging - a day) to help with these symptoms but i feel like i haven't improved since i finished the antibiotics.,"['antibiotic', 'pneumonia', 'chest', 'pain', 'tightness']",wmd

the exact amount of protein and fat you need depends on the number of calories you need each day which in turn is based on factors such as your height and activity level. protein should make up about % to % of your total calories a day. so in general women need about  grams of protein each day. thats honestly not hard to get especially if you eat meat. protein is good for satisfying hunger so its safe to include a little more if that helps. a -ounce piece of meat has  grams of protein. even a cup of beans has  grams. and a cup of yogurt has  grams. fat should make up % to % of your total calories. so if youre eating  calories per day you want to eat less than about  grams of fat. and of course make sure it's the good fat sources that you're eating like nuts avocados and olive oil. food labels are a good way to see how many grams of protein and fat are in your food. but keep in mind the -calorie diet thats often referred to on food labels is too much for most women unless youre very physically active.,how much protein and how much fat is a woman supposed to consume every day?,[],wmd

the typical fertile window is - days long and it is just before you ovulate. ovulation typically occurs about  days before the next menstrual period starts. so in a  day cycle ovulation should occur around day  and your fertile period is between cycle days -. the fertile window is determined when the cervical mucous becomes more elastic and receptive to sperm. some women notice that is is more slippery when they wipe during this time. men need to ejaculate once within a week of the fertile window to increase the number of younger sperm that will be in the ejaculate during the fertile window and have intercourse at least once during the fertile window. the day the opk turns positive is probably the last day of the fertile window so i would try a little earlier. don't worry about the semen leaking out of the vagina. that is normal. only about % of the sperm are expected to get into the cervical canal which is a reservoir and will release sperm slowly for days after intercourse to ensure that sperm are present when the egg is released.,if i am trying to get pregnant when should i have sex if the ovulation predictor kit tells me what day i ovulated? . and what can i do keep the sperm inside me longer?,"['sexual intercourse', 'pregnancy', 'ovulation', 'ovulation prediction kit']",wmd

most people being screened for tuberculosis get the tuberculin skin test also called the purified protein derivative (ppd). a small amount of harmless disintegrated tuberculosis protein is injected under the skin on the forearm. within a few days most people who have been previously infected with tuberculosis will develop a raised firm (indurated) area on the arm. redness and bruising dont count. the cdc recommends different cutoffs for a positive tb skin test depending on a persons risk for tuberculosis. for people with no risk factors for tuberculosis an indurated area  millimeters across is considered positive. as little as  millimeters of induration is a positive test for someone with an impaired immune system or a known tb exposure. a trained reader needs to interpret the tb test. most people with a positive tb skin test dont recall symptoms of tuberculosis. they may have a normal chest x-ray as well. nevertheless they still likely have a small number of tuberculosis bacteria hiding somewhere in the lungs. they have about a % lifetime risk of developing full-blown tb called reactivation tuberculosis. to prevent this antibiotic treatment may be recommended after a positive tb test depending on age and other medical conditions.,what does a positive tb test look like?,[],wmd

my short answer to your question is this: any time you've got a lump on the head and you're worried about it it's ok to go see the doctor. a major point i want to make is this: never ever take a blood-thinning pain reliever such as advil (ibuprofen also goes by the name motrin) aspirin (brand names excedrin bufferin anacin etc. ) or naproxyn (brand names alleve naprosyn) after hitting your head. these medications can cause bleeding which could turn a not-so-serious injury into a very serious injury. i'm glad your husband seems to be doing fine and it's always better for the swelling to be on the outside of the skull than the inside. however if your husband has dilated pupils (the black dots at the center of his eyeball) slurred speech or loss of balance you should take him to the doctor right away. these can be signs of a more serious head injury. with a bruise the size you're describing it's likely your husband has suffered a concussion. these may range from mild to severe. again if you have any concerns about the extent of his head injury your safest bet is always to seek medical attention. since it's been more than  hours since the accident you don't need to rush to the emergency room. but you definitely can get evaluated at an urgent care facility or ask your primary care provider to work your husband in for an appointment soon. best wishes to you!,how do i know when a head injury is bad enough to see a doctor? . my husband hit his head at work. right side lower part of the head. its swollen from the middle back of his head to the right ear. has a terriable headache took advil and did ok sleeping. when he woke up this morning his head was pounding as if he has a migrain. not sure if i should worry or let it go as if it was a normal bump on the head. how do you tell the difference between a knot or a we need a doctor knot. i dont feel fluid. swelling is ecactly the same. not bigger or smaller.,"['migraine', 'headache', 'ears', 'head', 'head injury']",wmd

the symptoms of cystic fibrosis vary from person to person and over time. sometimes you will have few symptoms. other times your symptoms may become more severe. one of the first signs of cystic fibrosis (cf) that parents may notice is that their baby's skin tastes salty when kissed or the baby doesn't pass stool when first born. most of the other signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis develop later. they are related to how cystic fibrosis affects the respiratory digestive or reproductive systems of the body. respiratory system signs and symptoms people who have cystic fibrosis have thick sticky mucus that builds up in their airways. this build-up of mucus makes it easier for bacteria to grow and cause infections. infections can block the airways and cause frequent coughing that brings up thick sputum (spit) or mucus that's sometimes bloody. people who have cystic fibrosis tend to have lung infections caused by unusual germs that don't respond to standard antibiotics. for example lung infections due to bacteria called mucoid pseudomonas are much more common in people who have cystic fibrosis. an infection caused by this bacteria may be a sign of cystic fibrosis. people who have cystic fibrosis have frequent bouts of sinusitis an infection of the air-filled spaces behind your eyes nose and forehead. frequent bouts of bronchitis (bron-ki-tis) and pneumonia (nu-mo-ne-ah) also occur. these infections can cause long-term lung damage. as cystic fibrosis gets worse you may develop more serious complications such as pneumothorax (noo-mo-thor-aks) or collapsed lung; or bronchiectasis (brong-ke-ek-ta-sis). some people who have cystic fibrosis also develop nasal polyps (growths in the nose) that may require surgery. digestive system signs and symptoms mucus that blocks tubes or ducts in your pancreas and prevents enzymes from reaching your intestines causes most digestive system signs and symptoms. without these enzymes your intestines can't fully absorb fats and proteins. this can cause ongoing diarrhea or bulky foul-smelling greasy stools. intestinal blockage also may occur especially in newborns. too much gas or severe constipation in the intestines may cause stomach pain and discomfort. a hallmark of cystic fibrosis in children is poor weight gain and growth. these children are unable to get enough nutrients from their food due to the lack of enzymes to help absorb fats and proteins. as cystic fibrosis gets worse other complications may occur such as: pancreatitis (pan-kre-a-ti-tis). this is a condition in which the pancreas become inflamed which causes pain. rectal prolapse. frequent coughing or problems passing stools may cause rectal tissue from inside you to move out of your rectum. liver disease due to inflamed or blocked bile ducts. diabetes. gallstones. reproductive system signs and symptoms men who have cystic fibrosis are infertile because they're born without a vas deferens. this is the tube that delivers sperm from the testicle to the penis. a woman who has cystic fibrosis may have a hard time getting pregnant because of mucus blocking her cervix or other cystic fibrosis complications. other signs symptoms and complications other signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis are related to an upset of the balance of minerals in your blood. cystic fibrosis causes your sweat to become very salty. as a result your body loses large amounts of salt when you sweat. this can cause dehydration (a condition in which your body doesn't have enough fluids) increased heart rate tiredness weakness decreased blood pressure heat stroke and rarely death. cystic fibrosis also can cause clubbing and low bone density. clubbing is the widening and rounding of the tips of your fingers and toes. it develops late in cystic fibrosis because your lungs aren't moving enough oxygen into your bloodstream. low bone density also tends to occur late in cystic fibrosis. it can lead to a bone-thinning disorder called osteoporosis.,what are the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis?,['cystic fibrosis'],wmd
you bring up two important issues regarding the treatment of adhd with medications. first the difficulty finding the right combination of medications when co-existing conditions are present and second the use of adhd medications during pregnancy. when choosing a medication to address adhd symptoms it is extremely important to keep co-existing conditions in mind and not make them worse with treatment. some co-existing conditions such as mild depression/demoralization or anxiety may be the result of untreated adhd and will improve once the adhd is treated. however some stimulants may make anxiety (or depression) worse particularly those in the amphetamine class so its best to avoid those if you can if you have anxiety. in addition other therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) have been shown to improve symptoms of anxiety in persons with adhd. this treatment can be a particularly useful adjunct for those with anxiety/self-esteem issues or who can not take medications for whatever reason. that brings us to the second issue pregnancy and medications used to treat adhd. basically the stimulants are not recommended for use during pregnancy in order to avoid any possibility of damage to the developing fetus. there have been no studies done in humans but cardiac defects have been seen in animals given very high doses of stimulants during pregnancy. if you are contemplating getting pregnant it is best to discuss this with your prescribing physician and ob/gyn and wean off any stimulant treatment.,im a -yr-old female with adhd depression and anxiety. willl my adhd be affected by my planned ivf? . i can't find the right medication/treatment plan for me.,"['anxiety', 'attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'depression']",wmd

a fever is not your body fighting an infection. anything that heats up your body including heat and induces sweating causes a fever. fevers cause heat exhaustion and heat stroke as heat heats up the body inducing sweating wich causes water to be ejected from the body. you may induce a fever and prove this by simply visiting a steam room and when your sweating check your temp youll have a fever. you may also go out jogging and see when your hot and sweating you have a fever with a fever thermometer. if you do either for long periods youll eventualy drop from exhaustion enjoying before that mild to severe dehydration symptoms heat exhaustion and heat stroke and possible mild heart attacks. cardio excersize and steam rooms have been around for centuries inducing fever and not cured any disease other than treat obesity. your heartrate can generate heat and cause a fever by pumping friction wich happens during jogging just like shaking a pop can or rubbing your hands generates warmth. make sure you maintain bodyweight during a fever. if food poisioning is suspect having a person stomach pumped and an enema given may be needed if fatigue sets in. fluid calories are better during a fever its important to maintain heartrate as lowering your heartrate also induces fatigue. if a fever is starting with no fatigue water may be ok. its important to keep dry and keep cool (keeping dry to avoid chills). humans thrive in cool temp climates of - degrees thier is little life in deserts do to heat heat starves an area of water. for children its important that children playing maintain thier bodyweight during excersize/play and eat and drink and take rest breaks and normalize thier heartrate reducing sweating. if people have to loose weight then i recommend simply getting out and walking bringing food fluids before or during thier walk to avoid dehydration with rest breaks. obesity causes fever and dehydration by carrying around - lb weights. you may simulate obesity by carrying a backpack of -+ lb barebell weights and grow it daily and see what affects that has on your health. weather and activie levels can affect weight loss. people eat drink and rest to maintain thier heartrate and energy levels. in a virus or poision a fever is a response to excess blood volume wich causes your heart to pump harder and faster generating heat. you may simulate this by giving an unnecessary blood transfusion wich will likely cause a fever and may cause a mild heart attack so i wouldnt advise it. water causes weight gain at / lb a cup its a myth its zero caloric. overdrinking from dehydrationcan cause excessive urination in addition to lowering your heartrate further so cold water if a fever has started with no fatigue otherwise fluid calories.,how do you break a fever in a toddler?,"['fracture', 'fever', 'toddler']",wmd

most helpful answer there has been a backlash against low fat diets leading people to go in the opposite direction embracing diets high in saturated fat diets. the truth is diets low in saturated fat won't reduce heart disease risk if the saturated fat is being replaced with refined carbs. this decreases hdl (good cholesterol) and can increase triglycerides and the blood sugar response. but as both of the review studies below demonstrate when saturated fat in the diet is replaced with plant and fish sources of fat (omega- fatty acids and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats) it decreases heart disease risk -- hdl increases and ldl (bad cholesterol) decreases. <link> <link> this is basically the mediterranean diet -- low in saturated fat high in fruits and vegetables and healthy fat sources like olive oil and nuts. while the french may have diets higher in saturated fats they also tend to be leaner walk more and eat other heart healthy foods like fruits and vegetables. while the evidence continues to evolve there isn't enough to recommend a diet high in saturated fat to reduce heart disease. yes some propit change to lipid and make your belt bigger. see more here hi for those who have interest in saturated fat have a good read through this one site there is lots on it. <link> just copy link into google to the www. to open and read. should help some of you. good luck our old belief was that saturated fat have the ability to raise cholesterol levels and give us heart attacks but s everal recent review studies that combined data from multiple other studies found that there really is no link between saturated fat consumption and heart disease h owever it's a fact that replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats reduced the risk of cardiac events by %. so it's always better to stay away from a fatty body. i had a very fatty body from my childhood it self but by doing a plastic surgery procedure at montreal omar fouda neel clinic i reduced overall body fat and there by weight. i think the links you have are pretty awesome. sf's are great just really need to have them in moderation i would think.,could you provide a few links to the major studies showing excessive saturated fat is unhealthy? . this website and the american heart association continue to recommend a diet low in saturated fat. but the current buzz on the internet is that there is really little evidence for that position. in fact france eats a diet high in saturated fat yet has a low rate of deaths from heart disease (<link> <link> ). can i see links to the original studies showing sf is harmful?,"['heart', 'diet', 'grief', 'heart disease', 'vision']",wmd
catastrophic plans are plans under which an individual pays the vast majority of out-of-pocket expenses until he/she reaches the plan's deductible. some pros of catastrophic coverage are: catastrophic plans offer more affordable monthly premiums for an individual who might otherwise not purchase insurance coverage at all coverage under such a plan as suggested by its name will at least protect them in the event of a catastrophic event such as a car accident or serious illness that could result in hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills which would plunge many people into bankruptcy the major con of catastrophic coverage is that it covers very few out-of-pocket expenses before the deductible is met and the deductibles under these plans can be quite high. so these plans may not be ideal for individuals who have substantial out-of-pocket expenses. this would include those who take a significant number of prescription drugs on a regular basis and/or find themselves visiting a physician frequently.,what are some of the pros and cons of buying a catastrophic plan?,[],wmd

the most common form of neutropenia in infants and young children is transient neutropenia with or following a viral illness. it resolves itself within  weeks. if it lasts longer than that or the child is very ill then a full workup for neutropenia would be recommended. in infants aged  weeks to  year the lower limit of the normal neutrophil count is /l. after the first year of life the lower limit is /l as in adults. spontaneous recovery in such cases occurs by age  years and the mean duration of neutropenia is approximately  months. the clinical severity and frequency of infections rather than the severity of neutropenia would be used to determine the further management of the condition. hence you should continue to work with the treating doctors for appropriate medical advice. i hope this helps.,to whom it may concern: my son is  months old and he is on breastfeeding. in his blood analysis which was done in  january  number of neutrophils was . /nl. after that we repeated blood test on  march  and number of neutrophils was . /nl because of that result we did test again in  march  and number was . <negative_smiley>nl. no other symptoms are revealed however according to pediatrician we did following tests: iga igm igg hiv  and copper in blood. currently we have only hiv result and it is negative. please tell me: is it possible in infants to have low number of neutrophils without any obvious reason and can it increase without any additional treatment and in what period of time? thank you in advance.,['blood disorders'],eh

some people do notice that their hair can be thicker and fuller when pregnant and this is a hormonal fluctuation. so what happens is that your hair has three cycles of growth: it has a growing phase a resting phase and a falling out phase. sometimes with the hormones and the changes in pregnancy your hair stays in that growing phase longer. so you have more hair in that growing phase so your hair looks thicker and fuller and grows longer and often is more shiny as well. what happens though is three to four months after pregnancy when those cycle shift back all of a sudden that hair starts to shed as you revert back to your normal hair cycles. so if all your hair grew in the growing phase at the same time and then shifted to the resting phase every two to ten years or so you would go bald completely. but fortunately that pattern is not synchronized. so about % of your hair is growing and % is resting or falling out. so if that patterns shifts you might notice that your hair looks fuller for a while but there is a price to pay on the other side and then it will balance back out. yes mine did. and then after i had my baby girl i lost quite a bit of it <positive_smiley>,does your hair grow thicker while you are pregnant?,['pregnancy'],wmd
most helpful answer i'm not sure i fully understand the question but let me try to cover as many bases as possible. certainly you won't be required to undergo any psychological treatments as a result of the law. unless treatment is court ordered you always have the right to refuse it. if what you're asking is whether you can buy a health plan that does not pay for mental health and substance abuse services the answer is no. there are religious exemptions under the law that would allow you -- if you meet criteria -- to avoid having to buy insurance at all. but there is no way for you to buy an insurance policy and pick and choose the specific benefits that come with it based on your personal belief system.,can one refuse psych treatments under obamacare based on religious preference?,['obamacare'],wmd

"yellowing of teeth is mainly due to one of the following or a combination of these: ) tartar or plaque deposits (soft yellowish deposits) on the teeth. ) calculus deposits (calcified hard deposits) on the teeth. ) fluorosis - internal discoloration of the teeth due to altered fluorine content in the drinking water. you have given an excellent description of the clinical condition of your oral cavity. from your history it is very clear that the yellowness of your teeth is due to plaque and calculus deposits. plaque as you have mentioned is yellowish and creamy. this gets partially removed with brushing. calculi are hard deposits either yellowish greenish or sometimes blackish in color. they are firmly attached to the teeth and do not go off with brushing or tooth powder. even the abrasiveness of the tooth powder cannot remove the calculi. during childhood due to improper brushing there are chances of plaque and calculus formation over the teeth. because children at this age tend to be playful and do not concentrate on oral hygiene. ""tooth worms"" as people say are nothing but bacteria that affect the teeth. these bacteria act on the teeth and cause demineralization of the teeth and lead to tooth decay and cavities. the lower incisors and canines are more prone to plaque and calculus deposition (v shaped deposition in accordance with the tooth morphology) due to inability of us to reach the inner sides of these teeth while brushing. at this age of yours these deposits may be due to: ) improper brushing technique. ) brushing only once a day. ) malalignment of your teeth. ) crowding of your teeth (due to inadequate spacing in between the teeth). ) if you are having any prosthetic teeth (crown bridge removable appliances). ) if you are undergoing orthodontic treatment (wire braces). dental scaling is the procedure that removes plaque and calculi. but it does not mean that these deposits will not come back again. continuous oral hygiene maintenance after scaling is mandatory to prevent recurrence of plaque and calculi. hence scaling is not a wastage of money it is an investment to prevent one's teeth and gums from infections and thereby increase the life of the teeth. so a permanent solution for your problem is to follow these steps to maintain oral hygiene: ) brush with toothpaste and brush twice daily. the head of the toothbrush should be angulated in such a way that it reaches all the teeth and all the interior and hidden parts of the teeth. ) use an antibacterial mouthwash only for the time period for which the dentist has prescribed. because long term use of mouthwash itself will cause staining of teeth. ) rinse your mouth thoroughly soon after every meal. ) in case you are wearing wire braces or prosthesis use the specific tooth brushes (orthodontic toothbrushes) to clean the teeth thoroughly well. ) use interdental toothbrushes to clean the minute spaces in between the teeth. ) visit a dentist once in every  months and get a scaling done if necessary. as your doctor has told regular use of colgate toothpaste is sufficient. sensodyne toothpaste is not needed for you since it is used for hypersensitive teeth. glodent toothpaste helps in stain removal and it can be used if extrinsic stains are present on the teeth. it does cause teeth whitening. regular use of mouthwash is not essential. you can use hexidine mouthwash for about two weeks and then stop it. bleaching is the procedure used to remove internal or intrinsic staining of the teeth which is not required for you. and finally pearl white color of the teeth indicate that they are unhealthy. teeth which are slightly yellow without any deposits on them are said to be healthy. hope this answer helps you. take care. consult a dentist online for further follow up --> <link>",my teeth are yellow. is scaling only a temporary process to clean the teeth?,['dental scaling'],ic

hi found you this info below from <link>#tcm:- there are two ways of giving brachytherapy for prostate cancer. small radioactive seeds can be inserted into the tumour and left to release their radioactivity slowly. this is sometimes known as low-dose rate treatment. the seeds are not removed and the radiation gradually fades away over about six months. all the radioactivity is absorbed by the prostate so its safe for you to be around other people. as a precaution youll be advised to avoid long periods of close contact with children and pregnant women. your specialist will give you more information about the precautions you should take. alternatively the seeds can be placed inside special catheters that have been inserted into the prostate gland while youre asleep in an operating theatre. the seeds are put into the catheters for a set period of time and are then taken out. this is known as high-dose rate treatment. after the treatment the catheters are removed and no radioactive material is left in the prostate gland. do hope this is what your looking for in the way of help. good luck,how successful is brachytherapy as a cure to prostate cancer? . for stage  of prostate cancer,['prostate cancer'],wmd

i have long loved the flavor and versatility of mushrooms in cooking. i was even more thrilled with these fungi (aka fun guy) when i learned of the great nutritional benefits. mushrooms have long been studied as antioxidants — literally books can be written on their nutritional benefits. suffice it to say that when its raining or snowing outside there is something beyond comfort in a bowl of mushroom soup! not only are mushrooms packed with nutrients incredible antioxidants low-cal fat-free and cholesterol-free they are delicious! my go to mushroom is a crimini aka baby bella (small portabellos). they look like the white button varieties but they are brown. they have an earthy flavor and are great in everything from salads to soups to pastas to chicken or meat dishes. you can buy them loose in bulk or already sliced for you. simply slice them thin and sauté them in a bit of extra virgin olive oil and garlic with a splash of soy sauce. the water will start to cook out of the mushrooms and you can add to a grilled chicken breast or a burger or piece of fish. by adding chopped fresh cilantro or basil at the end you can even further expand the flavors. if you are using dried mushrooms look for one that has some porcini in it. the flavor is so intense and can elevate the flavors of a recipe instantly. shiitake mushrooms are another favorite of mine. they have a distinct flavor that goes well with asian dishes. i would use a shiitake in a noodle dish that has veggies ginger garlic and soy. they are also great roasted whole and tossed with just a bit of extra virgin olive oil soy sauce and sesame seeds. then top on a steak or serve with wilted spinach as a side dish. i would not use shiitakes in an italian-style dish that has butter or cream.,do mushrooms have nutritional value? which taste the best?,"['taste', 'mushroom']",wmd

"viruses bacteria or (in rare cases) parasites or other organisms cause pneumonia. in most cases the specific organism (such as bacteria or virus) cannot be identified even with testing. when an organism is identified it is usually the bacteria streptococcus pneumoniae. many types of bacteria may cause pneumonia. pneumonia caused by mycoplasma pneumonia is sometimes mild and called ""walking pneumonia. "" viruses such as influenza a (the flu virus) and respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) can cause pneumonia. in people with impaired immune systems pneumonia may be caused by other organisms including some forms of fungi such as pneumocystis jiroveci (formally called pneumocystis carinii). this fungus frequently causes pneumonia in people who have aids. some doctors may suggest an hiv test if they think that pneumocystis jiroveci is causing the pneumonia. you may get pneumonia: after you breathe infected air particles into your lungs. after you breathe certain bacteria from your nose and throat into your lungs. this generally occurs during sleep. during or after a viral upper respiratory infection such as a cold or influenza (flu). as a complication of a viral illness such as measles or chickenpox. if you breathe large amounts of food gastric juices from the stomach or vomit into the lungs (aspiration pneumonia). this can happen when you have had a medical condition that affects your ability to swallow such as a seizure or stroke. a healthy person's nose and throat often contain bacteria or viruses that cause pneumonia. pneumonia can develop when these organisms spread to your lungs while your lungs are more likely to be infected such as during or soon after a cold or if you have a long-term (chronic) illness such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. you can get pneumonia in your daily life such as at school or work (community-associated pneumonia) or when you are in a hospital or nursing home (healthcare-associated pneumonia). treatment may differ in healthcare-associated pneumonia because bacteria causing the infection in hospitals may be different from those causing it in the community. this topic focuses on community-associated pneumonia. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.",what causes pneumonia?,['pneumonia'],wmd

the right colorectal cancer treatment is based on the degree of spreading or stage: cancer that is self-contained inside a polyp can often be cured with a colonoscopy. a snare on the end of the colonoscope cuts the entire cancer out. if colorectal cancer has spread into the bowel wall surgery is needed. part or all of the colon is removed (hemicolectomy or colectomy). once the cancer has spread into the body treatment becomes more complex. it will usually involve chemotherapy or other targeted colorectal cancer treatments. as you can see the treatments get more aggressive and invasive as the cancer spreads. so colorectal cancer prevention is the name of the game.,what are the treatments for colorectal cancer?,['colon cancer'],wmd

early ejaculation is probably one of the most common sexual problems in men. depending on how you define this condition some studies have found that up to % of men suffer from premature ejaculation at some point in their lives. the exact cause of premature ejaculation is not known and treatments focus on the behavioral psychological and medical aspects. here's a lineup of some of the treatments that are available: antidepressants- some can cause a delay in ejaculation. these medications include paxil or zoloft lidocaine creams and other desensitizing creams prolong the time to ejaculation. desensitizing lubricants are available over the counter. the squeeze method developed by masters and johnsons or the stop and start technique are also employed to help with premature ejaculation and help prolong sexual activity. if premature ejaculation causes you anxiety its important to meet with a mental health counselor. seek medical help for early ejaculation since these treatments may help you but part of the treatment plan should be to have a sustained and satisfying sex life. what is ejaculation? ejaculation is the release of semen from the penis following sexual climax. when a man is sexually stimulated the brain sends signals to the genital area through nerves in the spinal cord to contract the pelvic muscles. at the start of this process waves of muscle contractions transport the sperm with a small amount of fluid from the testes through to the vas deferens. the seminal vesicles and prostate contribute extra fluid to protect the sperm. this mixture of fluid and sperm travels along the urethra to the tip of the penis where it is released (ejaculated) at the time of sexual climax (orgasm). doctormens. com you need to put your focus into your woman instead of constantly thinking and worrying about your penis. muscle programs are often activated by our thoughts so if you worry and imagine yourself ejaculating you will lose control and ejaculate. keep in mind that your conscious mind can only focus on one subject at a time. hi! i am  years old. i tried duramale after i suffered from premature ejaculation for many months. i saw the money refund policy so i decided to buy  bottles on <link> since there were no risks. i was very happy about the results even after  weeks but i followed the treatment very strict. this was my secret i guess. i recommend duramale to everyone who suffer from early orgasm. duramale pills can be purchased only online from website through credit card debit card or paypal. for complete details and best price of duramale visit <link> hi! i am  years old. premature ejaculation is more common than you think. up to % of all males experience this in their life-time. i personally overcame my issues with premature ejaculation by following these very helpful tips. if interested please click here: <link> i hope it helps you as well as it did for me.,is there any cure for premature ejaculation? i am  male and ejaculate within  mins. i am not at all satisfied.,"['ejaculation', 'premature ejaculation']",wmd
many women suffer from ibs -- it's not clear whether it is related to menopausal hormone changes or not but it certainly is also very common as we get older. a couple of thoughts that i've learned from my friends who are gastroenterologists. have you tried a fiber-containing product like metamucil or citrucel? many gi folks recommend it and if you haven't it's probably worth a try. another product that many of them recommend for my patients is a fancy probiotic called align -- it's available over the counter and it is supposed to be an excellent bacteria for the intestines. even if you have tried other probiotics it's probably worth a try. another (and more esoteric) thought is evening primrose oil -- there are a couple of papers in the literature from many years ago touting its use in women with pms -- and i have a few patients who tell me it has helped them -- so it's probably worth a try. again finding a good gastroenterologist is a good idea to try to help get you through these episodes -- and again the local county medical society is a good starting place if you don't feel comfortable with your gi doc.,i have ibs alternating between constipation and diarrhea. could it be related to peri-menopause?,"['constipation', 'irritable bowel syndrome', 'menopause', 'perimenopause', 'diarrhea']",wmd

because treatment may damage healthy cells and tissues unwanted side effects are common. these side effects depend on many factors including the location of the tumor and the type and extent of the treatment. side effects may not be the same for each person and they may even change from one treatment session to the next. before treatment starts the health care team will explain possible side effects and suggest ways to help the patient manage them. surgery patients often have a headache or are uncomfortable for the first few days after surgery. however medicine can usually control their pain. patients should feel free to discuss pain relief with the doctor or nurse. it is also common for patients to feel tired or weak. the length of time it takes to recover from an operation varies for each patient. other less common problems may occur. cerebrospinal fluid or blood may build up in the brain. this swelling is called edema. the health care team monitors the patient for signs of these problems. the patient may receive steroids to help relieve swelling. a second surgery may be needed to drain the fluid. the surgeon may place a long thin tube (shunt) in a ventricle of the brain. the tube is threaded under the skin to another part of the body usually the abdomen. excess fluid is carried from the brain and drained into the abdomen. sometimes the fluid is drained into the heart instead. infection is another problem that may develop after surgery. if this happens the health care team gives the patient an antibiotic. brain surgery may damage normal tissue. brain damage can be a serious problem. the patient may have problems thinking seeing or speaking. the patient also may have personality changes or seizures. most of these problems lessen or disappear with time. but sometimes damage to the brain is permanent. the patient may need physical therapy speech therapy or occupational therapy. radiation therapy some patients have nausea for several hours after treatment. the health care team can suggest ways to help patients cope with this problem. radiation therapy also may cause patients to become very tired as treatment continues. resting is important but doctors usually advise patients to try to stay as active as they can. in addition radiation therapy commonly causes hair loss. hair usually grows back within a few months. radiation therapy also may affect the skin in the treated area. the scalp and ears may become red dry and tender. the health care team can suggest ways to relieve these problems. sometimes radiation therapy causes brain tissue to swell. patients may get a headache or feel pressure. the health care team watches for signs of this problem. they can provide medicine to reduce the discomfort. radiation sometimes kills healthy brain tissue. this side effect is called radiation necrosis. necrosis can cause headaches seizures or even the patient's death. in children radiation may damage the pituitary gland and other areas of the brain. this could cause learning problems or slow down growth and development. in addition radiation during childhood increases the risk of secondary tumors later in life. researchers are studying whether chemotherapy may be used instead of radiation therapy in young children with brain tumors. side effects may be worse if chemotherapy and radiation therapy are given at the same time. the doctor can suggest ways to ease these problems. chemotherapy the side effects of chemotherapy depend mainly on the drugs that are used. the most common side effects include fever and chills nausea and vomiting loss of appetite and weakness. some side effects may be relieved with medicine. patients who receive an implant (a wafer) that contains a drug are monitored by the health care team for signs of infection after surgery. an infection can be treated with an antibiotic.,what are the side effects of treatment for brain tumors?,['brain tumor'],wmd

the issue of is it safe to have multiple procedures because they add up in length. and that does have to be taken into consideration. you do have to take into consideration the length of the operation but more importantly the nature of the operation. the reason is that liposuction for example and what we call large volume liposuction has had some percentage of significant complications due to the nature of the procedure where there is just a lot of fluid being sucked out of the body and a lot of fluid being put in for the anesthesia and frankly its a little less scientific than wed like it to be and for that reason the time element of the operation comes into play the volume comes in in other words thats a major operation and if you tack that on at the end of  hours previously with a face lift lets say its probably not always a very good idea. so again this is where common sense comes in and this is where the surgeon has to say you know you need a lot of this and maybe heres where we do have to split it up into two trips to the operating room. so all these factors have to come into play the length of the operation and the nature of the operation and the patients own particular lets say underlying their physiology how they are known to heal. if somebody says well im really a slow healer again you become a little more conservative.,could it be unsafe to have multiple procedures?,[],wmd

keep it dark and quiet and have a routine every evening that consists of quiet time -- maybe a bath reading a book or brushing babys teeth if they have any yet. get them calm and drowsy before putting them in their crib and be consistent -- put them down the same way each time. in the middle of the night shorten your routine. you dont want baby to fall asleep while youre feeding or rocking them though because you want them to figure out how to put themselves to sleep. don't wake them if they do fall asleep especially not in the first month; its impossible to avoid falling asleep during feedings and rockings when theyre that young. but after the first month put them to sleep drowsyif theyre falling asleep when youre nursing for example stop nursing and put them to sleep. if theyre falling asleep too soon try starting your calming quiet routine sooner. also make sure they aren't overtired when you put them to bed. once babies start eating more in the daytime they dont need to wake and eat at night. but dont overfeed to encourage them to sleep through the night. some parents try to push more formula breast milk or baby food on the baby right before sleep and that can backfire. wait until they settle into a pattern where they naturally eat more in the daytime.,how can i get my baby to start sleeping through the night?,['baby'],wmd

i'm sorry to hear you have arthritis. it's certainly a very common ailment. i guess i'm going to assume you're referring to osteoarthritis which is the wear-and-tear disease that makes the joints hurt. this type of arthritis frequently comes on as we get older. just to be clear there's another type of arthritis called rheumatoid arthritis that is an autoimmune disease. but based on your question i'm thinking you're referring to plain old arthritis that hurts worse when the weather gets colder. if that's the case moving from connecticut to virginia probably won't help. while it's true coldness can make the pain of osteoarthritis feel worse virginia probably isn't sufficiently warmer than connecticut in the winter to make much of a difference. now if you were talking about becoming a snowbird and flying down to florida to spend your winters then i'd probably say that's a fine idea. it's also important to take into consideration where your support system resides. when your arthritis symptoms become so severe you need help with daily or periodic tasks you need to be living where your family and friends are close enough to help you. if that's in new england then that's probably not a bad place for you to stay. i hope this helps! i've lived in va all my life and have osteo lupus and fibro. while it is warmer here in the winter than ct we do get some winters that are fairly cold - it does vary considerably and it varies a lot depending on where you live in va. another thing to weigh in is the heat and humidity - most of va especially the central and eastern half - is quite humid and is very hot in the summer. it's not unusual for it to start going into the 's in late april and stay in that range until well into october. this summer we had long stretches of days in the high 's - low 's with humidity in the -% range - and the combination of heat and humidity is particularly brutal especially if your arthritis causes compression of your c-spine nerves and you have a problem with sweating and body temp regulation because of it and/or if you are prone to migraines and sinus issues. the hot humid weather makes me far more miserable than the coldest days ever do and the older i get the less i seem able to tolerate it. so that's something to bear in mind when you consider moving here.

decreased physical activity which may be the result of cancer or of treatment can lead to tiredness and lack of energy. scientists have found that even healthy athletes forced to spend extended periods in bed or sitting in chairs develop feelings of anxiety depression weakness fatigue and nausea. regular moderate exercise can decrease these feelings help you stay active and increase your energy. even during cancer therapy it is often possible to continue exercising. in fact research has shown that cancer patients who perform a moderate exercise routine have a better quality of life and better outcomes. here are some exercise guidelines to keep in mind if you have cancer: check with your doctor before beginning an exercise program. a good exercise program starts slowly allowing your body time to adjust. keep a regular exercise schedule. exercising at least three times a week is optimal. the right kind of exercise never makes you feel sore stiff or exhausted. if you experience soreness stiffness exhaustion or feel out of breath as a result of your exercise you are overdoing it. most exercises are safe as long as you exercise with caution and don't overdo it. the safest and most productive activities are swimming brisk walking indoor stationary cycling and low-impact aerobics (taught by a certified instructor). these activities carry little risk of injury and benefit your entire body.,how does exercise impact energy level when you have cancer?,"['cancer', 'exercise']",wmd

find out whether you need malaria prevention. before you travel talk with your prescriber about your travel plans to determine whether you need to take medicine to prevent malaria. even in countries where malaria is present there may be areas of the country that are free of malaria. in general malaria is more common in rural (country) areas than in big cities and it is more common during rainy seasons when mosquitoes are most common. you can get information about the areas of the world where malaria occurs from the cdc and from local authorities in the countries you visit. if possible plan your travel to reduce the risk of malaria. take medicine to prevent malaria infection. without malaria prevention medicine you have a higher risk of getting malaria. malaria starts with flu-like symptoms such as chills fever muscle pains and headaches. however malaria can make you very sick or cause death if you don't seek medical help immediately. these symptoms may disappear for a while and you may think you are well. but the symptoms return later and then it may be too late for successful treatment. malaria can cause confusion coma and seizures. it can cause kidney failure breathing problems and severe damage to red blood cells. however malaria can be easily diagnosed with a blood test and if caught in time can be effectively treated. if you get flu-like symptoms (chills fever muscle pains or headaches) after you return from a malaria area get medical help right away and tell your health care provider that you may have been exposed to malaria. people who have lived for many years in areas with malaria may have some immunity to malaria (they do not get it as easily) and may not take malaria prevention medicine. this does not mean that you don't need to take malaria prevention medicine. protect against mosquito bites. medicines do not always completely prevent your catching malaria from mosquito bites. so protect yourself very well against mosquitoes. cover your skin with long sleeves and long pants and use mosquito repellent and bednets while in malaria areas. if you are out in the bush you may want to pre-wash your clothes with permethrin. this is a mosquito repellent that may be effective for weeks after use. ask your prescriber for other ways to protect yourself.,what should i know about preventing malaria?,['malaria'],wmd

your doctor will probably prescribe several medicines after you have had a transient ischemic attack (tia). medicines to prevent blood clots are typically used because blood clots can cause tias and strokes. the types of medicines that prevent clotting are: antiplatelet medicines. anticoagulant medicines. cholesterol -lowering and blood pressure -lowering medicines are also used to prevent tias and strokes. antiplatelet medicines antiplatelets (such as aspirin aspirin with extended-release dipyridamole or clopidogrel ) keep platelets in the blood from sticking together. aspirin is most often used to prevent tias and strokes. many studies have shown that aspirin helps prevent strokes and reduces the risk of another tia in people who have had their first tia. other antiplatelet medicines (such as clopidogrel) may be used for people who cannot take aspirin or for whom aspirin has not been effective. aggrenox a medicine that combines aspirin with dipyridamole is a safe and effective alternative to aspirin to prevent tia and stroke for some people.  anticoagulants anticoagulants prevent the production of certain proteins that are needed for blood to clot. if you have atrial fibrillation you will probably take an anticoagulant (such as warfarin ). anticoagulants are more effective than antiplatelets in preventing strokes in people with atrial fibrillation.  both anticoagulants and antiplatelets increase the risk of bleeding. warfarin (such as coumadin ) has the highest risk of bleeding problems but the risk is lower when the dosage is closely monitored. if you take warfarin don't suddenly change your intake of foods that are rich in vitamin k. vitamin k can interfere with the action of anticoagulants making it more likely that your blood will clot. for more information see: anticoagulants: vitamin k and your diet. cholesterol-lowering medicines experts recommend that most people who have had a tia take statins which lower cholesterol. many studies show that statins significantly reduce the risk of stroke in people who have had a tia. statins even protect against stroke in people who do not have heart disease or high cholesterol.  for more information on these medicines see the topic high cholesterol. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,what medications and treatments are available to treat transient ischemic attack tia?,"['transient ischemia attack', 'transient ischemic attack', 'drug']",wmd

divorce isn't just the end of an official contract; it is a legal surgery that separates two people whose lives have been joined. particularly after long marriages it is painful and traumatic and people need time to heal afterward. moving on in a healthy way — healing from the pain of divorce — requires that you feel the pain. otherwise you are just covering a wound that is likely to fester under the surface demanding attention at some later time. so it is important to allow yourself to feel the hurt anger sadness or whatever other emotional distress that your divorce inflicts upon you. then you can actively take steps forward toward a happier future. at some point you will likely want to date again. hopefully at this point you will have a life filled with many things and people that you enjoy. also if you know what you are looking for in a person (i. e. respectful partner someone to go hiking with) and relationship (i. e. just fun long term commitment) then you are more likely to find it; and feel fulfilled by it. knowing what you want is also very important when you have children. consider your child's age and personality as you decide how to proceed. consider how much you want him or her exposed to your dating life. you will probably want to shelter them a bit from your exploration as each new date might unrealistically be seen as a possible threat (i. e. taking your attention dashing hopes of reconciliation with your ex-spouse) or savior (i. e. joining the family to once again make it complete). where can you meet people? how can you go about this? while it's not easy it's not impossible either. your attitude is critical. being happy hopeful and open to meeting someone can help you. because dating can be a bumpy road a positive attitude can also help you to bounce along without feeling too bruised. here are some concrete suggestions for finding a partner: ) let people know that you are interested in dating; you might be surprised who can set you up with someone and who that someone might be (hopefully the partner of your dreams though you must also be prepared for the date of your nightmares). ) join activities or clubs that interest you; then you will be happy with what you are doing whether or not you meet a special someone. ) find out about singles activities and try some out. ) try online dating services. there are many of them; just a few popular ones are as match. com eharmony. com perfectmatch. com and lavalife. com,how can i move on with my life after a divorce? what about dating?,['movement'],wmd

it sounds like you have your work cut out for you! but the good news is that there are many good-tasting healthy foods that will fit the bill. you should start with some good basic gluten free recipes-like the ones found in our gluten-free recipes directory. look them over and pick the ones that do not contain meat. and start cooking! there are many types of vegetarian diets—ones that include eggs and dairy –or vegan options that do not include any animal products at all. if you choose ovo-lacto (eggs and dairy) vegetarianism just be sure to use only low-fat dairy in your cooking. eggs can be part of a healthy low fat diet—just dont go overboard. it is the yolk that has the cholesterol. so switch to the egg whites whenever you can. and you can use olive oil as a healthier alternative to the animal fats. if you are changing your diet because of health issues such as heart disease diabetes celiac disease or high cholesterol talk to a dietitian. they are a wealth of information. many insurance companies will even help cover the visit. detailed information about a gluten-free diet is also available at the celiac disease foundation website <link> also make sure you talk to your doctor before starting any new diet. there are several recipes that can be found on the webmd website. i have included links to gluten free recipes and vegetarian recipes. when looking at the ingredients of a recipe feel free to alter to fit within your diet regimen. i have also included a link about the tlc diet (therapeutic lifestyle changes) to help you choose foods that are lower in cholesterol.,help! . i am having difficulty locating recipes and ideas for my type of diet; i need a gluten free low cholesterol vegetarian diet. i love to cook and experiement so fear of trying new things is not an issue.,"['cholesterol', 'fear', 'diet', 'cooking', 'recipe']",wmd

many pediatricians still recommend waiting until your baby is a bit older --  or  months -- before offering allergenic foods such as milk eggs peanuts tree nuts (such as walnuts or almonds) fish shellfish soy and wheat. even if theres no added risk of causing an allergy they note that an allergic reaction may be easier to manage in an older baby. and some pediatricians concerned about the particular severity of allergic reactions to peanuts and shellfish still suggest staying away from them until your child is up to  years old. whole cow's milk should not be given to babies younger than  year old because the proteins in whole milk can irritate the stomach. yogurt and soft cheeses are fine however because the proteins in these dairy products are broken down and less likely to cause tummy trouble. you should also still wait until at least  – some experts say  -- to introduce honey which can cause a potentially serious disease called infant botulism.,how can i protect my baby against food allergies?,"['food allergy', 'baby']",wmd

cord blood is the blood thats left in the umbilical cord and placenta after birth. it can be rich in stem cells — cells that have the potential to develop into many different body tissues. in an emerging field of research and therapeutics cord blood has been used successfully to treat a number of diseases including cancer diabetes metabolic disorders and rare genetic syndromes. non-profit and government agencies are organizing public banks similar to blood banks for families to donate the cord blood at no cost so that everyone in need can find cord blood that matches. competing with these public banks are private companies trying to convince parents to pay thousands of dollars to bank the cord blood only for themselves. their web sites often contain misinformation half-truths and marketing pressure thats designed not to help your familys health but to get the money out of your familys wallet. what you wont hear from the private banks: it is very unlikely that your privately banked cord blood will ever be used by anyone. even if your baby ends up needing a cord blood transplant hell may well need someone elses cord blood — not his own. even if by some remarkable chance your baby needs his own cord blood many of the collected samples are not suitable for use. no tests will be done to determine if the cord blood collected is usable until the blood is retrieved. you may have paid thousands up front plus a substantial year fee to store well nothing at all.,should i donate my babys cord blood?,['baby'],wmd

this is an interesting question and i'm glad you asked it. in order to develop an allergy to a substance you have to be exposed to it. in other words it's extremely rare to experience an allergic reaction to something on first exposure. (it's not impossible but it's fairly rare. ) one good example is penicillin. millions of people took penicillin as children and suffered no ill effects. many of those people today have penicillin allergies. that early exposure caused their bodies to mount an extreme immune reaction to penicillin later on. that could be what happened to you too. if a physician confirmed your allergy you need to take it to heart. allergies not only can come on later in life they can get worse over time. so that diarrhea from eating eggs today could turn into anaphylaxis eventually. you also should be aware that people with a documented egg allergy may be discouraged from getting flu shots. i'd suggest you talk with your health care provider to see if this restriction applies to you. sorry you're going through this. it's difficult to give up a well-loved food.,i always ate eggs and now i have a diagnosed allergy. how does this happen? . i am  and about  years ago i began getting very sick after eating eggs. severe cramps and very bad diarrea after only  minutes or so. i just had a blood test and it shows i do have an allergy to eggs. how can this happen after a lifetime of enjoying eggs. i really miss soft boiled eggs. is there a trigger for this type of allergy? i don't understand how this can happen. any ideas? . thank you,"['allergy', 'blood test', 'diarrhea', 'cramps']",wmd

head lice are really uncomfortable to see. i think most parents go through this at some point with their kids going to school and the only way to find it is to really look very closely at your child's scalp. so in school it's very hard for these children not to have contact with each other share brushes hats scarves and that's really how it's spread. so as much as possible if you can instruct your kid not to share these products with their friends that would be a great start and a great way to prevent it. but beyond that you just have to examine your child's scalp very closely. what you will typically find rather than the active lice is nits. what nits look like they really look like flakes of dandruff except that when you try to remove it it won't come off the hair because what the lice do the nits are the eggs from the lice that will hatch within a week or so so what the lice do is they create this little capsule and they glue it to the hair and that's how it sticks. so it's very hard to take it off. the problem is i have parents come in and they say well but my child would shampoo their scalp everyday. and that makes it worse because when the hair is that clean the glue sticks better. so you are almost better off having a greasy scalp because it's harder for that nit to stick to the scalp. so it's not a matter of cleanliness at all. but once those nits are attached to the scalp you really have to get a prescription treatment to help get rid of it. there is a prescription called ovide that you put on to the scalp leave it on for a few hours and then shampoo it out and repeat it in a week to get rid of any nits that might have hatched by then.,how can i tell if my child has head lice and what do they look like?,['head lice'],wmd

it's starting to come back in vogue to utilize a slow cooker or crock pot. in general i am someone who likes to get great healthy food on the table fast. i dont always do well with things that are slow. however the amount of time it takes to prepare ingredients for the slow cooker is fast and i like that you dont have to think about it again until its time to eat. here are some tips on ways to revitalize flavor reverse bad past crock-pot experiences and have a healthy savory meal that is not an overcooked pile of mush. the first and most important tip to having a delicious crock pot meal is to choose the right type of ingredients. this is where you should utilize ingredients that take longer to cook like traditionally tough cuts of meat. these include brisket pork butt or an entire chicken. (by the way these are traditionally less expensive meats. so if you are trying to budget for meals this is a great way to help with that — or if you are trying to budget for organic ingredients this is where you can upgrade to organic or natural cuts of meat. ). when cooked for so many hours these tougher meats taste great and fall off the bone easily. and you get the added benefit of pulling nutrients from the bone. if youve had a bad experience with a crock pot most likely youve participated in the biggest mistake: do not use canned vegetables in a slow cooker. period. ever. using canned vegetables in a crock pot recipe will simply turn your meal into a vegetable smoothie. canned vegetables are already overcooked when they are put in the can. cooking them for another - hours will disintegrate them. potatoes carrot onions and other firm veggies do well in a slow cooker. using canned tomatoes is fine — mostly because you will probably be using them in a sauce so they hold up well. absolute no-nos: canned green beans canned corn and canned peas. actually let me go ahead and advise you to never use these canned vegetables if you can help it. under-seasoning is another mistake i see people make all the time. since the food is cooking there for so long — the equivalent of a long slow boil — there needs to be a few levels of flavors. there are a couple ways to do this. if you are making a meat or bean dish i suggest sautéing savories like onions shallots or garlic in extra virgin olive oil first before you put in the crock pot. the flavors seep into the oil better if you take this extra step. also add fresh-cut herbs at the very end or a squeeze of lemon or lime to brighten up the dish and give fresh flavor quickly. add ingredients that are high in flavor. for example fire-roasted tomatoes or fire-roasted chilies. another tip is that adding a half piece of bacon cut into small pieces will add tons of flavor without all the fat. a half piece of bacon has about .  grams of fat depending on the size. not bad for adding another dimension of smoky delicious flavor. can you tell im a fan of bacon? here are some easy crock pot tips for the ultimate chicken soup. take an entire chicken quartered and bone in cover with enough water to cover the chicken. for every four cups of water throw in a - inch piece of ginger root and about  whole garlic cloves. then add carrots celery and onions and cook for eight hours on the low setting or four hours on high. at the end add fresh cut parsley and a squeeze of fresh lemon. the slow cooker pulls out the flavor in this traditional soup in ways that you wouldnt experience if it was cooked quickly. and not only do you get the nutrition in the bones but the chicken falling off the bone. you can also use the slow cooker for a healthy delicious breakfast. throw in steel cut oats and water and about a teaspoon of cinnamon and slow cook over night. you can also add dried fruits like apples or apricots — these will rehydrate and add great nutrition and flavor. yes its slow but worth the wait. enjoy the delicious benefits of your crock pot while winter is upon us. i want to see crock pot what it looks like most foods that are cooked in hard bottom in covered pot can be cooked fast with high heat according the type of food,how can my crock pot help me make fast healthy food?,['food'],wmd

we hear in the news and in commercials that plant sterols are good for us and lower cholesterol levels. we are even fortifying certain foods and some baby aspirin with these phytosterols. yet these phytosterols may be more atherogenic (have the ability to initiate or accelerate atherogenesis — formation of fat deposits on the inner lining of blood vessels) than cholesterol in certain groups of people. stanols on the other hand are good for everyone and do lower cholesterol levels. lets start with some definitions: * cholesterol is a sterol. a sterol is a steroid with an alcohol group attached to it. * stanols are saturated or reduced sterols that are similar to cholesterol but have a methyl or an ethyl group attached to them. this difference minimizes stanol absorption in the intestines. * cholestanol is a stanol. cholesterol can be broken down by the liver into cholestanol and thus is a by-product of cholesterol metabolism. if sterols or stanols are esterified (combined with fatty acids) then they can be incorporated into margarine. we consume many sterols from plant sources (sitosterol campesterol and stigmasterol) shellfish (desmosterol and fucosterol) and animal sources (cholesterol). all of these sterols with the exception of cholesterol are collectively referred to as noncholesterol sterols. collectively these sterols can be called phytosterols. sitosterol represents about % of all noncholesterol sterols in the diet and is the most well known noncholesterol sterol in the diet. when fats (triglycerides) enter the intestine in our food they are broken down into their basic building blocks. the main breakdown products are called fatty acids. these fatty acids and sterols from dietary sources are packaged into what is called a micelle. these micelles ferry these fatty acids and sterols to the intestinal lining (epithelium). they are then absorbed by passive diffusion into the intestinal cells. passive diffusion is a biological principle that substances flow through a semi-permeable tissue from an area of higher concentration to an area of lesser concentration. there is no pump required to get them out of the intestine and ultimately into the bloodstream. most humans absorb about % of sterols in the intestines. however there are some people who are what is termed hyperabsorbers (they absorb -%) and some are hypoabsorbers (they absorb less than %). noncholesterol sterols are not esterified as humans do not have the enzymes necessary for that. when these unesterified sterols get into an arterial wall they are more atherogenic than cholesterol (an esterified sterol). this means they have a greater artery clogging potential than does cholesterol. if one lacks these transporters (homozygote) all sterols are absorbed and none are pumped back out: this is a very rare homozygous condition leading to the disease called sitosterolemia or phytosterolemia. it is associated with severe atherosclerosis as noncholesterol sterols (which cannot be esterified) are more atherogenic than cholesterol. heterozygotes people who have some transporter function eliminate some but not all of these phytosterols. stanols do not require these transporters to get back into these intestines. this is the reason that they are safe and effective to reduce cholesterol. stanols are commercially available in the supermarket in a product called benecol. in summary noncholesterol sterols serve no physiologic function in man. all sterols are atherogenic if they accumulate in the arterial wall. stanols are saturated sterols. they are not absorbed and can be used therapeutically to reduce cholesterol absorption from the intestine.,what is the critical difference between a sterol and a stanol?,[],wmd
"this is an issue that only your urologist can (or should answer). anytime that you see blood in the toilet it can only be from about two sources: the urine or the bowels. since you recently had surgery for kidney stones you are likely to form more so another ct scan of the kidney may be in your future especially since you are in pain. even tiny kidneys stones can cause severe pain if they are lodge in the ureter so it would be best not to ignore these symptoms and consult your urologist. if you cannot see your urologist quickly then an emergency room visit is appropriate. they will most likely order an immediate ct scan of the kidney with your history and symptoms. i have ""been there and done that"" (stent and all) so my heart goes out to you. it feels as if it is trying to pass my stone in the last  "" in my ureter. when attempting to squeeze out the last amount of urine it hurt a bit and some blood came out. is this normal during the passing process?",do i still have kidney stones? . i had surgery  months ago to remove  stones and a stent. im still in a lot of pain in the same area as before. my urine seems to be clear although after i urinate i find blood on the toliet tissue but not in the urine. i have also noticed some tissue in my urine. im in alot of pain an need answers please.,"['urination', 'kidney stone', 'surgery', 'pain', 'stent']",wmd

"i can see why it might sound logical that calcium supplementation could help broken bones heal faster. after all bones are made of calcium right? so feeding them calcium should speed up healing. unfortunately that's not how it works. unless you have a pre-existing calcium deficiency (not likely in an otherwise healthy -year-old boy) taking calcium will not help your bones heal. the process of bone healing is called ""remodeling.

sometimes you can burn more calories when you are asleep than when you are just lying in bed. and it all has to do with our stages of sleep specifically rem sleep. during rem sleep your brain is more active than any other stage. in fact in some cases it is more active than when you are awake. this activity requires fuel for thought called glucose – the basic building block of most foods. in order to sleep better and lose weight: lose the snooze and set your alarm to tell you when to go to bed. use your alarm to help you know when to go bed to get the right amount of quality sleep. dont use the snooze button to potentially interrupt those final minutes of rem sleep! take a quick nap if you are feeling drowsy in the middle of the day. drink one glass of water for every alcoholic beverage you drink and stop all alcohol  hours before your bed time alarm goes off. alcohol can help you fall asleep but will keep you out of the deep stages of sleep and rem sleep that you need to avoid sleep deprivation stop exercise four hours before bed. work out earlier in the evening and consider yoga deep breathing or stretching before bed. have your breakfast outside in the morning and get plenty of sunlight to help re-set your internal biological clock. sleep loss affects weight loss — from your ability to burn calories to the food choices you make. start with a commitment to sleeping better and you may find yourself a few pounds lighter without changing anything else.,do i burn calories while im sleeping?,[],wmd

if you are sensitized to the rh factor if your blood is rh-negative and you have been sensitized to rh-positive blood you now have antibodies to rh-positive blood. the antibodies kill rh-positive red blood cells. if you become pregnant with an rh-positive baby ( fetus ) the antibodies can destroy your fetus's red blood cells. this can cause anemia. if you are already rh-sensitized and are pregnant your treatment will focus on preventing or minimizing fetal harm and on avoiding early (preterm) delivery. treatment options depend on how well or poorly the fetus is doing. if testing shows that your fetus is rh-positive but is only mildly affected by your rh factor antibodies you will be closely monitored until your pregnancy reaches term. your fetus will be delivered early only if his or her condition worsens. if testing shows that your fetus is moderately affected by your rh antibodies your fetus's condition will be closely monitored until his or her lungs are mature enough for a preterm delivery. a cesarean section may be used to deliver the baby quickly or to avoid the difficulty of inducing labor before term. a moderately affected newborn sometimes requires a blood transfusion immediately after birth. if testing shows that your fetus is severely affected by your rh factor antibodies a blood transfusion may be given before birth ( intrauterine fetal blood transfusion ). this can be done through the fetus's abdomen or directly into the fetus's umbilical cord. a preterm delivery is likely to be needed. multiple blood transfusions are sometimes needed to keep a fetus healthy until the fetal lungs mature enough to function after birth. often a cesarean section is done to deliver the baby quickly. a blood transfusion is sometimes needed immediately after birth. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,how is rh sensitization during pregnancy treated?,['pregnancy'],wmd

when you're bitten by a malaria -infected mosquito the parasites that cause malaria are injected into your blood and invade your liver cells. the parasite reproduces in the liver cells which then burst open allowing thousands of new parasites to enter the bloodstream and infect red blood cells. the parasites reproduce again in the blood cells kill the blood cells and then move to other uninfected blood cells. the time from the initial malaria infection until symptoms appear (incubation period) generally ranges from:   to  days for plasmodium (p. ) falciparum.  to  days for p. vivax and p. ovale.  to  days for p. malariae.  to  days for p. knowlesi. symptoms can appear in  days. occasionally the time between exposure and signs of illness may be as long as  to  months with p. vivax and p. ovale because these parasites can survive in the human liver for a long time. the incubation period may be longer if you are taking medicine to prevent infection (chemoprophylaxis) or have developed partial immunity due to previous infections. malaria can begin with flu -like symptoms. in the early stages infection from p. falciparum is similar to infection from p. vivax p. malariae and p. ovale. you may have no symptoms or symptoms that are less severe if you are immune or partially immune to malaria. common malaria symptoms include: fever. chills and a rapidly rising temperature. headaches nausea and extreme sweating. symptoms may appear in cycles. the time between episodes of fever and other symptoms varies with the specific parasite you are infected with. episodes of symptoms may occur: every  hours if you are infected with p. vivax or p. ovale. every  hours if you are infected with p. malariae. p. falciparum does not usually have a regular cyclic fever. after the early stages life-threatening complications develop rapidly with p. falciparum and p. knowlesi and if untreated may result in irreversible complications or death.  if untreated you may recover in a week to a month (or longer) after being infected with p. vivax p. malariae or p. ovale. malaria can be a very serious disease for a pregnant woman and her unborn baby ( fetus ) and for young children. medication choices are limited for a pregnant woman or a child. infection with p. falciparum can lead to death for a pregnant woman and her fetus. for these reasons a pregnant woman should not travel to an area where she could get p. falciparum malaria. visit the cdc web site (www. cdc. gov/malaria/travel/index. htm) to find out whether malaria is a problem in the country where you will be traveling. malaria recurrences malaria caused by p. falciparum may come back (recur) at irregular intervals for up to  years if treatment is not complete. malaria caused by p. vivax and p. ovale may recur at irregular intervals for up to  to  years but medication treatment can prevent relapses. p. malariae can remain in the blood of an infected person for more than  years usually without causing any symptoms. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,what happens to someone when they get malaria?,['malaria'],wmd

hopefully you have seen a doctor about this strain if it seems serious it may be a torn muscle and may cause other problems. mistreating an abdominal strain (either by icing or stretching wrong) could be fatal. speak to a doctor before treating a sprain. if it is mild or you have already spoken to a doctor : rest: rest is recommended for the early recovery phase lasting  to  days depending on the severity of the injury. immobilization is not usually necessary and can be potentially harmful. immobilization in a splint or cast should be carefully supervised by your doctor as this can lead to stiffness of the muscle. ice: ice application helps reduce swelling bleeding and pain. ice application should begin as soon as possible after sustaining a muscle pull. ice applications can be done frequently but should not be done for more than  minutes at a time. anti-inflammatory medications: anti-inflammatory medications can help reduce swelling and alleviate painful symptoms. these medications do have potential side effects and you should check with your doctor prior to starting anti-inflammatory medications. gentle stretching: stretching and strengthening are useful in treatment and prevention of muscle strain injuries. muscles that are stronger and more flexible are less likely to be injured. strengthening: after injuring the muscle it is important to regain strength before returning to athletic activities. both the injury itself and the rest period following the injury can reduce the strength of the muscle. stronger muscles are less likely to sustain a re-injury. heat applications: laboratory studies have shown that temperature can influence the stiffness of a muscle. by keeping the body and muscles warm the muscle is less likely to sustain a strain type of injury. avoid muscle fatigue: muscles help absorb energy and restoring the strength of the muscle will help prevent re-injury. muscles that are fatigued are more likely to be injured. athletes should use caution especially as they become fatigued as the muscle becomes more susceptible to strain injuries. warm-up properly: warming up prior to athletic competition or sports will help loosen the muscle and prevent injuries. jumping into a sport with stiff muscles can lead to a higher chance of straining the muscle.,what do you do for a lower abdominal muscle strain? . my son injured himself during track season. he has been hurt for the last two months. we went to the doctor and it is not a hernia. he has been checked for that. he still cannot run and is some pain. it is a bothersome pain that flares up when he is active. what should we do for this?,"['hernia', 'injury', 'muscle', 'pain', 'running']",wmd

your daughter is obese and needs a full assessment. her major weight gain occurred roughly at the time her endocrine system kicked in with her menstrual cycle. i would ask her physician to look into two conditions: cushing's disease and polycystic ovarian syndrome. the evaluations are straightforward and both are amenable to effective therapies. clearly her thyroid function needs to be assessed as well. if the family history is strong for obesity it is common for girls to express the obesity gene at time of pubescence. teens can sneak eat with the best of them so what you see her eat may not at all reflect what she's actually consuming. if the home environment includes lots of junk food sitting around and people who are themselves not practicing healthy nutrition and exercise habits then she'll emulate those habits. finally research shows that in teen girls physical activity plummets by the age of  or so. they literally stop moving. but they don't stop eating. thus the problem. please get the medical assessment done completely and as soon as possible.,my active -year-old daughter has gained a lot of weight this year. she is  foot  and weighs . what should we do?,"['foot', 'weight']",wmd

here are some basic steps that you can take to protect yourself from contracting stds: consider that not having sex is the only sure way to prevent stds. use a latex condom every time you have sex particularly if you have more than one sex partner. (if you use a lubricant make sure it is water-based. ) limit your number of sexual partners. the more partners you have the more likely you are to catch a std. practice monogamy. this means having sex with only one person. that person must also have sex with only you to reduce your risk. choose your sex partners with care. don't have sex with someone whom you suspect may have a std or who has many sexual partners. get checked for stds. don't risk giving the infection to someone else or your baby. just because you've been screened for stds early on in your pregnancy does not mean that you can't contract one later during your pregnancy. if you engage in unprotected sex with more than one partner since your last std screen you need another set of screening tests. also you should be concerned if your partner may be having unprotected sex with other people. don't use alcohol or drugs before you have sex. you may be less likely to practice safe sex if you are drunk or high. plus alcohol and drugs can harm your developing baby. know the signs and symptoms of stds. look for them in yourself and your sex partners. learn about stds. the more you know about stds the better you can protect yourself.,how can i protect myself against sexually transmitted diseases (stds) during pregnancy?,"['sexually transmitted disease', 'pregnancy']",wmd

most helpful answer i have never heard that cholesterol causes stomach pains. just because a cause was not readily apparent does not mean one should blame this type of pain on cholesterol. the fact that he is still in pain (after eating) and going through pepto bismol is proof that he needs to have a higher level evaluation. seeing a pediatric gastroenterologist would be the way to go if his pediatrician or primary care provider is not willing to order further diagnostic tests. there are so many things that could be causing this discomfort for gastritis (inflammation of the stomach) reflux gallbladder disease (especially if your son is overweight) hiatal hernia etc. appendicitis would likely cause pain in his right lower quadrant (down near the right iliac/hip area) and would not really present symptoms like you are describing. if he is under stress at home or school this could be making things worse. get a referral to a gastroenterologist so that he can be properly diagnosed and treated. stomach pains in an  year old could be many things- gastritis (when the stomach lining is irritated) reflux (like heartburn in adults) constipation or something more serious. sometimes anxiety or stress can make kids have abdominal pain. in any case you should be seen by your doctor or a specialist. if its been going on for a while your son needs to be evaluated. i have not heard of cholesterol issues causing stomach pains. talk to your doctor or subspecialist as soon as you can.,my  yr old son has constent stomach aches what could be causing this. everytime my son eats something with in a few minutes his stomach starts hurting. i asked him what it feels like and he sayes he feels nauseated like he is going to throw up. i took him to the doctor and she said it was his cholesterol so i changed his diet but the pains still continuing. i'm worried it might be his gallbladder or his appendix he is going through pepto bismol like crazy and i am very worried that something is more seriously wrong with him,"['appendix', 'gallbladder', 'stomach', 'cholesterol', 'diet']",wmd
in case you didn't know it ringworm isn't caused by a worm at all. ringworm is actually a skin fungus just like athlete's foot or jock itch. you can get ringworm in a variety of ways from sharing a towel with someone who's infected to touching damp surfaces that carry the fungus. the fungus that causes ringworm thrives in warm damp environments which is why it's frequently acquired in places like public pool common areas. to your question: you could catch ringworm from your friend even if you didn't touch the lesion. the reason is because the fungus could be infecting other areas of your friend's skin but not showing the characteristic ring mark yet. if you have thoroughly washed and dried the skin areas that came in contact with your friend you're probably not going to get ringworm. however be careful not to share any sports gear or towels with your friend and be sure to wear flip-flops or other foot protection if you all are bathing in a common shower area or something like that. by the way ringworm will not clear up on its own. it needs to be treated with an anti-fungal preparation. your friend can try using an over-the-counter cream for athlete's foot (the generic name is miconazole) but if that doesn't help or if the ringworm starts spreading your friend should seek medical attention. in rare instances ringworm is best treated with a prescription medication. hope this helps! my daughter caught it from her friend  yrs ago and it was from putting her slippers on. i never caught it tho when i rubbed the ointment on her back where it was. i immediately washed my hands tho too. i guess different people affected differently by things.,a friend contracted ringworm and i touched his skin but not the infected area. what are the chances of contracting it? . a friend of mine from a youth group i go to recently contracted ringworm on his arm. he was with the group tonight and had the area covered with a huge bandage yet he would peel the bandage off just enough for people to see the ring and then immediately put it back on. i never touched the infected area but i did come into skin-to-skin contact with him during a couple games and activities. i washed my hands face and other possible areas of contact with soap but will i get ringworm?,"['ringworm', 'arm', 'hand', 'skin', 'vision']",wmd

how athlete's foot (tinea pedis) develops and how well it responds to treatment depends on the type of athlete's foot you have. toe web infection (interdigital) toe web infections (interdigital) often begin with skin that seems moist and pale white. you may notice itching burning and a slight odor. as the infection gets worse the skin between the toes becomes scaly peels and cracks. if the fungal infection becomes severe a bacterial infection also may develop. this can cause further skin breakdown. the bacterial infection may also infect the lower leg ( cellulitis of the lower leg). toe web infections often result in a sudden vesicular (blister) infection. toe web infections respond well to treatment. moccasin-type infection moccasin-type infections may begin with minor irritation dryness itching burning or scaly skin and progress to thickened cracked skin on the sole or heel. in severe cases the toenails become infected and can thicken crumble and even fall out. if you do not take preventive measures this infection often returns. you may also develop an infection on the palm of the hand (symptoms commonly affect one hand and both feet). moccasin-type infections may be long-lasting (chronic) and are very difficult to treat. vesicular infection vesicular infections ( blisters ) usually begin with a sudden outbreak of blisters that become red and inflamed. blisters occasionally erupt again after the initial infection. a bacterial infection may also be present. a vesicular infection often develops from a long-lasting toe web infection. blisters may also appear on palms the side of the fingers and other areas (dermatophytid or id reaction). vesicular infections usually respond well to treatment. complications if untreated skin blisters and cracks caused by athlete's foot can lead to severe bacterial infections. in some types of athlete's foot the toenails may be infected. for more information see the topic fungal nail infections. all types of athlete's foot can be treated but symptoms often return after treatment. athlete's foot is most likely to return if: you don't take preventive measures and are again exposed to fungi that cause athlete's foot. you don't use antifungal medicine for the prescribed length of time and the fungi are not completely killed. the fungi are not completely killed even after the full course of medicine. severe infections that appear suddenly and keep returning can lead to long-lasting infection. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,what happens to someone when they get athletes foot?,"[""athlete's foot""]",wmd

in general you dont need to eat before exercise unless you tend to run low on energy during your workouts or its been more than a couple hours since your last full meal. the best time to eat is about  minutes before you begin to exercise and the best snack is one that combines carbohydrates and protein (with an emphasis on the carbs). and you dont need a lot of food. protein isnt a fuel for exercise so you dont want to overdo it. for carbs aim for the equivalent of a half bagel or a large banana; for protein consider a couple tablespoons of peanut butter or a small cup of yogurt. to get both if fresh food isnt an option look for energy bars with  to  grams of carbohydrates and about  grams of protein. steer clear of caffeine and warm fluids which tend to speed food through your intestine as well as dairy and high-fat or high-fiber foods all of which can upset your stomach slow down the absorption of carbs and leave you feeling sluggish. you should also stay well hydrated and avoid super high-calorie snacks because you might end up consuming more calories than you burn off.,whats the best snack to eat before exercise and how long before my workout should i eat it?,"['snack', 'exercise', 'workout']",wmd
"there may be a number of reasons why a woman gets depressed. hormone changes or a stressful life event such as a death in the family can cause chemical changes in the brain that lead to depression. depression is also an illness that runs in some families. other times it's not clear what causes depression. during pregnancy during pregnancy these factors may increase a woman's chance of depression: history of depression or substance abuse family history of mental illness little support from family and friends anxiety about the fetus problems with previous pregnancy or birth marital or financial problems young age (of mother) after pregnancy depression after pregnancy is called postpartum depression or peripartum depression. after pregnancy hormonal changes in a woman's body may trigger symptoms of depression. during pregnancy the amount of two female hormones estrogen and progesterone in a woman's body increases greatly. in the first  hours after childbirth the amount of these hormones rapidly drops back down to their normal non-pregnant levels. researchers think the fast change in hormone levels may lead to depression just as smaller changes in hormones can affect a woman's moods before she gets her menstrual period. occasionally levels of thyroid hormones may also drop after giving birth. the thyroid is a small gland in the neck that helps to regulate your metabolism (how your body uses and stores energy from food). low thyroid levels can cause symptoms of depression including depressed mood decreased interest in things irritability fatigue difficulty concentrating sleep problems and weight gain. a simple blood test can tell if this condition is causing a woman's depression. if so thyroid medicine can be prescribed by a doctor. other factors that may contribute to postpartum depression include: feeling tired after delivery broken sleep patterns and not enough rest often keeps a new mother from regaining her full strength for weeks. feeling overwhelmed with a new or another baby to take care of and doubting your ability to be a good mother. feeling stress from changes in work and home routines. sometimes women think they have to be ""super mom"" or perfect which is not realistic and can add stress. having feelings of loss -- loss of identity of who you are or were before having the baby loss of control loss of your pre-pregnancy figure and feeling less attractive. having less free time and less control over time. having to stay home indoors for longer periods of time and having less time to spend with your partner and loved ones.",what causes depression in women specifically related to pregnancy and childbirth?,"['depression', 'pregnancy']",wmd

removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) should eliminate all gallstone-related symptoms except in three situations: gallstones were left in the ducts there were problems with the bile ducts in addition to gallstones and the gallstones were and are not the cause of the symptoms. the possibility of gallstones in the ducts can be pursued with mrcp endoscopic ultrasound and ercp. there is only one problem with the ducts that can cause gallstone-like symptoms and that is a rare condition called sphincter of oddi dysfunction discussed below. the common bile duct has a muscular wall. the last several centimeters of the common bile duct's muscle immediately before the duct joins the duodenum comprise the sphincter of oddi. the sphincter of oddi controls the flow of bile. since the pancreatic duct usually joins the common bile duct shortly before it enters the duodenum the sphincter also controls the flow of fluid from the pancreatic duct. when the muscle of the sphincter tightens it shuts off the flow of bile and pancreatic fluid. when it relaxes bile and pancreatic fluid flow into the duodenum for example after a meal. the sphincter may become scarred and the duct is narrowed by the scarring. (the cause of the scarring is unknown). the sphincter also may go into spasm intermittently. in either case the flow of bile and pancreatic fluid may intermittently stop abruptly mimicking the effects of a gallstone particularly causing biliary colic and pancreatitis. the diagnosis of sphincter of oddi dysfunction can be difficult to make. the best diagnostic test requires an endoscopic procedure with the same type of endoscope as ercp. instead of filling the ducts with dye however the pressure within the sphincter is measured. if the pressure is abnormally high scarring or spasm of the sphincter are likely. the treatment for sphincter of oddi dysfunction is sphincterotomy. measurement of liver and pancreatic enzymes in the blood also may be useful for diagnosing sphincter dysfunction.,can symptoms continue after gallstones are removed?,['gallstone'],wmd

prostate cancer is diagnosed from the results of a biopsy of the prostate gland. if the digital rectal exam of the prostate or the psa blood test is abnormal a prostate cancer is suspected. a biopsy of the prostate is usually then recommended. the biopsy is done from the rectum (trans-rectally) and is guided by ultrasound images of the area. a small piece of prostate tissue is withdrawn through a cutting needle. the trus-guided tru-cut biopsy is currently the standard method to diagnose prostate cancer. although initially a -core set was the standard currently most experts advocate sampling a minimum of  to  pieces of the prostate to improve the chances of detection of the cancer and also to provide a better idea regarding the extent and areas of involvement within the prostate. multiple pieces are taken by sampling the base apex and mid gland on each side of the gland. more cores may be sampled to increase the yield especially in larger glands. a pathologist a specialist physician who analyzes tissue samples under a microscope then examines the pieces under the microscope to assess the type of cancer present in the prostate and the extent of involvement of the prostate with the tumor. one also can get an idea about the areas of the prostate that are involved by the tumor by assessing which of the pieces contain the cancer and which of them do not. another very important assessment that the pathologist makes form the specimen is the grade (gleason's score) of the tumor. this indicates how different the cancer cells are from normal prostate tissue. grade gives an indication of how fast a cancer is likely to grow and has very important implications on the treatment plan and the chances of cure after treatment. a gleason score of six is supposed to indicate low-grade (less aggressive) disease while that of eight to  demonstrates high grade (more aggressive) cancer; seven is regarded as somewhere in between these two.,how is prostate cancer diagnosed and graded?,['prostate cancer'],wmd

migraine-specific medications usually are necessary for moderate-to-severe migraine headaches. the medications for moderate or severe migraine headaches are different than over-the-counter (otc) analgesics. instead of relieving pain they stop headaches by counteracting the cause of the headache dilation of the temporal arteries. in fact they cause narrowing of the arteries. examples of migraine-specific medications are the triptans and ergot preparations. triptans the triptans attach to serotonin receptors on the blood vessels and nerves thereby reducing inflammation and constricting the blood vessels. this stops the headache. the triptan with the longest history of use is sumatriptan (imitrex). sumatriptan is available in the u. s. as an injection oral tablet and nasal spray. zolmitriptan (zomig) and rizatriptan (maxalt) are newer triptans that are available as oral tablets and as tablets that melt in the mouth. naratriptan (amerge) almotriptan (axert) and frovatriptan (frovalan) are available only as oral tablets. traditionally triptans were prescribed for moderate or severe migraines after otc analgesics and other simple measures failed. newer studies suggest that triptans can be used as the first treatment for patients with migraines that are causing disability. (significant disability is defined as more than  days of at least % disability during a three-month period). triptans should be used early after the migraine begins before the onset of pain or when the pain is mild. using a triptan early in an attack increases its effectiveness reduces side effects and decreases the chance of recurrence of another headache during the following  hours. used early triptans can be expected to abort more than % of migraine headaches within two hours. ergots ergots like triptans are medications that abort migraine headaches. examples of ergots include ergotamine preparations (ergomar wigraine and cafergot) and dihydroergotamine preparations (migranal dhe-). ergots like triptans cause constriction of blood vessels but ergots tend to cause more constriction of vessels in the heart and other parts of the body than the triptans and their effects on the heart are more prolonged than the triptans. therefore they are not as safe as the triptans. the ergots also are more prone to cause nausea and vomiting than the triptans. the ergots can cause prolonged contraction of the uterus and miscarriages in pregnant women. midrin midrin is used to abort migraine and tension headaches. it is a combination of isometheptene (a blood vessel constrictor) acetaminophen (a pain reliever) and dichloralphenazone (a mild sedative). it is most effective if used early during a headache; however because of its potent blood vessel constricting effect it should not be used in patients with high blood pressure kidney disease glaucoma atherosclerosis liver disease or who are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors.,what is the treatment for moderate to severe migraine headaches?,"['migraine', 'headache']",wmd

it's a bacterial infection so it can be treated with antibiotics usually erythromycin or similar antibiotics. if antibiotics are recommended its important to take all the doses as prescribed. over-the-counter cough medicines are not recommended and don't really help. the prescription medicines that are effective for cough are strong and they're generally avoided in young children and are probably not effective for pertussis. it's commonly recommended to minimize the things that can trigger the cough. with younger kids try to keep them quiet and limit their activity. a humidifier is often used as breathing moist air can soothe the airways. infants with severe disease require hospitalization sometimes in intensive care. it can be serious enough to require intubation and ventilation -- in which a breathing tube is inserted into the throat both to protect the airways and to assist with breathing until they can recover from the infection.,how is whooping cough treated?,['whooping cough'],wmd
most experts agree it's possible to have some sort of bariatric (weight loss) surgery after having had a fundoplication. as you probably know there are many types of bariatric surgery. some of these include: gastric bypass lap band and sleeve gastrectomy among others. your best bet is to talk to a bariatric surgeon. he or she can explain all the risks involved. depending on the type of bariatric surgery you have you may be at greater risk for certain complications since you have undergone fundoplication. these complications may include injury to the stomach and leakage. again these are potential complications you should discuss with a bariatric surgeon. when thinking about bariatric surgery it's best to find a surgeon who specializes in these procedures. ask what type(s) of bariatric surgery the surgeon performs how many procedures he or she performs each year and how often his or her patients encounter serious complications after the surgery. it's also a good idea to interview several surgeons before making a choice. you can ask for referrals to speak to former patients though health care laws may make it difficult for a doctor to provide such information. but it never hurts to ask!,if you have had a fundiplication can you have gastric bypass surgery? . i can not physically vomit could this cause a problem with gastric bypass,"['surgery', 'vomit', 'gastric bypass surgery']",wmd
i completely emphasize with you. the problem of premature ejaculation is quite common and is distressing to a young man but is seldom discussed. see most of the time the problem is secondary to the anxiety attached to your expectations in the bed. it has been wrongly projected by unscientific magazine articles and porn that a man can last for  minutes or more. honestly most of the male ejaculate before  minutes. when you are anxious about not lasting long in bed you actually do not enjoy the act of intercourse and keep on thinking about prolonging the act without enjoying it. the preoccupation and anxiety about not lasting enough in fact cause hyperarousal and lead to premature ejaculation. moreover when the male start to thrust himself into the partner the moment he undress leads to early termination of coital act (the sexual union that takes place between male and female during insertion of penis into the vagina). there are also lots of young man who are suffering from premature ejaculation without any associated anxiety or apprehension. such men as well as you may benefit by taking oral medication like tablet dapoxetine or paroxetine before sexual act. but in your case i would like to suggest relaxation techniques like breathing exercises and progressive muscular relaxation. regarding your problem pertaining to non-retractable foreskin my opinion is that you must consult a surgeon. it is always better to remove foreskin if it is causing inflammation or itchiness. non-retractable foreskin is often associated with problems of genital hygiene that may subsequently lead to chronic infections. so make an appointment with a general surgeon. for further queries consult a sexologist online --> <link>,i am facing premature ejaculation. how do i overcome it?,['premature ejaculation'],ic

allergies are the result of an overactive immune system. in response to a substance like pollen or pet dander the bodys natural defenses become over-activated to fight the invader.  inflammatory reactions to allergens commonly occur in areas including the eyes nose and throat. an influx of white blood cells and local release of irritating chemicals are the bodys response during an allergic reaction. swelling in the lymph nodes in the area of the neck jaw and throat can sometimes occur. however swollen lymph glands can also be caused by viral and bacterial infections and other causes. like the other symptoms of seasonal allergies swollen lymph nodes eventually go away without causing any problems. if you have lymph nodes that are persistently swollen for several weeks see your doctor for further evaluation.,can allergies cause swollen glands?,"['allergy', 'swelling']",wmd
plant sterols are actually quite natural. they are part of the cell membranes in plants and are structurally similar to cholesterol. in the body they go to work during digestion displacing dietary cholesterol in the cells lining the small intestine (where cholesterol is normally absorbed). what can plant sterols do in the body? according to a recent scientific review a diet enriched with plant sterols can on average reduce ldl cholesterol by approximately  percent. the favorable effect on ldl appears to be at its greatest at a dose of  grams a day. natural plant sources of plant sterols: plant sterols are found in small amounts in many healthful plant foods including grains fruits nuts and vegetables: avocado  ounces ( small) =  mg phytosterols. soybeans  cup =  mg phytosterols. chickpeas / cup =  mg phytosterols. almonds  ounce =  mg phytosterols. olive oil  tablespoon =  mg phytosterols.,why are plant sterols good for me?,['plant'],wmd

"eczema is used as a general term for many types of skin inflammation (dermatitis) and allergic-type skin rashes. there are different types of eczema including allergic contact irritant and nummular eczema. several other forms have very similar symptoms. the diverse types of eczema are listed and briefly described below. atopic dermatitis is typically a more specific set of three associated conditions occurring in the same person including eczema allergies and asthma. not every component has to be present at the same time but usually these patients are prone to all of these three related conditions. types of eczema contact eczema : a localized reaction that includes redness itching and burning where the skin has come into contact with an allergen (an allergy-causing substance) or with an irritant such as an irritating acid a cleaning agent or other chemical allergic contact eczema : a red itchy weepy reaction where the skin has come into contact with a substance that the immune system recognizes as foreign such as poison ivy or certain preservatives in creams and lotions seborrheic eczema (also called seborrheic dermatitis or seborrhea): is a very common form of mild skin inflammation of unknown cause that presents as yellowish oily scaly patches of skin on the scalp face ears and occasionally other parts of the body. often this is also called dandruff in adults or ""cradle cap"" in infants. nummular eczema : coin-shaped (round) isolated patches of irritated skin -- most commonly on the arms back buttocks and lower legs -- that may be crusted scaling and extremely itchy neurodermatitis : a very particular type of dermatitis where the person frequently picks at their skin causing rashes. the underling cause may be a sensitivity or irritation which sets off a cascade of repeated itching and scratching cycles. it may be seen as scratch marks and pick marks on the skin. sometimes scaly patches of skin on the head lower legs wrists or forearms caused by a localized itch (such as an insect bite) may become intensely irritated when scratched. stasis dermatitis : a skin irritation on the lower legs generally related to circulatory problems and congestion of the leg veins. it may have a darker pigmentation light-brown or purplish-red discoloration from the congestion and back up of the blood in the leg veins. it's sometimes seen more in legs with varicose veins. dyshidrotic eczema: irritation of the skin on the palms of hands (mostly) and less commonly soles of the feet characterized by clear very deep-seated blisters that itch and burn. it's sometimes described as a ""tapioca pudding""-like rash on the palms.",what is the difference between atopic dermatitis and eczema?,['atopic dermatitis'],wmd
sometimes the scale doesnt accurately reflect whats really happening with your body. keep in mind that your weight can fluctuate naturally throughout the course of a day. consider if youve eaten used the restroom or how well hydrated you are; all of which have a physical weight to them that can influence the number on the scale. seeing a change like loss of inches can be a great indicator of progress. see if you notice a more toned appearance or more muscle definition as well. also check to see if your clothes fit differently such as by dropping pants sizes having to take a belt in more notches or shirts being loose or not as tight. these changes in body composition can be viewed as more favorable than actual weight loss recorded on a scale. i wholly encourage you to not just view your progress through solely what the scale shows alone. if you do weigh yourself however it may be best to limit yourself to once per week just so that you can notice any weight loss trends but not enough to where youre obsessing over the numbers. keep the timing of when you weigh yourself the same to establish consistency probably first thing in the morning to help take away confounding variables.,what can be causing me to not see the numbers on the scale to drop but the inches are dropping? . i have incorporated a healthy diet with regular exercise i can see the changes but nothing on the scale changes. stumped,"['vision', 'exercise', 'diet']",wmd

not enough information. i don't know the extent or location of your laceration how long ago was it stitched how it was repaired (type of sutures) and what the medical professional recommended. this answer will need to come from the person who sutured you or you will need to repost with more information. patient-specific recommendations are best so it would not be wise to rely on what other clinicians may recommend. each case is unique. in general you should not swim in a chlorine pool or natural water of any kind after receiving stiches until the wound is completely healed. many doctors recommend keeping the stitched area completely dry for the first  hours to prevent loosening of the stiches. after  hours showering may be permitted. tub soaking is contraindicated as bacteria may enter the sutured area). due to the possibility of infection from bacteria swimmining in lakes and streams with stiches is totally prohibited. hi as we don't know where it is and how big it is no unless its sea water sea water is very good for wounds helps to heal and clean all a the same time. if you cant get to the sea then a couple of handfuls of sea salt in a warm bath will help twice daily. from personal experience sea water aids healing to wounds very quickly in fact just google sea salt and wounds. do hope this helps you. good luck hi as we don't know where or what for i would stick to sea salt baths ss aids healing and cleans the wound all at the same time. for me if you can get in the sea that would be all you should do sea water. from personal experience sea salt water does help getting in the sea daily will heal things very quickly. just google sea salt and wounds. good luck stiches on end of finger not quite  hr ago had five stiches should i wash with soap and water when i take bantage off later today,can i swim in a chlorine pool after having stitches?,['stitches'],wmd

a thorough physical exam and a series of tests may be required to diagnose crohn's disease. blood tests may be done to check for anemia which could indicate bleeding in the intestines. blood tests may also uncover a high white blood cell count which is a sign of inflammation somewhere in the body. by testing a stool sample the doctor can tell if there is bleeding or infection in the intestines. the doctor may do an upper gastrointestinal (gi) series to look at the small intestine. for this test the patient drinks barium a chalky solution that coats the lining of the small intestine before x rays are taken. the barium shows up white on x-ray film revealing inflammation or other abnormalities in the intestine. the doctor may also do a colonoscopy. for this test the doctor inserts an endoscope-a long flexible lighted tube linked to a computer and tv monitor-into the anus to see the inside of the large intestine. the doctor will be able to see any inflammation or bleeding. during the exam the doctor may do a biopsy which involves taking a sample of tissue from the lining of the intestine to view with a microscope. if these tests show crohn's disease more x rays of both the upper and lower digestive tract may be necessary to see how much is affected by the disease.,how is crohn's disease diagnosed?,"[""crohn's disease""]",wmd

vitamin d and  aren't linked in the sense that one causes the other but is relatively common for someone to fall short on both of these vitamins. for example people who don't eat any animal products (vegans) typically need supplemental vitamin d and  either from fortified foods or supplements. both of these vitamins are found primarily found in animal foods although plant-based products can be fortified with d such as soy milk. sunlight is another source of vitamin d. another example would be someone who had gastric bypass surgery -- they are at higher risk for vitamin d and  deficiencies. people with excess weight tend to have lower levels of vitamin d and additional  is needed after this type of surgery because absorption occurs in the stomach. a third example is someone who is elderly. they absorb less vitamin  from food and do not make as much vitamin d from the sun. work with your healthcare provider or a registered dietitian to make sure you are getting enough of both of these vitamins. there isn't a direct link between a deficiency in these two vitamins but it likely represents a common denominator. some vitamins require fat to be absorbed in the intestine. these four vitamins a d e and k require fat and a very low intake can produce a deficiency in them. damage to the pancreas or intestine can also interfere with the absorption of these vitamins. vitamin  requires a few additional modifications in the body to be absorbed. it does not require fat but a factor that is produced in the pancreas however its absorption also requires a healthy pancreas and intestinal lining.,are vit d and vit  deficiency linked?,['b12'],wmd

it's possible you could overcome delayed ejaculation by reducing the number of times you masturbate. masturbation can desensitize the penis resulting in delayed ejaculation during intercourse. please be sure to practice safe sex. using a condom not only helps prevent unwanted pregnancy it helps protect both you and your girlfriend from swapping any sexually transmitted diseases. a condom may not entirely protect you from genital warts or herpes because it doesn't cover all of the skin areas that may come into contact with infected areas. but it's better than no protection at all. if you continue to have problems reaching orgasm during intercourse i'd suggest you consult a psychotherapist who specializes in sex issues. it's possible (though not likely) there's something else going on here besides desensitization of the penis. lastly i should mention that i hope your girlfriend also is at least . otherwise you know your relationship is not exactly ethical (and not legal in many places). and that's no basis for a relationship. wishing you all the best!,if i stop masturbating will it cure delayed ejaculation? . i am an  year old male who has sex with my girlfriend often. i have never finished during sex however. i can only finish when i am masturbating by myself. i do look at a lot of porn also.,"['masturbation', 'delayed ejaculation']",wmd

cataracts occur when the natural clear lens inside the eye located behind the iris becomes cloudy over time. this lens is important for focusing light on the back of the eye (the retina) so that images appear clear and without distortion and the clouding of this lens during cataract formation distorts vision. cataracts are usually a very gradual process of normal aging but can occasionally develop rapidly. they commonly affect both eyes but it is not uncommon for a cataract in one eye to advance more rapidly. cataracts are very common affecting roughly % of people over the age of  and over .  million cataract surgeries are performed in the united states each year. precisely why cataracts occur is unknown; however most cataracts appear to be caused by changes in the protein structures within the lens that occur over many years and cause the lens to become cloudy. rarely cataracts can be present at birth or in early childhood as a result of hereditary enzyme defects. severe trauma to the eye eye surgery or intraocular inflammation can also cause cataracts to develop more rapidly. other factors that may lead to the development of cataracts at an earlier age include excessive ultraviolet light exposure diabetes smoking or the use of certain medications such as oral topical or inhaled steroids. other medications that are more weakly associated with cataracts include the long-term use of statins and phenothiazines. experts have estimated that in the united states visual disability associated with cataracts accounts for over  million physician office visits a year. this number will likely continue to increase as the proportion of people over the age of  rises. when people develop cataracts they begin to have difficulty doing activities they enjoy. some of the most common complaints include difficulty driving at night reading or traveling. these are all activities for which clear vision is essential.,what is a cataract?,['cataract'],wmd

cystic fibrosis (cf) is a chronic progressive condition that affects the body's respiratory and digestive systems. it is due to a gene defect. people who have cf produce abnormally thick sticky mucus which clogs the lungs and leads to repeated lung and sinus infections as well as difficulty breathing. the thick mucus also obstructs the ducts of the pancreas preventing digestive enzymes from reaching the intestines. because so little food is absorbed children with cf have difficulty gaining and maintaining weight. cf also affects the reproductive systems of both males and females. females with cf may have difficulty getting pregnant. males with cf are almost always sterile because they produce relatively few or no sperm.,what is cystic fibrosis?,['cystic fibrosis'],wmd

well it's certainly not a situation anyone wants to be in. extremely low blood sugar levels can lead to coma -- which isn't a good outcome. the quickest remedy for a very low blood sugar level is. sugar. in the hospital we administer dextrose via iv line. assuming you're awake and alert and realize your blood sugar has dipped you can eat a sugary treat such as a small candy bar to bring your sugar level back up. note: no one should attempt to feed sugar to an unconscious or unresponsive person even if you know low blood sugar is the cause. you should call -- or your local emergency number instead. of course it's not a good idea to ever let your blood sugar level get too low. one goal of diabetes management is to maintain blood sugar within a therapeutic range. for adults that might be between  and  milligrams/deciliter (mg/dl). you should try to avoid peaks and valleys in your blood sugar levels. that said if you go around measuring your blood sugar every hour you're going to find you do indeed have some peaks and valleys throughout the day. that's normal. you should measure your blood sugar at the appropriate times and eat a balanced diet that includes several healthy snacks throughout the day to keep your blood sugar as level as possible. if you have any questions about diabetes management ask your doctor or your diabetes nurse educator. they're the experts who can give you all the specific information you need for your personal health situation. wishing you well!,what happens if your blood sugar level falls to ?,['blood sugar'],wmd

acetaminophen is used more as a fever reducer and for pain. ibuprofen which is also known as motrin or advil can be used for pain that's caused by inflammation. so the theory is is that if the area is inflamed that's really what's causing the pain. acetaminophen or tylenol is also referred to as apap in some formulations. you want to be careful. you want to make sure that you don't exceed more than   milligrams a day for an adult. if you are an elderly person you don't want to exceed   milligrams a day and you would want to avoid things like alcohol. they are noticing that there have been some challenges with acetaminophen in the cases of people taking too much of it. they weren't aware that they were taking prescription medications with acetaminophen in it. so you want to talk to your pharmacist first before you consider choosing these products. on the advil/motrin side once again you don't want to drink alcohol with them. it really helps create nausea. it could upset the stomach. if you have an ulcer it's not recommended. if you have asthma it's not recommended either because ibuprofen is a sister to aspirin and it could trigger an asthma attack. that's really some people are very sensitive to this class and that's why they shouldn't be taking it. so once again you want to come to the pharmacy you want to ask for the pharmacist. you want to come with your medication list show us what you are taking and then tell us what are your symptoms. in some cases if you have had a pain for a while we might refer you to a doctor or a healthcare provider to have it further evaluated.,what's the difference between acetaminophen and ibuprofen and what are the dangers of each?,"['ibuprofen', 'acetaminophen']",wmd

a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (ocd) is based on your symptoms medical history and a physical examination. your doctor may also want a mental health assessment which is an evaluation of your emotional functioning and your ability to think reason and remember (cognitive functioning). a mental health assessment may include an examination of your nervous system written or verbal tests and laboratory tests (such as blood and urine tests) as well as a review of your appearance mood behavior thinking reasoning memory and ability to express yourself. many people with ocd live with the condition for years before being diagnosed or they go without treatment because they are afraid or embarrassed to talk about their symptoms. answers to three initial questions may help your health professional diagnose whether you have ocd:  do you have repeated thoughts that cause anxiety and that you cannot get rid of no matter how hard you try? do you wash your hands frequently or keep things extremely clean and neat? do you excessively check things? if your health professional suspects you have ocd he or she will look for a full range of symptoms that will confirm the diagnosis including:  recurrent and persistent thoughts impulses or images that are intrusive and inappropriate cause anxiety or distress and are not simply excessive worries about real-life issues. attempts to suppress or ignore the thoughts or get rid of them with other thoughts or actions. a recognition that the obsessions are created in your own mind and don't make sense. repetitive behaviors such as hand-washing ordering praying or checking that you're driven to do in response to the obsession. the behaviors are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing a dreaded event. for a diagnosis of ocd the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (more than  hour a day) or greatly interfere with your normal routine at work or school and affect social activities and relationships. early detection early detection and proper treatment is very important in improving the course of ocd. this disorder is often a long-lasting (chronic) condition that will need to be monitored throughout your life. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,what exams and tests help doctors to evaluate or test people for obsessive-compulsive disorder ocd?,['obsessive-compulsive disorder'],wmd

i think they generally do and unfortunately men handle it in a way that is counter productive. we have noticed that more men will begin to drink alcohol excessively and that is probably because they want to be seen as strong and if they go to a doctor for any kind of help with this it will mean that they are not men so better to drink and try to drink your troubles away than to try and get some help. women on the other hand will say look if im this stressed ive got to go get some help. we know that more women enter therapy than man. that has always been as long as i can remember and theyve been keeping statistics that women are willing to talk to others and to try to come to terms with how do i cope with this how can i change this what am i missing they will talk about their problems. men will talk about the baseball scores. they wont talk about their problems. thats why the statistics are skewed probably that they say that women have more anxiety and depression than men. no its because more women show up at the office and get counted and men dont get counted. if we went into bars and started doing some kind of research i would wonder before they took their first drink how would they register on stress measures on anxiety depression measures and i think we would find a rather dramatic shift. you know what is stopping them what is so unmanly about getting help when you need it. if you have hypertension and you are a man you go and get help. is that unmanly? no. if you have anxiety and stress that is causing you serious problems and can end up in a heart attack is that unmanly or should you go and get some help just the way you got with your hypertension. remember these kinds of illnesses are just as important and can have as catastrophic results as the medical illnesses that youve accepted all these years.,do men and women handle stress differently?,['stress'],wmd

i'm sorry you're dealing with an abnormal pap smear result. before i get to your questions about hpv let's back up for just a moment. an abnormal pap smear does not necessarily indicate you have human papillomavirus (hpv). the pap test specifically screens women for cervical cancer. an abnormal pap result does not mean you have cervical cancer. in fact most abnormal pap test results are not cancer at all. certainly hpv can cause cervical cancer. however you need to receive a special test (not unlike a pap test actually) in which the cells of your cervix are tested for hpv. in answer to your question hpv is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases. the centers for disease control estimate as many as % of sexually active men and women get hpv at some point in their lives. often people who are infected with it have no symptoms. so while it's not exactly true to say hpv can lie dormant in your system it is accurate to say you can be infected with hpv and live with it for many years without knowing it. your gynecologist probably will want to discuss your abnormal pap test result with you. when that happens you will have the opportunity to discuss your concerns about hpv. i hope you find this response helpful!,can hpv lay dormant in your system and for how long? . can the virus lay dormant in your system and not show up for years later! im married and have been with the same partner for the last  years and all my paps have come back normal until now. this concerns me.,['virus'],wmd
hi i found this for you it may help in your condition ie i mean getting over your problem. its from the uk nhs. how long it is advisable to wait before you try for another pregnancy will depend on your specific circumstances. your doctor should be able to advise you when (or if) it will be safe to do so. in most cases it is recommended that you wait for at least two full menstrual cycles before trying for another pregnancy as this will allow time for your fallopian tubes to recover. however if you were treated with methotrexate it is usually recommended that you wait at least three months. nevertheless many women are not emotionally ready to try for another pregnancy so soon. your chances of having a successful pregnancy will depend on the underlying health of your fallopian tubes. in general % of women achieve a successful pregnancy  months after having an ectopic pregnancy. good luck,iv been trying to get pregnant my ovulation just ended and im spotting! frustrated. i had a eptopic in may and i had my right tube removed will i ever get pregnant,"['pregnancy', 'ovulation', 'spotting']",wmd

the allergic symptoms usually aggravate during winter season. it continues from november till february based on the climate in your place. you have not mentioned about the allergic site (nose or lung or skin). if it is nose or lung the dryness due to winter can trigger the allergic response in nose. in this situation you need to maintain moisture by just applying a drop of coconut oil in each nostril before going to bed. on the other hand you can apply a drop of anu thailam (an ayurvedic nasal drops for allergy) in each nostril before going to bed. during evenings and nights when it is too cold you need to protect your ears (by keeping cotton plug) nose (by applying oil drops) head (by covering head with a woolen cap) and hands and feet (by wearing gloves and socks). the external cold stimulus triggers the allergic response. so prevent yourself from the cold stimulus to avoid allergy. if you have allergic asthma then it is better to practice pranayama and yoga. breathing exercises will help you. if you have allergic skin disorder then you can use vaseline or vegetable oils to gently apply on the skin. this helps in overcoming the dryness due to the cold climate. the skin manifestation should also be examined by a physician to decide the proper medication. revert back to an ayurveda specialist online for further follow up --> <link>,i have chronic allergies which become worse in winter. please suggest ayurvedic medicine.,['allergy'],ic

the diagnosis of inguinal hernia is usually based on your medical history and a physical exam. tests such as ultrasound and ct scans are not usually needed to diagnose an inguinal hernia. in most cases a doctor can identify an inguinal hernia during a physical exam. an examination of urine ( urinalysis ) may be done to rule out a urinary tract infection. a urinary tract infection or kidney stone may cause pain in the groin that can be mistaken for hernia pain. further tests may be done to rule out other conditions that could be contributing to the hernia such as colon or prostate cancer or lung diseases that cause chronic coughing. if surgery is planned other tests may be needed to evaluate the status of any current health problems such as lung heart or bleeding problems. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,what exams and tests help doctors to evaluate or test people for inguinal hernia?,['hernia'],wmd

genital herpes is suspected when multiple painful blisters occur in a sexually exposed area. during the initial outbreak fluid from the blisters may be sent to the laboratory to try and culture the virus but cultures only return a positive result in about % of those infected. in other words a negative test result from a blister is not as helpful as a positive test result because the test may be a false-negative test. however if a sample of a fluid-filled blister (in the early stage before it dries up and crusts) tests positive for herpes the test result is very reliable. cultures taken during an initial outbreak of the condition are more likely to be positive for the presence of hsv than cultures from subsequent outbreaks. there are also blood tests that can detect antibodies to the herpes viruses that can be useful in some situations. these tests are specific for hsv- or hsv- and are able to demonstrate that a person has been infected at some point in time with the virus and they may be useful in identifying infection that does not produce characteristic symptoms. however because false-positive results can occur and because the test results are not always clear-cut they are not recommended for routine use in screening low-risk populations for hsv infection. other diagnostic tests such as polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to identify the genetic material of the virus and rapid fluorescent antibody screening tests are used to identify hsv in some laboratories.,how are genital herpes diagnosed?,['genital herpes'],wmd

testosterone is the major male hormone. there are three different types of blood tests that can be used to measure testosterone levels. so the first step in understanding your level is to find out which test was used and the normal range for men in your age group. total testosterone is the most common test used. it measures all the testosterone in your blood. a typical range for men over  is - ng/dl but the results vary depending on the lab used. you can also measure free testosterone. free testosterone is a measure of the testosterone that is not bound to proteins in the blood. a typical range for men is - ng/dl. obesity affects the level of sex hormone binding proteins so your doctor may order a free testosterone level if you are obese. historically it was thought that only free testosterone was able to exert hormonal effects. we now know that testosterone bound to the protein albumin can also exert effects. bioavailable testosterone measures this level. bioavailable testosterone varies depending on the age of the man. for a man in his s the normal range of bioavailable testosterone would be - ng/dl but for a man in his s it would be - ng/dl. normal ranges differ depending on the laboratory used so be sure to discuss with your doctor what is the appropriate normal range for the lab where the test was done. if your testosterone level is low it is important to re-test the level to determine if a lab error or just a daily variation has occurred. the amount of testosterone varies at different times of the day so this is a blood test that needs to be repeated before making medical decisions. it is always important to make sure lab tests correlates with your symptoms. low testosterone levels in men causes decreased sexual desire erectile dysfunction and infertility. however testosterone also has other important functions. it affects behavior muscle mass and bone density. therefore a man with low testosterone can develop osteoporosis. finally in understanding testosterone levels your doctor needs to determine whether the root of the problem is a result of a problem in the testicles where testosterone is produced or if there is a problem in the part of the brain that controls the production of testosterone. measuring lh and fsh hormones produced in the pituitary of the brain will help make that distinction. once this information is available your doctor can decide how you need to be treated. testosterone replacement in the form of a patch gel or injection is usually given. but as with all medications there are cautions. testosterone can increase the size of the prostate and may cause worsening symptoms in men with benign prostatic hypertrophy and aggravate prostate cancer. so talk with your doctor to understand your test and his concerns.,my testosterone level is a  yet my doctor did not recommend injections. what is going on.?,"['testosterone', 'injection']",wmd

research shows that regular exercise reduces symptoms of moderate depression and enhances psychological fitness. exercise can even produce changes in certain chemical levels in the body which can have an effect on the psychological state. endorphins are hormones in the brain associated with a happy positive feeling. a low level of endorphins is associated with depression. during exercise plasma levels of this substance increase. this may help to ease symptoms of depression. a national health and nutrition survey found that physically active people were half as likely to be depressed. exercise also boosts the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain. neurotransmitters are chemicals that send specific messages from one brain cell to another. though only a small percentage of all serotonin is located in the brain this neurotransmitter is thought to play a key role in keeping your mood calm.,how can exercise affect my mood?,['exercise'],wmd

screening tests are those that are done at regular intervals to detect a disease such as prostate cancer at an early stage. if the result of a screening test is normal the disease is presumed not to be present. if a screening test is abnormal the disease is then suspected to be present and further tests usually are needed to confirm the suspicion (that is to make the diagnosis definitively). prostate cancer usually is suspected initially because of an abnormality of one or both of the two screening tests that are used to detect prostate cancer. these screening tests are a digital rectal examination and a blood test called the prostate specific antigen (psa). in the digital rectal examination the doctor feels (palpates) the prostate gland with his gloved index finger in the rectum to detect abnormalities of the gland. thus a lump irregularity or hardness felt on the surface of the gland is a finding that is suspicious for prostate cancer. accordingly doctors usually recommend doing a digital rectal examination in men age  and over. the psa test is a simple reproducible and relatively accurate blood test. it is used to detect a protein (the prostate specific antigen) that is released from the prostate gland into the blood. the psa level is usually higher than /ml in people with prostate cancer than in people without the cancer. situations of large prostate size infection and inflammation are other reasons why the psa may be elevated. the psa therefore is valuable as a screening test for prostate cancer. accordingly doctors usually recommend doing a psa in men age  and over. subsequent screening is recommended based on individual preference and assessment of risk for developing prostate cancer. for example patients with a high risk of developing prostate cancer due to a family history or a high initial psa should have more frequent evaluation (usually annually). although still considered controversial most urologists recommend regular screening for prostate cancer in men who are likely to live for more than  years. the american urological association (aua) issued their latest guidelines for prostate cancer in . according to these men at the age of  should be offered a baseline psa test and a prostate exam (digital rectal exam or dre) to ascertain the risk of prostate cancer. subsequent screening and tests may be performed according to the findings on this initial evaluation and an individual's risk of getting the disease on the basis of other factors such as race ethnicity and family history of prostate cancer. as mentioned most urologists currently would advise some form of screening in men with a life expectancy greater than  years. most frequently it would be performed on an annual basis. although there is no definite cutoff age to stop prostate cancer screening most physicians would rarely screen men more than  years of age for this disease. results of the psa test under  nanograms per milliliter of blood are generally considered normal. there is a recent trend however to perform prostate biopsy in all patients with a psa more than .  ng/ml in order to detect prostate cancer at an earlier (and hopefully completely curable) stage. the american urological association guidelines () do not define a definite cutoff point but advise that all the other risk factors for prostate cancer should be taken into account while making a decision on whether to proceed for a biopsy. one of the important factors that needs to be considered is the rate at which the psa value has increased over time on repeated measurements (psa velocity). results between  and  are considered borderline. these borderline values are interpreted in the context of the patient's age symptoms signs family history and changes in the psa levels over time. results higher than  are considered abnormal suggesting the possibility of prostate cancer. it has been shown that the higher the psa value the more likely the diagnosis of prostate cancer. moreover the level of psa tends to increase when the cancer has progressed from organ-confined prostate cancer to local spread to distant (metastatic) spread. very high values such as  or  and over are usually caused by prostate cancer.,what are the screening tests for prostate cancer?,"['screening', 'prostate cancer']",wmd

"usually it is not difficult to diagnose gallstones. problems arise however because of the high prevalence of silent gallstones and the occasional gallstone that is difficult to diagnose. if a patient has symptoms that are typical for gallstones for example biliary colic cholecystitis or pancreatitis and has gallstones on ultrasonography little else usually can or needs to be done to demonstrate that the gallstones are causing the episode unless the patient has complicating medical issues. if episodes are not typical for gallstones however any gallstones found may be silent. these silent gallstones may be innocent bystanders and most importantly removing the gallbladder surgically will not treat the acute problem or prevent further episodes. in addition the real cause of the problem will not be pursued. in such a situation there is a need to have further evidence other than their mere presence that the gallstones are causing the episode. such evidence can be obtained during an episode or shortly thereafter. if ultrasonography can be done during an episode of pain or inflammation caused by gallstones it may be possible to demonstrate an enlarged gallbladder or bile duct caused by obstruction of the ducts by the gallstone. this is likely to require ultrasonography again after the episode has resolved in order to demonstrate that the gallbladder indeed was larger during the episode than before or after the episode. it is easier to obtain the necessary ultrasonography if the episode lasts several hours but it is much more difficult to obtain ultrasonography rapidly enough if the episode lasts only  minutes. another approach is to test the blood for abnormal liver and pancreatic enzymes. the advantage here is that the enzymes though not always elevated can be elevated during and for several hours after an episode of gallstone-related pain or inflammation so they might be abnormal even after the episode has subsided. it is important to remember however that the enzymes are not specific for gallstones and it is necessary to exclude other liver and pancreatic causes for abnormal enzymes. sometimes episodes of pain or inflammation may be more or less typical of gallstones but transabdominal ultrasonography may not demonstrate either gallstones or another cause of the episodes. in this case it is necessary to decide whether suspicion is high or low for gallstones as a cause of the episodes. if suspicion is low because of less-typical symptoms it may be reasonable only to repeat the ultrasonography obtain an ocg and/or test for abnormalities of liver or pancreatic enzymes. if suspicion is high because of more typical symptoms it is reasonable to go even further with endoscopic ultrasonography ercp and duodenal drainage. prior to these ""invasive"" procedures some physicians recommend mrcp; however the exact role of mrcp is not yet clear.",what are the potential pitfalls of diagnosing gallstones?,['gallstone'],wmd

"most helpful answer this is a great question and one you should ask your health care provider. it's a bit too involved to go into here but i'll briefly outline some (not all) of the options. and luckily webmd offers this handy comparison of some common blood pressure medications. a water pill or diuretic (such as hydrochlorothiazide or furosemide) lowers blood pressure by getting rid of excess water in your system. this essentially lowers your overall blood volume. if you have tinnitus (or ringing in the ears) you should talk to your health care provider about using a ""potassium-sparing"" water pill because the other type can make tinnitus worse. ace (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors have become a popular choice. these medications basically cause your blood vessels to relax which lowers your blood pressure. these medications usually have few side effects. beta blockers work by slowing down the pace of your heartbeat and also reducing the force at which the heart contracts. this combination causes your blood pressure to come down. if your doctor suggests a beta blocker be sure to get specific dosing instructions. some beta blockers shouldn't be taken when your pulse rate is low. again you ask a good question for your doctor. if you go on a blood pressure medication be sure to know what it does (specifically) why it's a good choice for you and what possible side effects you should watch out for. hope this helps!",i may begin bp medication in the near future. what are the different classes of bp meds and the pros/cons of each.,"['exercise', 'smoking']",wmd

"""it depends on the doctor's relationship with the insurance company "" says richard e. ungar a los angeles-based health-care attorney. that relationship can make the difference between balance billing (not allowed) and billing you for a balance you owe (completely kosher). is your doc in or out? a health-care provider who is in-network with your insurance company has negotiated a price for his or her medical services and signed a contract with your insurer agreeing to those rates as payment in-full. with the exception of your co-pay deductible or coinsurance in-network providers generally cannot charge you more for their services. doing so is considered balance billing whether or not you've signed a form stating you'll pay the balance of what your insurer won't. but that's not the end of the story. there are scenarios in which you may be required to pay beyond what your insurance company will even if the doctor is in your carrier's network. duped by details there are details consumers commonly overlook about the rules of their insurance coverage that cause trouble says marty rosen executive vice president and co-founder of health advocate a healthcare advocacy and assistance organization. forgetting the common requirement to pre-certify services before receiving care is a frequent mistake. another is not confirming ahead of time whether you're being treated by doctors in your insurance carrier's network. ""failure to do so may result in denial of coverage by your insurance company and thus large out-of-pocket fees "" rosen says. also watch for certain elements of a doctor's visit that your insurance coverage may not cover ungar warns. for example let's say you see an in-network doctor for a routine colonoscopy. both the doctor visit and the procedure may be fully covered by your insurer. but if your doctor decides to use a newer sedative that requires an anesthesiologist to administer it (as opposed to doing it herself) unger says you could be on the hook for the anesthesiologist's charges. in order to avoid unnecessary health care costs before you get care: * make sure the service you need is covered. * determine exactly what the contracted service includes. * confirm that the doctor is in your network. and don't sign any documents you don't understand or don't feel comfortable with.",what are your legal obligations to pay your doctor for treatment above and beyond what your insurance will pay?,['insurance'],wmd

when it comes to an insurer's decision to pay for any procedure the main issue is always whether it's considered medically necessary. while breast augmentation for the sake of vanity is not a covered service generally if a procedure is necessary to repair or preserve the healthy functioning of the body it's likely to be medically necessary. having said that the only way to know for certain is to ask your insurance carrier. rules vary from one plan to next. you'll likely need to get your health plan's authorization before having any surgery done. and you should work with your doctor to obtain medical records and other supporting materials that justify the procedure from a medical standpoint.,silicone implants are  years old have scar tissue now will insurance coverage the surgery to fix this condition? . the implants are feeling very tight somewhat uncomfortable would this be a reason for insurance to cover new surgery.,"['scar', 'insurance', 'surgery', 'tightness']",wmd
in most areas of the united states and canada fetal toxoplasmosis infection is rare. in the u. s. about  to  infants per   actually become infected before birth.  this is why screening for toxoplasmosis is not a part of routine prenatal care in this country. but getting tested for toxoplasmosis may be a good idea if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant and: you are worried that you might get toxoplasmosis. you think you may not be able to avoid exposure to the parasite. consider what higher-risk countries recommend as you make your decision about testing: in countries where toxoplasmosis risk is moderate all newborns are screened for toxoplasmosis infection. some states in the u. s. now screen all newborns for toxoplasmosis. in some countries where toxoplasmosis risk is high all pregnant women are screened for toxoplasmosis antibodies. a blood test is used to see whether you have the antibody to the toxoplasma parasite. if you have the antibody that means you have already been infected and your immune system now makes antibodies that can fight toxoplasma. these antibodies protect your fetus and newborn from infection. you may need more than one blood test to make sure the result is accurate. tests for toxoplasmosis toxoplasmosis blood test looks for the antibody to toxoplasma. if test results or symptoms show possible infection another test is done  to  weeks later to confirm the diagnosis. amniocentesis is used to collect amniotic fluid for testing. a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) test is used on the fluid to check for signs of toxoplasma dna. this test can detect fetal toxoplasmosis. fetal ultrasound is used to check for signs of toxoplasmosis damage in the fetus. early detection birth defects are most likely to develop when a fetus is infected during weeks  through  of pregnancy.  this is why early detection and treatment of fetal toxoplasmosis is important for preventing severe fetal problems. (if an infection develops later in pregnancy severe fetal problems are less likely but treatment is important to prevent future problems. ) webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,what exams and tests help doctors to evaluate or test people for toxoplasmosis during pregnancy?,"['toxoplasmosis', 'pregnancy']",wmd

"in addition to the depth of the burn the total area of the burn is significant. burns are measured as a percentage of total body area affected. the ""rule of nines"" is often used though this measurement is adjusted for infants and children. this calculation is based upon the fact that the surface area of the following parts of an adult body each correspond to approximately % of total (and the total body area of % is achieved): head = %. chest (front) = %. abdomen (front) = %. upper/mid/low back and buttocks = %. each arm = %. each palm = %. groin = %. each leg = % total (front = % back = %). as an example if both legs (% x  = %) the groin (%) and the front chest and abdomen were burned this would involve % of the body. only second and third degree burn areas are added together to measure total body burn area. while first degree burns are painful the skin integrity is intact and it is able to do its job with fluid and temperature maintenance. if more %-% of the body is involved in a burn significant fluid may be lost. shock may occur if inadequate fluid is not provided intravenously. as the percentage of burn surface area increases the risk of death increases as well. patients with burns involving less than % of their body should do well but those with burns involving greater than % have a significant mortality risk depending upon a variety of factors including underlying medical conditions and age.",what is the significance of the amount of body area burned?,['burn'],wmd

parents are relegated to determine if a child has a possible ear infection based solely on symptoms and signs . those of us in the clinical trenches know that symptoms and signs are not necessarily predictive of a definitive diagnosis. a recent two-year study in finland looked at  children ages - months and tested the predictive value of common middle ear infection symptoms: ear-rubbing or pulling irritability less playful excessive crying poor appetite restless sleep runny nose congestion vomiting diarrhea and fever. the diagnosis of a middle ear infection (otitis media) requires a certain diagnostic criteria: middle ear fluid detected by pneumatic otoscopy — this is the little bulb syringe attached to the otoscope that puffs air against the eardrum to check for mobility (the normal in and out movement of the eardrum). abnormal color opacity bulging (shape) of the eardrum. middle ear infections are typically bulging and have a distinct red or yellow color instead of shiny white. in this study not one but three different physicians systematically examined the ears of children strongly suspected by the parents as having a middle ear infection based on symptoms alone. the results: the duration and severity of the symptoms were not predictive of a middle ear infection. ear-rubbing and pulling long thought to be predictive of ear pain was proven to be an invalid sign. it was actually more common in children who did not have a middle ear infection. fever was also not a predictive sign. a prior cold was not a predictive sign in this study although statistically most children who get middle ear infection usually do have a cold. conjunctivitis (pink eye) may be a presumptive sign in some not all cases. the only definitive way to diagnose a child with a middle ear infection is by a careful systematic medical examination by an experienced clinician using a pneumatic otoscope. i see these false alarms nearly every day in my clinical practice. parents believe their children have an ear infection when in reality they do not. many parents will still demand antibiotics just in case  or come up with some compelling stories like going out of town tomorrow a seriously ill grandparent or upcoming air travel in an effort to plead their case. cursory or incomplete examinations by hurried clinicians tend to over-read ear examination findings resulting in inaccurate diagnoses. i find this quite often in emergency room or urgent care visits. here are  facts about ear infection: . not all middle ear infections in children (not including babies under the age of three months) require antibiotics. as a matter of fact over  percent of middle ear infections will self-resolve in a few days on their own without any medical intervention. shocking. it is perfectly fine to wait a few days to see if the bodys immune system orchestrates the cure. . middle ear infections hurt. regardless of the presence of fever (harmless) a child in pain should be treated with acetaminophen (tylenol) or ibuprofen (advil motrin) at an appropriate dose for the pain not the fever. . fever is harmless and does not need to be treated in most cases. . middle ear infections are not emergencies. they really have no place in the emergency room. . not all recurrent ear infection will result in children getting tubes. however if middle ear fluid is present for more than three months and/or children are having hearing loss an ent specialist should be consulted. . children in daycare get more ear infections. the fall and winter months have the highest incidence. . children exposed to any secondary cigarette smoke get more ear infections. (if you smoke around your children you should be arrested. ) . children who are breast-fed for at least six months get less ear infections that bottle-fed babies. . children who have a nighttime bottle in the crib or depend on a pacifier tend to have more ear infections. . children do grow out of ear infections. we see a marked reduction after age six so hang in there. now go buy a home otoscope and start practicing.,what are the symptoms and signs of an ear infection in children?,['ear infection'],wmd

the symptoms of prostate enlargement really are manifest by two different factors. one is the actual size. as the gland gets bigger its harder to push the urine through. the other cause for symptoms for men with signs of prostate enlargement isnt really the size of the gland but the fact that the gland and surrounding tissues are involved with smooth muscle. its part of the normal architecture that those muscles squeeze down. so as they squeeze the urethra they block the flow as well and thats another whole category of medications called alpha blockers that relax those muscles. the advantage to the alpha blockers is that they work very quickly men have remarkable improvement in their urinating symptoms almost within days and often avoid the need for any surgical intervention. the problem with the alpha blockers is they might not last as long so maybe after a year or two or three the symptoms might start to come back. thats where the  alpha-reductase inhibitors come into play the avodart and the proscar and that they actually shrink the gland. and sometimes the combination of the two is what has the most success for some men. sl: what are the side effects? the avodart and the proscar have a very low incidence of side effects that are sexual. the main ones are sometimes an increase in sex drive sometimes a decrease in sexual ability and for many men a decrease in volume of ejaculate because youre shrinking the glandular structure. for the alpha blockers their main side effect is that they relax the smooth muscle so depending on whether youre using a new one or an old one some men can have problems with blood pressure and also retrograde ejaculation where because the bladder neck is relaxed when the man ejaculates the semen goes backwards into the bladder. sl: that doesnt sound very good. its retrograde ejaculation is generally its painless. men though become very obsessed with how things should be and when theres changes such as reduced volume they become upset with that and want to restore it.,how can i know if my prostate is enlarged?,['prostate'],wmd

strep cannot be accurately diagnosed by the severity of the sore throat — it requires both a hands-on medical examination and a lab test for confirmation. medical providers who feel they can just look in the throat and accurately diagnose strep tend to be wrong half of the time; not much better than a coin toss. there are some suspicious signs of strep that one can notice by simply looking at the throat. many people get all excited when they see white stuff on the tonsils. this is not a definite sign of strep and can even be food particles. strep tends to cause petechiae — tiny irregularly-shaped red dots appearing on the back of the palate and on or near the uvula. the back of the throat and palate area is usually an angry-looking fire-engine red. the kids look and act sick. their breath smells like they have never used a toothbrush in their life. for those clinicians who have spent their careers insulted by this strep smell we usually have a pretty good idea that this child probably has strep. i still test them. if the rapid strep test is surprisingly negative (it is not %) i tend to get a throat culture. a culture takes two days but the accuracy approaches  percent. streptococcal infections have a bad historical reputation since it has the potential to cause heart-damaging rheumatic fever kidney disease life-threatening pneumonia and other serious complications. the reason why we treat strep when we diagnosis is to prevent these complications that are relatively rare now. if you have a good immune system our bodies can easily overcome an occasional attack of strep. kids who are excluded from school with strep should have at least  hours of treatment and show improvement before returning to school. treatment with antibiotics usually a penicillin-based one if you are not allergic to them will last about  days. there is really no need to keep children home that long. i always recommend that they change their toothbrush after a day of treatment since strep can colonize on wet toothbrushes. if you have several kids who keep their toothbrushes in the same drawer touching it is the same as sharing toothbrushes. for the teenagers i warn them about taking a clandestine swig out of the milk or orange juice container in the refrigerator when no one is watching. if a sore throat persists more than a week or so accompanied by fatigue a mono test should be considered.,what are the symptoms of strep throat?,['strep throat'],wmd

there are problems with the fat burning option on the cardio machines and it really ought to be eliminated. the idea behind the fat-burning option is this: because fat is denser than carbohydrate it requires more oxygen to burn. so to maximize the percentage of fat you burn compared to carbohydrate the fat-burning mode would have you work out at a pace at which your body can deliver lots of oxygen to your muscles. that generally means a slow pace to keep you from getting breathless. the problem is that when you exercise at a slower speed you burn fewer total calories -- from both carbohydrate and fat -- because you simply don't do as much work. further the way to get aerobically fit is to get your heart rate into the training range (usually % to % of your maximum heart rate) which is hard to do at slower speeds. and fitness is ultimately what you're after whether your goals are better health burning calories or improving heart and lung capacity. the bottom line is that the fat-burning mode probably won't be intense enough to maximize total calorie- or fat-burning or to help you increase or maintain optimum fitness levels. use the cardio mode to maximize your exercise benefits.,what's the difference between the fat-burning mode and the cardio mode on the machines at the gym?,['burn'],wmd

corticosteroid injections commonly are given to relieve pain in the joints such as the elbow or the neck. the medication works by reducing inflammation which in turn can relieve pressure on a nerve and reduce pain. a corticosteroid shot for joint or soft tissue pain should not cause any side effect like indigestion. generally speaking the medication stays in the local area of the injection and does not travel throughout the body. corticosteroids also can be administered by injection into a vein. this type of injection is used to treat an allergic reaction or asthma. while it's unlikely this type of steroid injection would cause indigestion it's not impossible. if you received a cortisone shot for joint pain then your heartburn likely is not related. hope this helps!,will a cortisone shot cause indigestion or heartburn?,"['cortisone', 'indigestion', 'heartburn']",wmd

this is a great question. but of course as a pharmacist i have to ask the patient a few questions too because we need to find out what is the root cause. could this be more of a virus running around and causing that nausea and vomiting because in that case it's really just flat coca-cola syrup over some ice and just letting it pass. if it becomes very violent though and they haven't been able to keep any food or water down you have to go in the emergency room because dehydration could cause more problems down the road. so you want to be really careful about that. if you are pregnant once again you can't really take the over-the-counter products that are available such as meclizine basically known as dramamine or also bonine. bonine is a chewable form of the product. these are not safe in pregnant women so therefore they have to go more the natural route. they could possibly try; there is a wristband that they could wear around their wrist to help prevent that as well. but if it's just for motion sickness because it was on a boat; which is very common for people or a train. the products that are available; dramamine and bonine are quite effective. they may cause a little bit of tiredness because they are actually antihistamines and by causing the drowsiness they are actually calming down the center in your brain that causes the nausea and vomiting. but once again as a pharmacist i am going to ask my patients a few questions first before i can help you find the right choice.,are there any over-the-counter solutions for nausea and vomiting?,"['nausea', 'vomit', 'over the counter']",wmd

water therapy (hydrotherapy or aqua therapy) is a program of exercises performed in a large pool. water therapy may be easier on painful joints from psoriatic arthritis because the water takes some of the weight off the affected areas. appropriate recreational exercise also may be beneficial but only if it is preceded by a program of range-of-motion strength and aerobic exercises to reduce the chance of injury. regardless of the exercise program you select it's important to choose one you enjoy so that you maintain it. before beginning any new exercise program discuss exercise options with your doctor. also begin new exercise programs under the supervision of a physical therapist or qualified professional preferably one who has experience working with psoriatic arthritis patients. furthermore it's important to know that improper exercise programs may worsen psoriatic arthritis. check with your doctor or therapist before starting an exercise program and adjust your program if you experience any of the following: unusual or persistent fatigue. increased weakness. decreased range of motion. increased joint swelling. continuing pain (lasting more than an hour after exercising).,does water therapy ease the pain of psoriatic arthritis?,"['pain', 'psoriatic arthritis']",wmd

"yes this can be common as it can take up to two years after the first period for the ovaries to completely mature and produce regular ovulations every month. in the early years of menstruation estrogen production is more than adequate to build up a thickened lining in the uterus. but without regular ovulations not enough progesterone is made. as you may know in a normal cycle estrogen is produced all month. estrogen is responsible for building up the lining of your uterus so you have something to shed each month. in a normal cycle progesterone production increases following ovulation. progesterone ""stabilizes"" the uterine lining in preparation for a possible implantation of a new pregnancy. if you are not pregnant that month the levels of estrogen and progesterone fall triggering the release of the uterine lining—your period. so if you do not ovulate the estrogen build up of the lining continues but without the usual ovulation associated progesterone. thus the hormone levels don't decline and the lining stays up inside the uterus as a missed/late period. alternatively the lining can begin to shed under its own weight producing prolonged and erratic bleeding--this is likely what has happened to her. another way inadequate progesterone production from missed ovulations can create too heavy a flow is as follows. simply stated if the uterine lining is like grass or lawn estrogen is like the fertilizer (causes proliferation and a thickening of the lining ) and progesterone is like the lawnmower (keeps the lining thin by three different mechanisms). this is why depoprovera (high dose synthetic progesterone) brings about a thin lining and why birth control pills (relatively progesterone dominant) bring about shorter lighter periods. it is also why women who miss ovulations (no progesterone produced) are at a greater risk for too thick lining. lastly less than % of adolescent women with heavy menstrual bleeding have an undiagnosed blood clotting disorder. this would be more likely if she had a family history of von willebrand's syndrome. given the duration of her bleeding i would urge you to have her see either your gyn a pediatrician or your family md. a short course of hormones may be helpful in stopping this distressing bleeding pattern yes it is nothing to worry about. this could mean instead of one egg a month she produces . i get mine every  das alsoand always have and i am . my mom had the same thing.",my  year old recently started her period. she has a period every  days and it lasts for six days. is this normal?,['period'],wmd

i have always felt that redheads were special. anyone can have blonde brown or black hair but only a select few have red hair. i only knew two redheads as a child — sam and of course linda. i had serious thing for redheaded linda when i was in sixth grade. throughout history redheads were either revered or burned at the stake as witches. warts moles and freckles (common in redheads) were also considered signs of the devil by  century when they murdered about   of those afflicted solving the mystery why redheads were becoming scarce in those days. an old medical colleague rick had a real thing for redheads. we could be in a crowded conference room with a few hundred people. should a redhead walk-in his red-dar would start beeping and he would swoop over and make his move. it is apparently lucky to rub your hand on a redheads hair but dont try this on a strange woman at the mall or you may end up in jail. your amorous cellmate could have red hair. this would not be considered lucky. we now have four grandchildren with one on the way. two are redheads and not that subtle red that only parents can see. i am talking about real red (orange actually). my eldest stepson the father of these two redheads was not pleased. for most of his childhood he made it his mission to make fun of redheads mostly his carrot-topped friend bryan. it was a bit of poetic justice that he now has two of his own. red hair is one of lifes most pleasant genetic mutations. of the zillions of genes carried by humans only one — melanocortin  receptor — can cause red hair. in order to have a child born with red hair both parents must carry this gene mutation. in countries swimming with redheads this is going to happen more often. we were absolutely surprised and even questioned paternity when our two grandchildren emerged both from different mothers. working in pediatrics now i see a fair share of cute little redheads in my office. there are some redhead mothers too but one can never be sure these are natural redheads. i have learned not to ask. parents are particularly proud of their redheaded kids and like it when someone comments on how special it is. i keep hearing about a redhead personality  like mischievousness temperamental or feisty but i cant say i buy into that theory. for some unknown reason redheads require more general anesthesia (up to % more) than people with other hair colors. bees tend to sting redheads more and of course redheads (due to their fair skin) have a higher incidence of sunburns and skin cancers. less than % of the population is redheads with the highest percentage in scotland followed by ireland. about ten years ago my wife and i traveled to the british isles — england scotland wales and ireland — and saw this firsthand. redheads are quite prominent in australia too. these geographic areas are redhead central so i was puzzled when i heard that the future of human redheads may be genetically threatened in the next century. we cant have that.  incidentally there are no redheads in red china. of course a world without redheads is unlikely. the future may allow people to know the genetic make-up of their intended spouse thereby increasing the chance of having redheads in reducing the chance of say; having a child with big ugly feet like dad. i grew up with the humor of lucille ball a famous redhead who was enhanced by a bottle of henna. other famous redheads range from wilma flintstone the little mermaid little orphan annie ronald mcdonald bozo the clown raggedy ann (and andy) red (of course) skelton and carol burnett to such contemporary redheads as sarah ferguson and nicole kidman. if you were lucky enough to be born a redhead you have my admiration and respect. consider yourself special but not an endangered species. i would not want to live in a world without redheads so redheads of the worldunite!

i'm sorry you're going through this. navigating the health care system can be very frustrating indeed! let me start by saying osteoporosis in and of itself can be quite painful. therefore it is possible there's nothing else wrong with your husband's shoulder. still i can understand your concern and desire to get further testing done. try not to be too hard on your husband's physicians. part of the problem may be his insurance carrier. if nothing showed up on x-ray your husband's insurance may not cover an mri. that's not the doctor's fault; that's just the rules set forth by the insurance company. that said if you want to push for further imaging studies ask to be referred to an orthopedic surgeon. a shoulder fracture may require surgical repair so it's not necessarily an unreasonable request. i wish you and your husband all the best in getting this sorted out. if the doctor said to go to the er and you did. let the doctor know this and therefore you've done what he told you to do. he should order the mri. my step mother had extreme pain in her shoulder and because of insurance purposes it took a minute or two before the doctor ordered the mri. finally she's doing great after he gave her a shot in her shoulder. sometimes you have to keep at him!,can't get proper medical care. help! . husband having debilitation shoulder pain x-rays show nothing. just diagnosed with osteoperosis. the reason for test was mutiple fractured ribs they did not see on x-rays found those on mri. he's  has spinal stenosis degenerative disc disease. doc will not order mri for shoulder cause nothing on x-ray. we reminded doc they had to do mri to find rib fractures. doc told him if pain gets worse go to er; er said he needed to see doc. wtf! what specialist do we tell the doc to refer him too?,"['degenerative disc disease', 'osteoporosis', 'fracture', 'shoulder', 'x-ray']",wmd

treatment for chickenpox (varicella) depends on a person's age health and severity of the illness. healthy children with chickenpox may need only home treatment. this includes taking acetaminophen (such as tylenol ) or ibuprofen (such as advil) to reduce fever and discomfort. if you are not sure about the amount of medicine to give your child talk to your doctor or pharmacist. ( do not give aspirin to people younger than  because of the risk of reye syndrome ). over-the counter oral antihistamines may help reduce itching. but check with your child's doctor before giving them to your child. oatmeal baths and soothing lotions that don't contain antihistamines may also help. examples of lotions to use include calamine lotion or aveeno. healthy teens and adults with chickenpox usually have more severe symptoms than children and are at higher risk for complications than children. still most need only home treatment. all teens and adults with chickenpox should be seen by a health professional; some may need hospital care. pregnant women and people with immune system problems are also at increased risk for complications. they should see a health professional immediately if they suspect they have chickenpox. getting a shot of chickenpox antibodies may help delay or prevent a person from having chickenpox. and sometimes antiviral medicines are given to shorten the length of the illness. if you have not had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine and you think you've been exposed to the virus you may be able to get the chickenpox vaccine (what is a pdf document? ). this may prevent you from having the illness or make the illness milder. it is recommended that the vaccine be given within  days after exposure to chickenpox. if you can't get the shot within  days getting it up to  hours ( days) after exposure may still help.  webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,how is chickenpox varicella treated?,['chickenpox'],wmd

a pregnancy test only reacts to the pregnancy hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hcg). however if you are pregnant this hormone will not be present in your urine or blood until  to  days after ovulation (the release of an egg) which is around the time that you would normally get your period. until this time has passed it will not be possible to see a positive result in a pregnancy test. urine tests require a certain level of hcg to be present in order to indicate a positive pregnancy result. blood tests are more sensitive because they can detect a smaller amount of hcg which means that pregnancies can be picked up earlier usually between six to eight days after ovulation. you can have a blood test at your gp surgery but it is recommended that you take a home urine test before booking an appointment. source :- pharmacysell.,had a period in april spotted may no period june and nothing for july yet. took a hpt  ago negative. pregnant? . had sex recently gained weight during this time and very bad stomach ache  day for the last two months. had cramping with no period,"['period', 'pregnancy', 'sexual intercourse', 'weight gain', 'stomach']",wmd

if you always experience a lack of periods (amenorrhea) when your weight drops below a certain point then that is a sign that your lower weight is not enough to sustain normal periods. while estrogen often decreases when body fat and weight dips too low that may not always be the case. the female body needs a certain percentage of body fat to allow the hormones to work properly. this mixed with strenuous exercise and perhaps a diet lacking in key nutrients and calories is enough to keep your body from having periods. my suggestion to you is to see a registered dietitian who specializes in sports nutrition. they can look at your diet activity level and weight and provide recommendations to stay healthy which includes regular periods. you can find a dietitian near you at eatright. org. good luck and take care of yourself!,seconday amenorrhea with normal hormone panel. i am a female athlete with low body fat. when i hit a certain weight i always experience secondary amenorrhea. as i have been below this weight for a significant amount of time i have not had a period in .  years. i did a full hormone panel and all tests were normal. how can all my hormone levels be normal yet i am not menstrating? i have spoken with two doctors and they cannot explain this to me. additionally i have no other symptoms (i. e. acne increased hair growth etc).,"['acne', 'secondary amenorrhea', 'hair', 'weight', 'hormone']",wmd
at the beach not only do i tend to sleep even better than normal many of the people i meet tend to tell me about how well they are sleeping here. sitting in the cool breeze listening to the ocean and watching my kids surf and build sand castles i thought about why everyone seems to sleep better at the beach. here are my thoughts on the phenomenon: . the environment. remember you are on vacation. this in and of itself is a time for relaxation (hopefully) and a change of sleep environment (one which lacks the reminders of your daily stress) certainly helps set the tone for more relaxation and usually better sleep. . the schedule. many of my patients tell me that they have a tendency to sleep in on vacation thus catching up on their much-needed rest and reducing their sleep deprivation. . the heat. being out in the sun all day always makes people sleepy. why? well it may be because of the slight rise in core body temperature. remember an increase in body temp will cause a subsequent fall and that can be a signal to the brain to release melatonin — the key that starts the engine for sleep. . the sounds. remember ocean sounds are the only documented sounds that have been shown to help with sleep. try sleeping with the window slightly open to hear the ocean. . the activity. most people at the beach are doing one of many activities of a physical nature. i was inspired to go for an early morning run not to mention lugging all the beach paraphernalia setting up the umbrella swimming tennis you name it. there are so many activities to choose from. and it is great to be able to exercise which we know can help promote better sleep. . the weather. not only may the heat help with sleep but the barometric pressure could be helpful as well. while there is little data yet (one or two studies) my theory is that the changes to sea level affect the body and in fact help with sleep onset and sleep continuity. . the light. lets face it being out in the sun during the day is one of the best ways to reset your internal biological clock which helps regulate your sleep cycle. so there you have it my seven reasons for better sleep at the beach. whatever the reason my prescription is for anyone if they can get out to the beach and get some great sleep.,why do i sleep so well at the beach?,[],wmd

smoking and pulmonary exertion can definitely effect asthma. if you have been told you may have it in the past my advice would be this; . put down the cigs and avoid smoke strong smells and fast temp changes (i. e. stepping out of a warm car into cold air. ) . start deep breathing exercises. my doctor had me start with just ten a day. he said to find a quiet relaxing place where i can time my breaths. breath in slowly and deeply until it is uncomfortable and hold it until you can't. do this ten times timing each trying to hold it the same amount with each breath. each night try holding it a little longer. you will be amazed how well this will help . check with a doctor. your lungs are just one of the things that may be causing shortness of breath. you may need an inhaler to help open your pulmonary tubes. . ask ten smokers over  when they started and why. also ask if they had it to do over again would they do the same. both my kids tried smoking in college. after doing the math on how much the habit will cost in a life time and talking to experienced smokers they both decided to stop before it became additive and believe me no matter how little you use cigs they will become additive. good luck! and use your head!,asthma. i was to be treated for asthma when i was younger for maybe a year. now i am  and have recently been having trouble breathing when walking across campus or up stairs. i am not overweight. i have been smoking cigarettes occasionally though. could this be bringing back the symptoms of asthma?,"['asthma', 'walking', 'corpulence', 'smoking']",wmd

last week i did one of my teaching stints at the usc medical school. we work with medical students to teach them how to examine the nose and other structures of the face head and neck. were not teaching them cosmetic surgery; that is not appropriate for undergraduate medical students. it is appropriate and important for them to understand the anatomy of the structures of the face including the nose the nasal passages and even the sinuses. once you are a specialist – particularly a superspecialist – you forget how difficult it is to master early in your studies even the simple examination of the nose. to be able to coordinate using an instrument to open the nostrils and a light to look in and to understand what you are seeing isnt so simple when you are only a sophomore or junior medical student. interestingly the technology available hasnt changed much since i was a medical student; there is just no substitute for some of the simple things that are used that can fit into your pocket. yes the light bulbs are stronger and the batteries last longer but other than that the instruments that comprise the head and neck diagnostics for looking into noses ears and eyes havent changed much. it is interesting to listen to the students and to observe their amazement when we explain to them that they need to master the examination of the ears and the nose and even the mouth because % of human illnesses take place in the head and neck. common things do occur commonly such as the common cold.  we train our students to master the techniques of asking the right questions when a patient presents with some symptoms. for example if a patient comes in with a blocked nose it is very important that the young doctor learn to ask about a history of nasal allergies. what about the history of a broken nose? when did you start to have trouble breathing? is it at night only? do you have more trouble in certain environments? for example is arizona better for your nose than california? is it worse in the summer versus the winter? have you been using nose sprays? what medications have you tried? has anything been helpful? you see medical practice has a certain commonality regardless of specialty. the doctor must be a good listener and pose good and meaningful questions. now you know why sir arthur conan doyle a physician was the author of the sherlock holmes books. a wise doctor and a savvy detective follow the same rules.,why should i expect my doctor to be a good listener?,[],wmd

the single worst thing you can do to a pimple is pick. these are not surgical instruments you should not be doing this to your skin. so i do prefer those blackhead removing tools over using your fingers and a tissue. but i also think that this is something that should be done by your dermatologist in order to have the best chance at extracting the contents of that blackhead without leaving a scar. so anytime you pick at the skin in any way; whether it's using the tool or your fingers you do have some risk of scarring. so every pimple blackhead whitehead or a pustule or papule all starts out as a same thing. our face is covered with lots of little hair follicles which are called pores. at the base of those follicles there can be some bacteria that grows as well called p. acnes. for some reason which we don't fully understand why that is the opening of the follicle can become blocked and that means that all the contents behind it has no place to go it can't get to the surface. so as it builds up it can create a little bump on the surface and it can look a little bit white that's a whitehead. if it opens to the surface it gets oxidized and that's a blackhead. so a blackhead isn't dark because it's dirty it's dark because there is oxidation that goes on and makes it look dark. if there is a p. acnes bacteria that's growing at the base of that follicle now that the follicle is closed this kind of bacteria loves an environment where there is no oxygen. so once the covering gets closed there is no more oxygen the bacteria wakes up and it has all this great food; its got the oils from the oil glands that are produced there and all the proteins from the skin cells that are clogged behind it. and now its got an abundance of food supplies so it starts to flourish and that can look like a pimple. so when you pick at it what you do is you create an inflammatory response which makes it red and angry and can make it more likely to persist or last longer and more likely to scar and more likely to come back in the same spot so picking is very bad. but your dermatologist can help extract that for you or give you a treatment like a retinoid or a topical antibiotic that can get rid of that pimple for you much more quickly and safely.,do they really work to remove blackheads and how do they work?,['acne'],wmd

cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder. specifically cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease. this means that to get the disease you must inherit the changed (mutated) gene from both parents. keep in mind: if a person inherits the changed gene from only one parent he or she will not develop cystic fibrosis but will be a carrier of the disease. carriers may pass the cystic fibrosis gene defect onto their children. if you are planning a pregnancy and you are white talk to your doctor about having a genetic test to determine your chances of having a child with cystic fibrosis. the disease is much more common in white people than in people of other races. the way that you eat how much you exercise whether you smoke or the kind of environment you live in does not cause cystic fibrosis. but if you have cystic fibrosis changes in your environment (such as not being around smokers) or changes in your behavior (such as eating the right kinds of foods) can help you feel better and live longer. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,what increases the risk of getting cystic fibrosis?,['cystic fibrosis'],wmd

""it's in the blood"" is what i have grown up hearing about poison oak once you have gotten it on you. always thought that statement was crazy until  years ago i accidently got it on me. the rash has come up every year without fail in the same exact spot even when i have avoided the outdoors pets and all clothing and bedding washed repeatedly. tried just about every home grown or over the counter cure possible. usually just have to keep the area clean and wait it out. the most horrid plant in the universe! i have had symptoms of poison ivy rash which was initially on undersides of arms and on front of shins. now over most of my body. after two  day treatments of  steroids a day and steroid cream it is worse than ever (during steroid treatments it started to fade but came back with a vengence when the pills stopped). desperate now with itching awful looking skin. have left the gym (which had helped me lose  stone in  months). hate going as whether you are working out or swimming people quite naturally look at your skin. i am now to see a dermatologist on tuesday so can only hope something can be improved. best cooling lotions i have used for relief of itching have been aloe vera and (one i got in the us) called caladryl clear (topical analgesic skin protectant). coated in this after cold water or ice to skin seems to make me more comfortable. i got this in june and it is now nearly september. worst thing i have ever managed to get. deeply regret doing all that gardening now and still haven't found the pouson ivy.",can poison ivy rash return same place after  months? . rash returned same places on arms after  months since had first rash. . haven't been any where near any plants no pets to come in contact with poison ivy. any one ever hear of this happening?,"['arm', 'rash', 'plant', 'poison ivy', 'pets']",wmd

the types of arrhythmias include: premature atrial contractions. these are early extra beats that originate in the atria (upper chambers of the heart). they are harmless and generally do not require treatment. premature ventricular contractions (pvcs). these are among the most common arrhythmias and occur in people with or without heart disease. this is the skipped heartbeat we all occasionally experience. in some people it can be related to stress too much caffeine or nicotine or too much exercise. but sometimes pvcs can be caused by heart disease or electrolyte imbalance. people who have a lot of pvcs and/or symptoms associated with them should be evaluated by a heart doctor. however in most people pvcs are usually harmless and rarely need treatment. atrial fibrillation. atrial fibrillation is a very common irregular heart rhythm that causes the atria the upper chambers of the heart to contract abnormally. atrial flutter. this is an arrhythmia caused by one or more rapid circuits in the atrium. atrial flutter is usually more organized and regular than atrial fibrillation. this arrhythmia occurs most often in people with heart disease and in the first week after heart surgery. it often converts to atrial fibrillation. paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (psvt). a rapid heart rate usually with a regular rhythm originating from above the ventricles. psvt begins and ends suddenly. there are two main types: accessory path tachycardias and av nodal reentrant tachycardias (see below). accessory pathway tachycardias. a rapid heart rate due to an extra abnormal pathway or connection between the atria and the ventricles. the impulses travel through the extra pathways as well as through the usual route. this allows the impulses to travel around the heart very quickly causing the heart to beat unusually fast. av nodal reentrant tachycardia. a rapid heart rate due to more than one pathway through the av node. it can cause heart palpitations fainting or heart failure. in some cases it can be terminated using simple maneuvers such as breathing in and bearing down. some drugs can also stop this heart rhythm. ventricular tachycardia (v-tach). a rapid heart rhythm originating from the lower chambers (or ventricles) of the heart. the rapid rate prevents the heart from filling adequately with blood. this can be a serious arrhythmia especially in people with heart disease and may be associated with more symptoms. ventricular fibrillation. an erratic disorganized firing of impulses from the ventricles. the ventricles quiver and are unable to contract or pump blood to the body. this is a medical emergency that must be treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr) and defibrillation as soon as possible. long qt syndrome. the qt interval is the area on the electrocardiogram that represents the time it takes for the heart muscle to contract and then recover or for the electrical impulse to fire impulses and then recharge. when the qt interval is longer than normal it increases the risk of a life-threatening form of ventricular tachycardia. long qt syndrome is an inherited condition that can cause sudden death in young people. it can be treated with antiarrhythmic drugs pacemaker electrical cardioversion defibrillation implanted cardioverter/defibrillator or ablation therapy. bradyarrhythmias. these are slow heart rhythms which may arise from disease in the heart's electrical conduction system. examples include sinus node dysfunction and heart block. sinus node dysfunction. a slow heart rhythm due to an abnormal sinus node. significant sinus node dysfunction that causes symptoms is treated with a pacemaker. heart block. a delay or complete block of the electrical impulse as it travels from the sinus node to the ventricles. the heart may beat irregularly and often more slowly. if serious heart block is treated with a pacemaker.,what are the types of arrhythmias?,['arrhythmia'],wmd

"drug metabolism is the process by which the body breaks down medications. the liver plays a major role in metabolism especially a group of enzymes known as cytochrome p-. drug interactions can occur when two or more drugs inhibit or induce a p- reaction and the drugs do not metabolize as quickly as they should. nicotine is a ""drug"" also and is known to induce the p- system. individuals with liver disease may also have insufficient levels of p- enzymes. the result is that drug levels can remain high in the bloodstream and cause more side effects. genetic factors also play a role in drug metabolism. the metabolic rate can vary significantly from person to person and drug dosages that work quickly and effectively in one individual may not work well for another or cause build-up and more side effects. infants and elderly patients have a reduced abilty to metabolize certain drugs so we often adjust their med dosage. but we find that people with fm  seem to act like ""geriatric patients"" in terms of sensitivity to meds and side effects (and metabolism? ) and often require lower doses than the ""normal"" non-fm adult. certain foods such as grapefruit juice and certain meds taken on an occasional basis can inactivate or lessen the metabolic activity of p- and can cause apparent fluctuations in response/tolerence to regular prescribed meds. we with fibro always seem to develop tolerances and intolerances to meds that we previously did well with which is frustrating to say the least. so there are different metabolism tolerance and intolerance factors that can cause us to have ""reactions"" to our meds. .",what affects drug metabolization from dose to dose?,['drug'],wmd

this is a great question and i'm glad you asked it. not all medications are effective if dissolved in a liquid. i'd suggest you check with the child's doctor or pharmacist to learn if this technique is appropriate with the medication in question. meanwhile i'd recommend dissolving the medication in the smallest amount of liquid possible and having the child drink it all at once. for example if you could dissolve the medication in an ounce or two of cola you could reward her with the remainder of the can after she drinks the portion containing the medicine. dissolving the medication in a small amount of fluid will create a higher concentration of it in the mixture so that when she takes it she'll get something close to the full dose. i hope this helps!,if you disolved medication in diet coke do you have to ingest it in a certain amount of time for it to be effective? . i overlook the care of a child with a seizure disorder she does not like to take her medication so we dissolve it in diet coke the question has been asked if this affects the effectiveness of the medication.,"['diet', 'seizure disorder']",wmd

ouch! having both elbows injured at the same time can't be fun! the bottom line is this: if you're concerned about your elbow not feeling better after  weeks then there's nothing wrong with going back to the doctor and having it re-examined. if nothing else it will give you peace of mind. it's possible the elbow that wasn't x-rayed sustained a soft tissue injury. these can be very painful and slow to heal. it sounds like you have full range of motion with that elbow which is good. in other words you can bend it fully. that's always a good sign. still when in doubt check it out. you can start with your primary care provider. he or she will take an x-ray if needed and hopefully get you on the path to being pain-free. good luck!,injured elbows  wks ago. one xrayed & stitches. both still tender & one not xrayed hurts most. tiny bones protruding mo. both elbows are still sore and the one not xrayed or examined most hurts most. the tiny bone on top and bottom that are visible when bending arm across in front of myself stick out more than my other elbow. should i be concerned after  weeks and/or have that elbow looked at again?,[],wmd

the main concern with prolonged ht is an increased risk of breast cancer. the risk seems to be greater in women taking combined therapy (estrogen plus a progestogen) than in women taking estrogen alone. and it may be that starting ht right away after menopause is also associated with greater risk. the good news is that the risk returns to baseline within several years after stopping ht. you should also be aware that combined ht can make it more difficult to read your mammogram (both while you're taking hormones and in the first years after stopping). as a result you might be called back for additional views or biopsy of suspicious areas. right now most experts recommend limiting ht to several years. the nams  ht position statement ( www. menopause. org/. pdf ) suggests that longer use is acceptable for a woman if she believes that the benefits outweigh the risks (especially if she's had trouble stopping therapy). the other condition includes women with low bone mass or osteoporosis who cannot tolerate osteoporosis drugs. the one exception to limiting ht to a few years is the woman who has had premature menopause either because of natural failure of her ovaries or surgical removal. in that case most experts are comfortable advising you to continue ht at least until the age of natural menopause about age  at which time you can reassess. if you've been taking hormones for a very long time you might want to start by discussing a lower dose. many clinicians now prescribe half the dose we used to use.,what are the risks of long term use of hormone replacement therapy?,['hormone replacement therapy'],wmd

parkinson's disease belongs to a group of conditions called movement disorders. the four main symptoms are: tremor or trembling in hands arms legs jaw or head. rigidity or stiffness of the limbs and trunk. bradykinesia or slowness of movement. postural instability or impaired balance. these symptoms usually begin gradually and worsen with time. as they become more pronounced patients may have difficulty walking talking or completing other simple tasks. not everyone with one or more of these symptoms has parkinson's disease as the symptoms sometimes appear in other diseases as well. parkinson's disease is both chronic meaning it persists over a long period of time and progressive meaning its symptoms grow worse over time. it is not contagious. although some parkinson's disease cases appear to be hereditary and a few can be traced to specific genetic mutations most cases are sporadic -- that is the disease does not seem to run in families. many researchers now believe that parkinson's disease results from a combination of genetic susceptibility and exposure to one or more environmental factors that trigger the disease. parkinson's disease is the most common form of parkinsonism the name for a group of disorders with similar features and symptoms. parkinson's disease is also called primary parkinsonism or idiopathic parkinson's disease. the term idiopathic means a disorder for which no cause has yet been found. while most forms of parkinsonism are idiopathic there are some cases where the cause is known or suspected or where the symptoms result from another disorder. for example parkinsonism may result from changes in the brain's blood vessels.,what is parkinson's disease?,"[""parkinson's disease""]",wmd

if pregnancy is the concern then the best way to find out is to get a blood serum beta hcg test done. this is a confirmatory test for pregnancy as the urine pregnancy kits may show false positive results. if the levels of hcg are more than  or raised then pregnancy is confirmed. if the level is less than  then pregnancy is completely ruled out. if the test is positive then you should undergo an ultrasound pelvis to locate the pregnancy for its site which could be intrauterine or possibly in the tubes (ectopic). if the usg shows extrauterine pregnancy then you would require a laparoscopic salpingectomy to remove the damaged tube along with the ectopic. if the pregnancy is intrauterine then you may decide upon continuing the pregnancy. if the test is negative then the possible cause remains uti (urinary tract infection) or a possible pid (pelvic inflammatory disease) or endometriosis. also stress per se can cause derangement of hormonal balance and can cause heavy bleeding inspite of being on continuous progesterone pills. this can be controlled with antifibrinolytics in the absence of pregnancy. for further follow up consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online --> <link>,i have heavy bleeding and spotting at times. is there a possibility that i might have ectopic pregnancy?,['heavy bleeding'],ic

burns are classified based upon their depth. a first degree burn is superficial and causes local inflammation of the skin. sunburns often are categorized as first degree burns. the inflammation is characterized by pain redness and a mild amount of swelling. the skin may be very tender to touch. second degree burns are deeper and in addition to the pain redness and inflammation there is also blistering of the skin. third degree burns are deeper still involving all layers of the skin in effect killing that area of skin. because the nerves and blood vessels are damaged third degree burns appear white and leathery and tend to be relatively painless. burns are not static and may mature. over a few hours a first degree burn may involve deeper structures and become second degree. think of a sunburn that blisters the next day. similarly second degree burns may evolve into third degree burns. regardless of the type of burn inflammation and fluid accumulation in and around the wound occur. moreover it should be noted that the skin is the body's first defense against infection by microorganisms. a burn is also a break in the skin and the risk of infection exists both at the site of the injury and potentially throughout the body. only the epidermis has the ability to regenerate itself. burns that extend deeper may cause permanent injury and scarring and not allow the skin in that area to return to normal function.,how are burns classified?,['burn'],wmd

the various medicines used to treat osteoporosis work in different ways. the various medicines used to treat osteoporosis work in different ways. bisphosphonates including drugs like actonel boniva fosamax and reclast work by blocking the effects of certain bone-destroying cells. in this way bisphosphonates can slow down bone loss and lower your risk of fracture. evista is a different sort of medicine called a selective estrogen receptor modulator or serm. it works by mimicking some of the effects of the hormone estrogen which has a beneficial effect on bone mass. other treatments are available. bone is constantly remodeling -- old bone is removed by cells called osteoclasts and new bone is laid down by cells called osteoblasts. calcitonin a hormone made within the thyroid gland inhibits bone removal by osteoclasts and promotes bone formation by osteoblasts. forteo a synthetic hormone may also help build bone mass by enhancing the actions of osteoblasts. prolia stops the bone-removing cells before they cause bone loss and is used to treat postmenopausal woman with osteoporosis.,how do the main osteoporosis medications differ?,"['osteoporosis', 'drug']",wmd

"you can expect on average to lose % to % of your body fat per month but the range of loss varies widely between individuals because there are so many variables that affect body composition including age gender amount of body fat and muscle mass that you start with and a myriad of hormones that control how efficient your body is at storing fat and metabolizing it. unlike body weight where no more than two pounds per week of loss is recommended there are no standards or guidelines for how quickly to lose body fat or gain muscle because there hasn't been enough research to determine a healthy body fat percentage. you should also know that when you lose weight as much as % of the lost weight could be muscle. that is you could lose  pounds of muscle if you lose  pounds. the principle problem in terms of weight loss with losing so much muscle is that muscle is the metabolically active ""organ"" in your body that burns most of the calories and so losing it could slow down your weight- and fat-loss efforts. in fact losing muscle is one of the factors involved in weight-loss plateaus. the good news is that studies show that aerobic and resistance exercise can prevent muscle loss by as much as % and % respectively if you do it consistently three or more times per week. measuring body composition during weight loss is objective data that could prove as important as measuring weight. a bioelectric impedance (bia) scale can help you do that. bia scales estimate body fat by sending a very weak (and safe) electrical signal through your body and then measuring the resistance to the signal created by your body fat. fat is a poor conductor of electricity and so the more fat you have the more resistance there is. there is a % to % error possible with bia that depends on your hydration status time of last meal last round of exercise amount of alcohol in your system and some medications (for example diuretics). the error can be even higher than % so be sure to follow the manufacturer's guidelines to obtain the most reliable estimate. you can find bia scales online.",how rapidly should one's body fat composition change with diet and exercise?,"['exercise', 'diet']",wmd

please do not take tylenol ( acetaminophen ) with vicodin (hydrocodone-apap) because vicodin contains tylenol already. it is very easy to exceed the maximum daily limit of acetaminophen by combining these two drugs. and high doses of acetaminophen may lead to liver damage. if the hydrocodone isn't controlling your pain i'd suggest you speak with your health care provider. from a pharmacology standpoint there's no harm in combining ibuprofen with hydrocodone but ibuprofen is a blood thinner. so if you're taking hydrocodone to control post-surgical pain for example your doctor may not want you taking a blood thinner like ibuprofen. also your health care provider may not want you taking ibuprofen based on other medications you currently take your past medical history and many other factors. so in a nutshell i'd suggest you simply put a call in to your provider for guidance on what medications are safe for you to take for pain control. wishing you all the best! vicodin which is a combination of acetaminophen (the active ingredient in tylenol) and hydrocodone. long-term effects on the body from products that contain acetaminophen can lead to severe liver damage and liver failure. gallus detox center is a private inpatient medical detox facility that specializes in iv therapy medical detox. if you have questions about our facility or detox method please call us at --.,is it safe to take ibuprofen with vicodin? or is tylenol safer?,['ibuprofen'],wmd

this is an excellent question! i can understand why this distinction could be confusing to some people because both stroke and a subdural hematoma involve bleeding inside the skull. however the two conditions are very different. in the simplest terms stroke involves bleeding inside the brain; a subdural hematoma involves bleeding outside the brain. when a stroke occurs a blood vessel within the brain tissue either ruptures or becomes blocked. this in turn deprives an area of brain tissue from receiving the oxygen-rich blood it needs to survive. stroke can occur without warning and often includes one or more of these symptoms : one-sided body weakness numbness or loss of function slurred speech trouble finding the right words sudden vision changes sudden balance changes severe headache a subdural hematoma on the other hand occurs in the tissues that surround the brain. many people don't realize the brain is wrapped in several layers of tissue for protection. first comes the scalp; then the bone tissue of the skull; then a tough fibrous layer of tissue called the 'dura mater;' then a webby layer called 'arachnoid' tissue; and lastly a delicate tissue-paper like layer called the 'pia mater. ' the brain itself lies below all of these layers of tissue. a subdural hematoma is a blood clot that forms due to a bleed that occurs below the dura mater and above the arachnoid tissue. a bleed can occur here due to trauma such as a concussion or other head injury. a subdural hematoma can cause pressure inside the skull to rise compressing delicate brain tissue and causing cells to die. it is a medical emergency that requires a procedure called a craniotomy to remove the blood clot and relieve swelling and pressure inside the skull. keep in mind i have greatly simplified the anatomy in this description. but i hope it helps you better understand how a stroke is different from a subdural hematoma!,what is the difference between a stroke and a subdural hematoma?,"['stroke', 'subdural hematoma']",wmd
you probably  know much about mini warts (or technically speaking molluscum contagiosum). every summer parents bring their kids in with curious little rashes that just dont seem to go away. they are tiny firm raised flesh-colored bumps that often show up in the armpit the back of the knees the trunk the forearm or the inner thigh. (the only place they dont show up are the palms and soles. ) so what are they? a virus. yes these tiny warts are caused by a virus. and yes that means they are contagious. they spread from person-to-person by direct contact with the spots. and kids can spread them around their own bodies by scratching and picking at them. the spots are kind of itchy but they are really more of a nuisance than a serious health issue. kids with eczema tend to have more problems because the itchy spots lead to scratching which leads to eczema flare-ups. if left alone the molluscum eventually goes away. but eventually can mean  months or  years. molluscum isnt just a summer virus but i do see more kids with it after spending their summer in the swimming pool. studies looking at the ability of the virus to spread in a chlorinated pool have been inconclusive thus far. thus there are no regulations restricting kids from public swimming pools when theyve got those spots. (besides the fact that one in  kids would have to stay out of a pool if there was a rule thats how common molluscum is! ) the molluscum virus also seems to spread through non-chlorinated water (like your bathtub). if one of your kids has molluscum do not let him share a bath or a drying off towel with your other kids. about % of kids with molluscum will spread it to their sibling. if you want to get rid of the molluscum before they decide to go away on their own i suggest speaking to your childs doctor or consulting a dermatologist. there are a variety of methods none of which is % successful or pain-free. so you should consider the options before proceeding.,what are mini-warts?,['wart'],wmd

i don't have an answer for your specific question but i can give you some general information about staph infections. staph infections are caused by staphylococcus bacteria. these bacteria often reside on the skin or inside the nose or mouth of otherwise healthy people. usually these bacteria cause no problems. when the skin is broken however these germs can get into the tissue and cause an infection. any break in the skin such as a scratch presents an opportunity for staph to invade. many staph infections remain confined to the skin. these usually can be treated easily with oral antibiotics. in more severe cases staph bacteria can get into the bloodstream and cause serious symptoms. these cases usually require hospitalization and treatment with intravenous antibiotics. if you experienced a staph infection after undergoing a procedure you should ask your doctor if the two things are related. i am not familiar with the risks involved with sclerotherapy. it is quite possible staph infection is a known risk of that procedure although doctors and support staff take every precaution to disinfect the skin prior to cutting or penetrating it in any way. your question brings up a great topic which is always ask about infection risks prior to any medical procedure no matter how minor. these days infection is always a risk when you undergo a procedure that punctures the skin. it is wise to understand all the risks before a procedure so you can weight them against the potential benefits. wishing you well!,"is it possible to experience a staph infection  days post vein injection for ""spider"" veins?

every exercise session should include a warm-up conditioning phase and a cool-down. warm-up. this helps your body adjust slowly from rest to exercise. a warm-up reduces the stress on your heart and muscles slowly increases your breathing circulation (heart rate) and body temperature. it also helps improve flexibility and reduce muscle soreness. the best warm-up includes stretching range of motion activities and the beginning of the activity at a low intensity level. conditioning. this follows the warm-up. during the conditioning phase the benefits of exercise are gained and calories are burned. be sure to monitor the intensity of the activity (check your heart rate). don't over do it. cool-down. this is the last phase of your exercise session. it allows your body to gradually recover from the conditioning phase. your heart rate and blood pressure will return to near resting values. cool-down does not mean to sit down! in fact do not sit stand still or lie down right after exercise. this may cause you to feel dizzy or lightheaded or have heart palpitations (fluttering in your chest). the best cool-down is to slowly decrease the intensity of your activity. you may also do some of the same stretching activities you did in the warm-up phase.,what should i include in an exercise program?,['exercise'],wmd

most helpful answer thanks for providing all the great background information! if several different doctors have told you the blemish is a cyst then that's probably accurate. a cyst is a pocket of tissue that's filled with some type of fluid. the type of fluid can vary depending on the type of cyst. some are filled with fatty acids while others contain pus. it sounds like your cyst is located within the skin layer not in the breast tissue which is good news. skin cysts are very common and do tend to drain occasionally as you've described. the fact the cyst has gotten bigger and changed color is a good reason to have a health care provider re-evaluate this. it's possible the cyst needs to be treated by having it drained or even removed. only your health care provider can say for sure. cysts are an annoyance but luckily they're not a serious disease. good luck to you as you cope with this!,"how do you know if a lump on your breast that emits white liquid like a zit occasionaly is serious or not? . i've had it for about  years im  now in the same place with  different doctors looking at it all saying that it was nothing to worry about and just ""normal"". one doctor said it was a cyst caused from my bra and that i needed new bra's. it sometimes emited pus like a zit does usually in larger amount. though recently it has gotten slightly bigger and has a faint purpleish coloring to it like a bruise instead of my normal skin color like before should i go see a doctor again?","['cyst', 'bruise', 'breast', 'skin', 'lump']",wmd

autism is a medical condition in which there are problems with communication and social interaction. this is a rather serious condition to be diagnosed without a complex and complete examination. the child might lack eye contact as you mentioned. the babbling in these children might be accompanied with unusual gestures repeating othersâ words whereas the words are less frequently associated with appropriate gestures. repetitive behaviour might be one of the symptoms that are most easy to recognize. it might include: compulsive behaviour ritualistic behaviour stereotypy or even self-injury. as for the slow improvement of the speech please consider that many children just need more time to talk and to be understood. different conditions might be causing this situation. sometimes the child might need help from a specialist for speech and language therapy whom you are advised to visit. s/he might be able to detect if there are any physiological problems with the speech-related organs (the tongue the palate the throat) or the child simply needs more time to develop the speech. to exclude autism you might want to take your child to a neuropsychologist pediatrician. until than please keep in mind that there are many children at the age of  months whose speech is not fluent enough to be understood clearly.,my son is now nineteen months old and doesnt say any words at all. he jabbers a lot but you can't understand any of it. he seems very normal otherwise. he plays and laughs and smiles. i've read things about how autistic children don't hold eye contact. he can and does. we have a seven year old son as well and i don't remember it taking this long for him to talk. should i be concerned that he may be autistic? i'm a nervous wreck over this.,"['symptoms', 'autism', 'autism symptoms of', 'pediatrician', 'autistic children symptoms', 'autism symptoms children', 'autism and language', 'autism communication', 'behaviour children', 'behaviour problems', 'autism']",eh

epilepsy is a brain disorder in which clusters of nerve cells or neurons in the brain sometimes signal abnormally. neurons normally generate electrochemical impulses that act on other neurons glands and muscles to produce human thoughts feelings and actions. in epilepsy the normal pattern of neuronal activity becomes disturbed causing strange sensations emotions and behavior or sometimes convulsions muscle spasms and loss of consciousness. during a seizure neurons may fire as many as  times a second much faster than normal. in some people this happens only occasionally; for others it may happen up to hundreds of times a day. more than  million people in the united states -- about  in  -- have experienced an unprovoked seizure or been diagnosed with epilepsy. for about  percent of those diagnosed with epilepsy seizures can be controlled with modern medicines and surgical techniques. however about  to  percent of people with epilepsy will continue to experience seizures even with the best available treatment. doctors call this situation intractable epilepsy. having a seizure does not necessarily mean that a person has epilepsy. only when a person has had two or more seizures is he or she considered to have epilepsy. epilepsy is not contagious and is not caused by mental illness or mental retardation. some people with mental retardation may experience seizures but seizures do not necessarily mean the person has or will develop mental impairment. many people with epilepsy have normal or above-average intelligence. famous people who are known or rumored to have had epilepsy include the russian writer dostoyevsky the philosopher socrates the military general napoleon and the inventor of dynamite alfred nobel who established the nobel prize. several olympic medalists and other athletes also have had epilepsy. seizures sometimes do cause brain damage particularly if they are severe. however most seizures do not seem to have a detrimental effect on the brain. any changes that do occur are usually subtle and it is often unclear whether these changes are caused by the seizures themselves or by the underlying problem that caused the seizures. while epilepsy cannot currently be cured for some people it does eventually go away. one study found that children with idiopathic epilepsy or epilepsy with an unknown cause had a  to  percent chance of becoming seizure-free by  years after their diagnosis. the odds of becoming seizure-free are not as good for adults or for children with severe epilepsy syndromes but it is nonetheless possible that seizures may decrease or even stop over time. this is more likely if the epilepsy has been well-controlled by medication or if the person has had epilepsy surgery.,what is epilepsy?,['epilepsy'],wmd

hepatitis b is spread mainly by exposure to infected blood or body secretions. in infected individuals the virus can be found in the blood semen vaginal discharge breast milk and saliva. hepatitis b is not spread through food water or by casual contact. in the united states sexual contact is the most common means of transmission followed by using contaminated needles for injecting illicit drugs tattooing body piercing or acupuncture. additionally hepatitis b can be transmitted through sharing toothbrushes and razors contaminated with infected fluids or blood. hepatitis b also may be spread from infected mothers to their babies at birth (so-called 'vertical' transmission). this is the most prevalent means of transmission in regions of the world where hepatitis b rates are high. the rate of transmission of hepatitis b from mother to newborn is very high and almost all infected infants will develop chronic hepatitis b. fortunately transmission can be significantly reduced through immunoprophylaxis. rarely hepatitis b can be transmitted through transfused blood products donated livers and other organs. however blood and organ donors are routinely screened for hepatitis which typically prevents this type of transmission.,how is the hepatitis b virus spread (transmitted)?,"['hepatitis b', 'virus']",wmd

i see this everyday in my practice and it's a real problem. this is a condition that's most likely called melasma. we used to only see it in pregnant women but what happens now is that when women take the pill and the longer they take the pill; so it's almost any contraceptive whether it's a patch or a pill that contains hormones the longer you are on that and then when you combine that with even minimal sun exposure can cause a patchy discoloration usually symmetric on the cheeks or upper lip and even on the forehead. this gets darker in the summer often fades in the winter but on the upper lip especially can look like a mustache and women just hate this. so it's important to understand the underlying cause it's hormones and sun exposure either from being on the pill or just your own natural hormones or during pregnancy. then the other part is the sun that you really have to protect against. when i say protect i don't mean if you are going to the beach. if you are just going to walk on the street get your newspaper from the corner go to the bus stop you have to have adequate protection on. wear a hat if you can try to stay in the shade when you can. this condition can be treated but it can often be difficult to treat. what we use are things like hydroquinones or ingredients that have sepiwhite or mulberry root extract or liquorice extract those are ingredients you can look for on products and as dermatologists we can also do treatments in the office. there are certain chemical peels that we can do that can help target that pigment in a very specific way and help lighten it. but if you go in the sun it will come right back.,i have pigmentation on my upper lip. i am taking birth control pills. help! i look like i have a mustache.,"['lip', 'birth control pill']",wmd

in the early stages crohn's disease causes small scattered shallow crater-like areas (erosions) on the inner surface of the bowel. these erosions are called aphthous ulcers. with time the erosions become deeper and larger ultimately becoming true ulcers (which are deeper than erosions) and causing scarring and stiffness of the bowel. as the disease progresses the bowel becomes increasingly narrowed and ultimately can become obstructed. deep ulcers can puncture holes in the wall of the bowel and bacteria from within the bowel can spread to infect adjacent organs and the surrounding abdominal cavity. when crohn's disease narrows the small intestine to the point of obstruction the flow of the contents through the intestine ceases. sometimes the obstruction can be caused suddenly by poorly digestible fruit or vegetables that plug the already narrowed segment of the intestine. when the intestine is obstructed digesting food fluid and gas from the stomach and the small intestine cannot pass into the colon. the symptoms of small intestinal obstruction then appear including severe abdominal cramps nausea vomiting and abdominal distention. obstruction of the small intestine is much more likely since the small intestine is much narrower than the colon to begin with. deep ulcers can puncture holes in the walls of the small intestine and the colon and create a tunnel between the intestine and adjacent organs. if the ulcer tunnel reaches an adjacent empty space inside the abdominal cavity a collection of infected pus (an abdominal abscess) is formed. patients with abdominal abscesses can develop tender abdominal masses high fevers and abdominal pain. when the ulcer tunnels into an adjacent organ a channel (fistula) is formed. the formation of a fistula between the intestine and the bladder (enteric-vesicular fistula) can cause frequent urinary tract infections and the passage of gas and feces during urination. when a fistula develops between the intestine and the skin (enteric-cutaneous fistula) pus and mucous emerge from a small painful opening on the skin of the abdomen. the development of a fistula between the colon and the vagina (colonic-vaginal fistula) causes gas and feces to emerge through the vagina. the presence of a fistula from the intestines to the anus (anal fistula) leads to a discharge of mucous and pus from the fistula's opening around the anus.,how does crohn's disease affect the intestines?,"['intestine', ""crohn's disease""]",wmd

the question of whether or not it is wise to have cosmetic surgery while pregnant comes up most often when a patient who is scheduled for surgery finds out that she is pregnant. she then calls us and asks for our advice. nearly all the procedures that we do in elective cosmetic facial surgery are done under anesthesia; it is never wise to have a procedure while pregnant. that is why we do a pregnancy test just prior to the surgery. the chances of aborting the fetus are extremely high if one has a general anesthetic in the first three months of pregnancy. in any event even if one were beyond the first three months it just doesnt make much sense because the body during pregnancy has changed with respect to circulating levels of hormones. there are blood count issues and a variety of reasons why it makes absolutely no sense to have an elective procedure during pregnancy. even if an operation could be done under local anesthesia i would never undertake such an operation because the local anesthetic itself gets into the blood stream and could possibly enter the fetal circulation. bottom line why ever take a chance?,is it safe to have cosmetic surgery when you are pregnant?,"['pregnancy', 'cosmetic surgery']",wmd

it's highly unlikely that botulinum toxin (botox is one common brand) could cause a transient ischemic attack (tia). you don't say why you had injections of botulinum toxin (while people associate botox with cosmetic treatments in truth there are many therapeutic uses for the medication) but it's likely the tias were coincidental to your botulinum toxin injections. tias occur when blood flow to an area of the brain is temporarily blocked (usually by a blood clot) in one of the arteries of the brain. botulinum toxin is a muscle relaxant drug. it isn't injected into the blood stream and has no relationship to clot formation. botulinum toxin is injected into muscles for various reasons -- to smooth wrinkles around the eyes (cosmetic) or to help reduce spasms of the pectoral muscle in breast reconstruction after mastectomy (therapeutic) to name just two examples. if you have any concerns about whether or not botulinum toxin could have been involved in your tia you should talk to the healthcare provider who performed the botox injections. wishing you well!,can botox cause a tia. i've had two episodes of tia and each time i'd had botox injections. i also have two brain aneurysms. the only other factor i have for tia i'd high chlorestorol and it is under control with meds. these episodes were three years apart.,['brain aneurysm'],wmd

there is no disputing the importance of proper nutrition during pregnancy. there is some dispute about the safety of caffeine during this time. one concern is that caffeine may lead to miscarriages. in a study following  pregnant women no relationship between caffeine consumption up to  mg/day and adverse pregnancy outcomes was found. another study examined the relationship between caffeine consumption and spontaneous abortions in over   women and found no association. a recent study found that caffeine can reach the follicular fluid of the ovaries. it also found that an increase in coffee consumption was associated with an increased number of aborted pregnancies. on the other side research has also shown no clear relationship between caffeine intake and fertility and birth defects. even with this evidence everyone agrees that there is a limit for how much caffeine can be consumed during pregnancy. the majority of the subjects in the studies were consuming small to moderate amounts of caffeine. it is difficult to accurately test the effects of very high intakes of caffeine without risking the health of the mother and child. the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists recommends a caffeine limit of the equivalent of one to two cups of coffee per day during pregnancy.,is caffeine safe during pregnancy?,"['pregnancy', 'caffeine']",wmd

hi just done a bit more searching whats below come from this site www. urologyhealth. org can a change in diet or herbal remedies prevent or cure a yeast infection? scientists do not know why fungal infections develop in some individuals and not others. they also are not sure just how diet might impact the problem or herbal remedies help it. but they do know that diabetic patients have an increased vulnerability to these infections leading them to suggest that anyone diagnosed with diabetes should avoid high carbohydrate diets. yogurt may provide normal microorganisms for the genitourinary tract so many advocate it as a preventative measure or treatment of yeast infections. a few of things i forgot keep out of jeans and slacks same with tights wear just lose cotton knickers go without when you can and shave off your pubic hair this last bit is because yi dose love a nice warm moist area to live in so without any hair you could shut the door to them. and this last bit is from www. yeastinfection. org . those suffering a long time: if youre in the third group youve been suffering for a very long time ten years or more. it feels like youve tried everything under the sun and youve probably spent hundreds maybe even thousands of dollars on products that just dont work. youve lost a ton of money and sadly a huge chunk of your life. ive seen many patients like this over the years and have built my reputation on turning many of these cases around. its what gets me up in the morning and makes me feel excited to be able to give people the opportunity to achieve amazing results at their own hands with the right information and encouragement. if you are in the group of people who hasnt had a diagnosis you probably think im making this up; or at least fluffing up the details a bit. the truth though is that ive spent the past  years of my career as a naturopathic physician talking to thousands of people who feel like their lives have been ruined. these are just a few of the stories ive heard. i wasnt kidding when i said ive heard countless stories just like this – from men and women alike. when a candida overgrowth gets to the point where its wreaking havoc with your entire body you may ultimately become so ill and beat that you just cant seem to function. its difficult to work because you constantly feel fuzzy headed anxious and depressed sick to your stomach and sensitive to just about any food chemical or toxin you come into contact with. its not just adults who are too sick to build their careers further their educations or have fun with family and friends either. a number of the parents ive worked with have brought their children to see me. in some cases i can trace the path of candida in children all the way back to birth. during the birthing process when a baby should be getting nutrients and good bacterial flora from his mother these children contracted yeast instead. instead of growing stronger they remained compromised as their condition worsened with age. and when they became unwell what would the doctor prescribe? you guessed it more antibiotics. these may help as well. good luck,intercourse and all of my past and current partners always complain of a vaginal infection/yest infection. for the past - years it seems every time i have intercourse with my partner i seem to give them or they seem to get a vaginal infection. the only time it they dont seem to get any type of infection is when we use condoms or if we spend  mins cleaning myself down there and then using rubbing alcohol on it before intercourse. . i have been tested multiple times and they cant find anything wrong with me. they have been tested multiple times also and the only thing they can find is a yeast infecti,"['vagina', 'condom', 'yeast']",wmd

it sounds like your friend is bothered by the persistent tingling and numbness in his left foot. i understand these sensations can be quite irritating especially if your work involves standing for long periods. did he have these tingling sensations in the same areas before the surgery? if so have these worsened after the surgery or remained the same? i assume his symptoms before the surgery were also on the left side and his hemilaminectomy was also performed on the left side. it will be nice if i could see the preoperative mri images to see what the hemilaminectomy was done for. often if the surgery involves removal of a large herniated disc or the space available for the nerve is very less (stenosis) then the nerve may get bruised during surgery due to retraction. this means that in order to decompress the nerve the surgeon has to retract the nerve to go around the nerve and remove the compressing elements. if the compression is severe the nerve gets bruised easily and there may be persistent numbness and tingling in the areas of the leg and foot that are geographically supplied by that nerve. since the surgeon has advised him to wait it out i assume this is likely the case. swelling of the foot is common if the nerve supplying that area is not fully functional. the weak muscles in the leg and foot are not able to push the blood back up towards the heart and gravity causes this dependent area to swell up. this is often seen at the end of the day and gets better at night when he sleeps. it is difficult to predict how long the tingling will last. it could be a few months. the fact that there is tingling and not pure numbness is actually encouraging although it is more irritating to the patient. if it were a complete nerve injury then only numbness would be experienced. the presence of tingling means that the nerve is just irritated inflamed and swollen due to the bruising. if the tingling is very bothersome he may try some neuralgic pain medications like gabapentin or pregabalin. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (nsaids) may also help in this situation. there is a very rare possibility of other complications like recurrent disc herniation other post-surgical changes irritating the nerve etc. these are difficult to diagnose and usually need a new mri with contrast. however it is advisable to delay such investigation for at least for two to three months after surgery since the mri images at this stage will be obscured by the post surgical changes. if the symptoms of tingling and numbness are progressively worsening and if he develops back pain a new mri may be needed irrespective of the time since surgery to rule out infection or instability. the probable causes:surgical retraction of nerve that may have caused it to bruise. investigations to be done:none if symptoms are not progressively worsening. differential diagnosis:recurrent disc herniation. treatment plan:gabapentin or pregabalin and nsaids. regarding follow up:for further doubts consult a spine surgeon online. ---> <link>,why does my friend have numbness after hemilaminectomy surgery?,['tingling sensation'],ic

"a person with a positive skin test a normal chest x-ray and no symptoms most likely has only a few tb germs in an inactive state and is not contagious. nevertheless treatment with an antibiotic may be recommended for this person to prevent the tb from turning into an active infection. the antibiotic used for this purpose is called isoniazid. if taken for six to  months it will prevent the tb from becoming active in the future. in fact if a person with a positive skin test does not take inh there is a %-% lifelong risk that the tb will become active. taking isoniazid can be inadvisable (contraindicated) during pregnancy or for those with alcoholism or liver disease. also isoniazid can have side effects. the side effects occur infrequently but a rash can develop and the patient can feel tired or irritable. liver damage from isoniazid is a rare occurrence and typically reverses once the drug is stopped. very rarely however especially in older people the liver damage (inh hepatitis) can even be fatal. it is important therefore for the doctor to monitor a patient's liver by periodically ordering blood tests called ""liver function tests"" during the course of inh therapy. another side effect of inh is a decreased sensation in the extremities referred to as a peripheral neuropathy. this can be avoided by taking vitamin  (pyridoxine) and this is often prescribed along with inh. a person with a positive skin test along with an abnormal chest x-ray and sputum evidencing tb bacteria has active tb and is contagious. active tb usually is accompanied by symptoms such as a cough fever weight loss and fatigue. active tb is treated with a combination of medications along with isoniazid. rifampin (rifadin) ethambutol (myambutol) and pyrazinamide are the drugs commonly used to treat active tb in conjunction with isoniazid (inh). four drugs are often taken for the first two months of therapy to help kill any potentially resistant strains of bacteria. then the number is usually reduced to two drugs for the remainder of the treatment based on drug sensitivity testing that is usually available by this time in the course. streptomycin a drug that is given by injection may be used as well particularly when the disease is extensive and/or the patients do not take their oral medications reliably (termed ""poor compliance""). treatment usually lasts for many months and sometimes for years. successful treatment of tb is dependent largely on the compliance of the patient. indeed the failure of a patient to take the medications is the most important cause of failure to cure the tb infection. in some locations the health department demands direct monitoring of patient compliance with therapy. surgery on the lungs may be indicated to help cure tb when medication has failed but in this day and age surgery for tb is unusual. treatment with appropriate antibiotics will usually cure the tb. without treatment however tuberculosis can be a lethal infection. therefore early diagnosis is important. those individuals who have been exposed to a person with tb or suspect that they have been should be examined by a doctor for signs of tb and screened with a tb skin test.",how is tuberculosis treated?,['tuberculosis'],wmd

"doctors usually define diarrhea as a significant increase in the total weight of stool passed in a single day. most people however think of diarrhea as an illness during which they have more frequent loose watery stools. almost everyone has diarrhea at some point in his or her life. in developing countries where illnesses that cause diarrhea are more common and where health care is less readily available diarrhea is a major health concern because of its potential to cause severe life-threatening dehydration. infants and the elderly are more prone to dehydration from diarrhea. diarrhea that comes on suddenly and goes away over a period of a couple of weeks is usually referred to as ""acute diarrhea.

"i'm sorry your mother is going through this and hope the ulcer heals soon. what your doctor called a ""bleeding ulcer"" is usually called a "" peptic ulcer "" today. the likely reason the doctor called this a ""stress ulcer"" is because it used to be thought that mental or emotional stress caused an increase in the production of stomach acid which in turn could eat through a small area of the stomach lining and cause an ulcer (which is a little sore on the inside of the stomach or intestine). however there's no real scientific evidence to support the theory that mental stress causes an increase in stomach acid that leads to ulcers. this relationship may exist but it's not proven. it's still being investigated. that said if your mother is under a lot of stress in her life she owes it to herself to engage in some stress reduction activities. simple things like taking five minutes to close her eyes and focus on deep breathing exercises can help reduce stress levels. physical activity also is a great stress management tool. listening to music praying or meditating going for a walk -- any or all of these things can reduce the body's physical response to mental stress. if your mom needs help with stress management she can find many resources on the internet. wishing you both well!",the dr. called my mothers bleeding ulcer a stress ulcer. what does that mean?,"['ulcer', 'stress']",wmd

i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder with major highs (euphoria) appx  years ago that co-occured with adult adhd aggressive personality and anger issues. i was medicated with lamicta serquel and adderall. needless to say i was on a roller coaster and after a while no longer desired medical help. over the last  years i've slipped off into a whirl wind of mental problems. i have now encountered high blood pressure tmj panic attacks multiple fractures in my lower limbs (without known cause) due to avascular necrosis which is medical terms for death of bone i also over the last  / years had constant headaches with up to as many as  migraines (go to the er type) a month i do not sleep well and grind my teeth in return broken them i have unexplained pains and aches throughout most of my body on a daily bases some that go as quickly as they came my outburst are  worse now than ever. mostly in the evening time when my children and husband get home my reproductive system after stopping treatment failed and unfortunately after  cyst were removed and my sons premature birth i was basically pushed into having a partial hystercotomy i have sinus infections around every - weeks with  known cyst in my left sinus cavities. i just recently (last week) went back to my dr a new one and briefly told her what my issues were and how i havent been treated in several years. she has started me on a low dose of adderall again and recommended i see a specialist to combine biopolar treatment. she doesnt know my deepest struggles or demons and i've learned to mask my problems around strangers if possible so answering her questionnaire was simple as not being quite honest due to my own fears of being judged. bipolar affected my grandmother my aunt one of my cousins. i'd say my mother is borderline and my younger brother is. i unfortunately see it in my daughter who is only  and my oldest son who is nearly  is hard to tell cause he is adhd but i believe it is masking bipolar because he is very depressed alot but also has been through some tough stuff with me and other problems. i have found that i turn to other releases due to pain management of other physical issues though i feel okay for an hour or so any pain meds prescribed to me tend to accelerate my mood swings and i've found them to be addicting mentally though i never intended to use them for other than my multiple breaks. my adderall definitely intensifies panic mainly in the evening. but its ultimately a huge help for the morning due to shuffling kids and my husband and i own our own company. i cant work with the public due to this nor be in social situations. my marriage has been a disaster for atleast  / years and it is me but now my husband has became moody as well and i do whole heartedly believe it started due to my mental problems. i do not at the moment take anything other than my adderall and pain meds for my fractures and honestly decided today i dont really think adderall is the best thing unless im treated with something else for the moods. i still have to make an appt with a specialized dr and treatment will take quite sometime because of my fear of drs due to years back when all this started they put me on so so so many different meds i felt like a lab rat and nothing seemed to truly work and i dont really honestly open up to a dr. i will never tell them about my addictions nor will i ever tell them my increased thoughts of suicide. many things can co-exist with bipolar. mimic it. mask it. and everyone is different. it is a horrible disease unfortunately and is something when you hit rock bottom if you have the courage and will to get help you will. if you are like me you'll ruin everything you have because of fear. and honestly this is the first time i've truly opened up about certain things i feel or that i have associated with my bipolar. some may see these things or believe i experience these things but i do not truly discuss them with anyone not my mother. my husband (most i do) or my dr.,what illnesses often co-exist with bipolar disorder?,['bipolar disorder'],wmd

"this question doesn't have a straightforward answer unfortunately. the active ingredient in marijuana is called delta--tetrahydrocannabinol or ""thc"" for short. when a person smokes marijuana the thc is rapidly absorbed by the body which causes the person to feel ""high. "" this effect is short-lived lasting maybe three or four hours. however an inactive form of thc (called delta thc-acid) deposits itself in the fatty tissue. this is called the ""metabolite"" of thc. many marijuana tests don't look for active thc in the blood stream or urine. instead they look for this thc metabolite. despite a common belief that it takes longer for heavy pot users to ""test clean"" than someone who smoked marijuana just one time there isn't much scientific evidence to support that idea. every individual's body is unique. some people's bodies may clear the thc metabolite more rapidly than others. detecting thc depends on the type of test used also. some very sensitive tests can measure delta thc-acid levels up to  days after the person stopped using marijuana. while it would be nice to have a solid answer to the question of how long thc stays in your system after smoking marijuana it's just not possible to say with certainty.",how long does thc stay in your system?,[],wmd

the best answer to your question is this: call your surgeon's office and ask. if the boil is not located anywhere near the surgical area the surgeon probably will simply proceed with the surgery. but that's his or her decison and the sooner you alert the office to this development the better it will be for everyone. if the boil is located in the surgical area it still may not be a problem. in fact the surgeon may decide to remove the boil during the surgery. it all depends on what type of surgery you're having and in what area of the body. but anyway as i said the best thing you can do is call your surgeon's office and let them know. surgical scheduling is an art all unto itself and if your case has to be delayed it's better for the surgeon's scheduler to know about it as far in advance as possible. wishing you all the best!,i am going to have surgery and i have a boil. should i go? i have  days to get rid of it.,"['boil', 'surgery']",wmd

"this is a very interesting question. thank you for asking! i can think of one very good reason why you might experience these symptoms while engaging in a competitive gaming situation: the fight-or-flight response. when you are competing you probably feel stressed. you want to win! and you are very highly focused on performing well. this combination of factors could stimulate your sympathetic nervous system (sns) to respond. the sns responds to acute stress by producing a series of changes within your body often call the ""fight or flight response. "" during fight-or-flight your pupils dilate to better allow light into the eye and assess escape routes (or in your case see the video field better); your breathing accelerates; your heart rate increases; your blood pressure rises; your digestive processes slow way down; and your bladder sphincter may suddenly relax (oops! ). important to our discussion though is the fact the sns stress response diverts blood flow from the extremities to the muscles. this is probably the reason your hands and feet become cold -- your sns is diverting that blood to your core and to the large muscles of your body in case you must jump up and run away from whatever danger your brain has perceived. fight-or-flight is a primal reaction so the ""threat"" your sns is responding to could be the competition or the action occurring in the video game itself. when the sns kicks in you usually feel an adrenalin rush. the sns causes your body to be flooded with other hormones too including testosterone and cortisol. if you feel that an sns response is in fact responsible for your cold hands and feet while gaming you can take steps to address the problem. try meditating for several minutes before a competition. focus on your breathing and keep it slow and regulated. if possible focus on your breathing during the competition too. you may be surprised to discover how much you can control your body's response to stress. wishing you well!",when playing competitive video games my hands and feet become very cold. when the game is over it's back to normal y? . it's just when i play a competitive match. if i play a casual/relaxed game i do not get this effect.,"['hand', 'foot', 'coldness']",wmd

if they have some leftover darvocet i would not recommend taking that. we also want to make sure that people understand that they should not be saving medications and keeping them in their cabinets for a rainy day. they need to dispose off them so therefore there is no risk of possible poisonings or teen drug abuse. so one of the things we recommend now is disposing of your medications but not flushing them down the toilet. there is a new procedure that's very easy to follow and all it requires is a ziploc bag. get a ziploc bag and pour the medication into it. put a little water into it to help it dissolve. you may want to crush it; take a hammer or a mallet and actually make sure it dissolves even more. then take something like kitty litter or coffee grinds or sawdust and put it in the bag to make it very unattractive. zip up the bag and put it in the trash it's that easy. why is it so important that we want to get rid of our medications? because unfortunately today teen drug abuse has really become a big problem especially in pain medications. we find out that teens are going to their medicine cabinets right in their house and taking extra medications that were not used anymore.,i have some leftover darvocet. is it safe to take that at my next schedule dosing time?,[],wmd
this is a tricky question to answer because every person metabolizes (breaks down and eliminates) medications and other substances at different rates. sex body mass and other factors also can influence how fast a person clears any given substance from the body. for example a person with decreased liver or kidney function may metabolize a substance more slowly than someone else. when it comes to marijuana the amount you smoke may affect how quickly the active ingredient (thc) may be detectable in the blood for longer periods of time among heavier smokers than among occasional smokers. in general blood testing for marijuana (thc) is performed to measure impairment such as in driving while under the influence cases. some experts say marijuana is detectable in the blood for up to a week among regular smokers. despite the legalization of recreational and medical marijuana in some states you should understand the effects of marijuana usage on your body and you should never ever drive after using marijuana. reaction times can be severely impaired after using marijuana which makes driving unsafe for yourself and everyone else on the road. please make smart choices about your health! wishing you well! order % legit n safe medical marijuana pain relievers cbd oils dabs and more. for more info text () - lisanblakeretailshop@gmail. com medical marijuana is good for your health top medical strains for all patients suffering from depression glaucoma anxiety and tension headaches chronic pain and nausea mental and physical fatigue and for calming aromatherapy then you are in the right place to look in our meds all top grade aa+ with high level of cbd and thc contact for your supply and good health. pain killers medical marijuana act. lean ***(( no prescribtion is needed))) bud seeds harsh oils dabs & other m. m treatments. we also sefely and securely deliver all sorts of generic medication and syrup nationwide at very good prices. no prescribtions needed. legit verified and reputed plug. available in the u. s canada australia and the uk. for more info text () - lisanblakeretailshop@gmail. com. thank you. sdsd,how long does marijuana stay in your blood?,['marijuana'],wmd

"this is an excellent question - and one you should ask the surgeon who performed the breast reduction. when i served as a reconstructive surgery nurse the doctor i worked with recommended a new baseline mammogram  months after breast reduction surgery. breast reduction surgery changes the ""architecture"" of your breasts and causes scar tissue deposits to develop so it's important to establish a new baseline image for a radiologist to compare your results against in the future. by the six-month post-surgical mark all of the absorbable suture should have dissolved and not appear on the mammo image. also you should be sufficiently healed so the mammogram isn't overly painful. the guideline i've mentioned here may not align with your surgeon's preferences which is why you should speak to him or her. also my comments only pertain to uncomplicated breast reduction cases. if you have developed a lump or other lesion that requires investigation with a mammogram then you should not necessarily delay the imaging test just because you recently had a breast reduction procedure. you should instead discuss the situation with your doctor and move forward with the recommended testing. wishing you well!",when can a mammogram be done after breast reduction?,"['mammogram', 'breast']",wmd

in the united states approximately   people contract hbv  each year. however only   to   of these people develop a chronic hepatitis b infection. why do some people clear the virus from their bodies while others progress to chronic disease? it appears that the immune system is the most important factor in determining whether a person can rid herself of this virus rather than develop a persistent infection. the immune system is relatively immature early in life. therefore the younger a person is when hbv is contracted the greater the likelihood that the infected person will become a chronic carrier of the disease. if an adult is infected her probability of developing chronic disease is very low—approximately  to  percent. if a person contracts the infection in infancy there is as much as a - to -percent chance that her immune system will be unable to eliminate this virus from her body. children fall somewhere in between having approximately a  to  percent chance of going on to chronic disease. men are six times more likely than women to become chronic carriers of hbv. the reason for this has not been determined. also people with poor immune systems—such as those infected with hiv organ recipients and those undergoing chemotherapy—have a much lower success rate of eliminating the virus from their bodies. patients who are the sickest during their acute illness especially those who develop jaundice or who survive fulminant hepatitis have the highest likelihood of totally recovering and thus not progressing to a chronic disease.,what are the chances of hepatitis b becoming a chronic disease?,['hepatitis b'],wmd

the complex process of digestion affects the timing location and particular symptoms of an allergic reaction to food. all of the symptoms of food allergy occur within a few minutes to an hour of eating. a food allergy can initially be experienced as an itching in the mouth and difficulty swallowing and breathing. then during digestion of the food in the stomach and intestines symptoms such as nausea vomiting diarrhea and abdominal pain can start. incidentally the gastrointestinal symptoms of food allergy are those that are most often confused with the symptoms of different types of food intolerance. as mentioned previously the allergens are absorbed and enter the bloodstream. when they reach the skin allergens can induce hives or eczema and when they reach the airways they can cause asthma. as the allergens travel through the blood vessels they can cause lightheadedness weakness and anaphylaxis which is a sudden drop in blood pressure. anaphylactic reactions are severe even when they start off with mild symptoms such as a tingling in the mouth and throat or discomfort in the abdomen. they can be fatal if not treated quickly.,what are the symptoms and signs of food allergy?,['food allergy'],wmd

fava beans grow in a large pod that needs to be peeled in order to find the beans that lie within. if you have small children this is an excellent task for them. once you get all the beans out of their pods there are a few more simple steps. the outer shell of the bean is kind of chalky and not good eating. you need to blanch the pods (put them quickly into boiling water then plunge them into ice water). from there you can pop them out of their shells and enjoy them with a bit of extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkle of salt and pepper and a shave of parmesan cheese. you can use them to top a piece of your favorite fish or a piece of grilled chicken. when fava beans are young you can actually eat the outside as well as the inside. for those heat up a cast iron skillet and add a bit of olive oil. when its almost smoking throw the fava beans in whole add a bit of lemon juice chili flakes and salt and pepper and in about - minutes they are ready to eat. if you can find fava beans at your local farmers market or grocery store give them a try!,what are some easy and delicious ways to prepare fava beans?,[],wmd

the answer is: it depends. you need to discuss this with your gynecologist. many factors affect whether or not a tubal ligation reversal may be successful. some of these factors are: your age your general health status the type of tubal ligation procedure you had whether or not you previously had a successful pregnancy whether or not you have had any other gynecological surgeries such as for endometriosis or fibroid tumors these are not the only considerations. obviously if you're past the age of menopause reversing your tubal ligation will not enable you to get pregnant because you're no longer producing eggs. because it's been so long since you had your tubes tied the records about the type of procedure performed may no longer be available. however if the doctor who performed the procedure is still practicing you might consult him or her to discover if the records are available. taking this information to your current gynecologist will be helpful in determining if tubal ligation reversal might be successful for you. wishing you all the best!,can a tubal ligation be reversed. its been  and ahalf years since i have my tubes tired. me and my partner would like to have a baby sometime in the next  to  years can my tubal ligation be reversed so i can get pregnant,"['pregnancy', 'tubal ligation', 'drowsiness', 'baby']",wmd
about % of people have no symptoms when they first acquire hepatitis c infection. the remaining % may complain of fatigue loss of appetite muscle aches or fever. yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice) is rare at this early stage of infection. over time the liver in people with chronic infection may begin to experience the effects of the persistent inflammation caused by the immune reaction to the virus. blood tests may show elevated levels of liver enzymes a sign of liver damage which is often the first suggestion that the infection may be present. patients may become easily fatigued or complain of nonspecific symptoms. as cirrhosis develops symptoms increase and may include : weakness. loss of appetite. weight loss. breast enlargement in men. a rash on the palms. difficulty with the clotting of blood. spider-like blood vessels on the skin. in patients with advanced cirrhosis the liver begins to fail. this is a life-threatening problem. confusion and even coma (encephalopathy) may result from the inability of the liver to process certain toxic substances. increased pressure in the blood vessels of the liver (portal hypertension) may cause fluid to build up in the abdominal cavity (ascites) and result in engorged veins in the swallowing tube (esophageal varices) that tear easily and can bleed suddenly and massively. portal hypertension also can cause kidney failure or an enlarged spleen resulting in a decrease of blood cells and the development of anemia increased risk of infection and bleeding. in advanced cirrhosis liver failure causes decreased production of clotting factors. patients with advanced cirrhosis often develop jaundice because the damaged liver is unable to eliminate a yellow compound called bilirubin that is formed from the hemoglobin of old red blood cells.,what are the symptoms of hepatitis c infection?,"['hepatitis c', 'infection']",wmd

osteoarthritis (ah-stee-oh-ar-threye-tis) is the most common type of arthritis and is seen especially among older people. sometimes it is called degenerative joint disease or osteoarthrosis. osteoarthritis mostly affects cartilage (kar-til-uj) the hard but slippery tissue that covers the ends of bones where they meet to form a joint. healthy cartilage allows bones to glide over one another. it also absorbs energy from the shock of physical movement. in osteoarthritis the surface layer of cartilage breaks down and wears away. this allows bones under the cartilage to rub together causing pain swelling and loss of motion of the joint. over time the joint may lose its normal shape. also small deposits of bone – called osteophytes or bone spurs – may grow on the edges of the joint. bits of bone or cartilage can break off and float inside the joint space. this causes more pain and damage. people with osteoarthritis usually have joint pain and some movement limitations. unlike some other forms of arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis affects only joint function and does not affect skin tissue the lungs the eyes or the blood vessels. in rheumatoid arthritis the second most common form of arthritis the immune system attacks the tissues of the joints leading to pain inflammation and eventually joint damage and malformation. it typically begins at a younger age than osteoarthritis causes swelling and redness in joints and may make people feel sick tired and uncommonly feverish.,what is osteoarthritis?,['osteoarthritis'],wmd

it is very difficult to reach a definitive diagnosis with the information that you have given about your  year old nephew but i will still hint at the possibilities. the first possibility to consider is that of disruptive behavioral disorder characterised by destructive and disobedient behaviors as in your nephew like hitting others yelling calling others stupid and missing school  out of  days. as children age oppositional and defiant behavior may continue and result in children having persisting conflicts with adults and peers at home and at school. the other likely possibility though is that of autism as indicated by stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms of opening and closing of hands plus the speech problems like inability to sustain a conversation delay in development of spoken language(as you said that his speech is hard to understand) preoccupation with stereotyped interest(as in going to bathroom on the porch). the other likely possibility is that of premorbid stage of childhood schizophrenia in the form of disorganized speech(before he can finish one talk he stops and talks about something different and completely unrelated) aggressive behaviour disruptive behaviour alternating moods inappropriate to environment school problems etc. the only thing missing is the presence of delusions and hallucinations which usually do not develop before mid adolescence. so it is difficult to commit schizophrenia but still suggestive of premorbid stage suggesting the likelihood of developing into full fledged schizophrenia in adolescent years of life. all above are the likely possibilities only as it is not possible to reach definitive diagnosis without detailed interview of child and parents and observation of the child in person. you must consult your pediatrician for the same as early intervention is always helpful in treating the psychopathology. hope this helps. take care.,my nephew who is four years has very bad mood swings and stops what he is doing and starts opening and closing of his hands. he tells his mother that he wants to break her bones and break the house. he goes to the bathroom on the porch and steps in ti and thinks it's funny. he is in time out at school  out of  days and the daycare provider said he needs to be seen by a doctor. my sister is so frustrated she doesn't know what to do. other things he does is spit at people hit others punches his mom yells a lot calls eveyone stupid says he wants to hurt animals and people. his speech is hard to understand. he starts a conversation and be fore he can finish he'll stop and talk about something completly different. my sister doesn't know what to do. she thinks possible autism. what do you think?,"['autism signs', 'autism', 'behavioral disorder', 'early intervention', 'pediatrician', 'alternating', 'aggressive', 'behaviors', 'diagnosis', 'childhood', 'autism']",eh
masturbation is a choice. it is definitely not necessary. eating is necessary. drinking is necessary. paying taxes is necessary. masturbation is optional. masturbation is not a necessity and if a person does not want to engage in the practice there is no reason that he should; however if he opts not to masturbate and it is not due to reasons such as religious beliefs being too busy enjoys exerting willpower etc. he may want to consider consulting with a doctor in case he has a low libido and might want to take steps to address that issue. on a separate note all men should keep an eye on their penis health; using a top notch penis health cream (health professionals recommend  man oil) can help. a good bet is a cream that includes l-arginine which can help with penis blood flow issues. hi o the joys of a j arthur one of the wrist spank the monkey bash the bishop yes these all mean to masturbate with the pleasure of ones own penis. its something we don't did to do but if your feeling horny and your wife g/f are not around then being men we just did it don't put it off don't try and hold back from it its not dirty and don't be ashamed but it will make you fell relaxed. its something you can do in the shower the bath in the car(but not why your driving or why taken a walk in the country. as men do we need it your read at some point that some men can go through there whole life and say never done that! but doing it is good for our prostate keeps our system ticking over till we do need it so yes in one way we do need to masturbate why our body's need it so for that just once or twice a week will not hurt you. but don't forget don't use a tight grip it needs to be feather light just like the feel of the vagina and use some oil just baby oil will do or some olive oil if your in the kitchen shower gel when in the shower gives that extra clean same in the bath or just a bar of soap it all helps. do hope this helps. good luck,im . is masturbation a must if you have never had sex or ejaculate? is it really necessary?,"['masturbation', 'sexual intercourse', 'ejaculation']",wmd

medical researchers aren't sure exactly how stress increases the risk of heart disease. stress itself might be a risk factor or it could be that high levels of stress make other risk factors (such as high cholesterol or high blood pressure) worse. for example if you are under stress your blood pressure goes up you may overeat you may exercise less and you may be more likely to smoke. if stress itself is a risk factor for heart disease it could be because chronic stress exposes your body to unhealthy persistently elevated levels of stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol. studies also link stress to changes in the way blood clots which increases the risk of heart attack.,how does stress contribute to heart disease?,"['heart disease', 'stress']",wmd

many people dont realize that winter itch is a form of eczema one that tends to run in families. if your parents have it chances are that you and your children will develop it too. even babies can suffer from winter itch. even if you are genetically prone to eczema you can still take steps to protect your skin which may prevent eczema or at least ensure only a mild case. first of all moisturize your skin. this is the crucial step because you want to keep the skin barrier intact. even if it has turned warm again outside now is the time to start using the most effective moisturizers you can find. drugstores sell inexpensive yet highly effective petrolatum-based ointments and creams that are heavy enough to protect the skin. it is a very good idea to use these or a moisturizing lotion right after your bath or shower when the skin is still damp. oils work well too. for daytime wear when you may want to use something a little lighter and less greasy look for creams and lotions that contain hyaluronic acid shea butter avocado oil or glycerin. dimethicone a silicone-based ingredient works for many but not for those whose skin is prone to acne since it can increase breakouts. hands contain comparatively few oil glands and tend to dry and crack easily. the use of those alcohol-based sanitizers doesnt help either. not only do they dry skin more than good old soap and water theyarent as effective at killing viruses and bacteria. actually you dont even have to use soap which is undeniably drying to wash your hands. products marketed as gentle cleansers for sensitive skins work beautifully; carry a small bottle in your bag and use it instead of those scented soaps in public restrooms. in fact stay away from scented soaps period since they tend to irritate the skin. as for deodorant soaps they are absolutely terrible for anybody prone to winter itch – ditch them immediately! take shorter showers and baths and try to use a moisturizing body wash or a super-fatted soap. ifyour skin is very sensitive you can use the same gentle facial cleanser i recommend for hands.,what can i do to minimize itching and redness from eczema and winter itch?,"['atopic dermatitis', 'itch']",wmd
i'm sorry to hear about your fall. that's certainly never pleasant! it's impossible to tell what's going on without performing a physical examination but i'm going to take a stab at this. i'm thinking you may have irritated or injured the patellar tendon where it attaches to the tibial tuberosity. let me explain that in laymen's terms. the patella of course is the kneecap. it is attached to the lower leg by a tendon. if you bend your knee and feel the very top of your shin bone you'll notice a bony bump. this is the tibial tuberosity (the 'tibia' being the medical term for your shin bone). the patellar ligament attaches to the tibial tuberosity. if you fell onto that area of your knee you very likely may have injured the tendon. the bad news is this can take a long (long) time to heal. tendons have poor blood circulation which means the tissue doesn't get as much oxygen as say muscle tissue does. and since oxygen is crucial to tissue repair it takes tendons and ligaments much longer to heal than other body tissues. on the plus side it probably will heal eventually. assuming you did in fact injure the patellar tendon your best course of action is to avoid doing anything else to irritate it. that means no kneeling no activities that cause lots of bending (such as playing soccer) and things like that. rest will help your leg heal. if you're not allergic to them anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen can help the pain. if the pain persists you can always get re-checked to see if this is indeed a soft tissue injury. wishing you well!,tripped & fell. experienced excruciating knee pain when attempted to kneel  days later. xrays were normal. help!,[],wmd

inguinal hernias typically flatten or disappear when they are pushed gently back into place or when you lie down. over time hernias tend to increase in size as the abdominal muscle wall becomes weaker and more tissue bulges through. if you can't push your hernia back into your belly it is incarcerated. a hernia gets incarcerated when tissue moves into the sac of the hernia and fills it up. this is not necessarily an emergency. but if a loop of the intestine is trapped very tightly in the hernia the blood supply to that part of the intestine can be cut off ( strangulated ) causing tissue to die. in a man if tissue is trapped the testicle and its blood vessels can also be damaged. a strangulated hernia is a medical emergency that requires immediate surgery. in adults a hernia that can be pushed back into the abdomen can be surgically repaired at a convenient time. this is because incarceration is rare in adults. a hernia that cannot be pushed back can be repaired when surgery is convenient unless you have increased pain redness of the overlying skin fever nausea and vomiting or abdominal bloating. if any of these symptoms occur the hernia may need to be fixed sooner. inguinal hernias can come back after surgical repair. but in women it is rare for inguinal hernias to recur. fertility is usually not affected by an inguinal hernia or hernia surgery. but in males there is a chance that surgery or an incarcerated hernia can cause injury to the vas deferens the tube that carries sperm from the testicles to the urethra. it is not yet known how often or to what degree this affects a man's ability to father a child. in rare cases surgery or an incarcerated hernia may injure the blood vessels that supply one or both testicles with blood which may cause the affected testicle to shrink. hernias in children infants or children with an inguinal hernia need to have surgery as soon as possible because of the increased risk that a part of the intestine will become trapped and blood supply will be cut off leading to tissue death. incarceration when intestinal or abdominal tissue fills up the sac of a hernia occurs in about  or  out of  infants younger than  months who have hernias. most incarcerated hernias occur before the infant is  year old.  female infants face a higher risk of incarceration. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,what happens to someone when they get inguinal hernia?,['hernia'],wmd

i'm sorry to hear you're going through this. it sounds miserable and worrisome. i want to emphasize your need to stay hydrated even if drinking water gives you nausea. maybe try drinking water at different temperatures to see if one is more palatable than another. or see if there's a vitamin water flavored water or type of sports drink you can tolerate. despite the fact you've been tested for celiac and other conditions in the past my advice to you is to keep pursuing a cause for your symptoms. some conditions take a long time to be diagnosed such as gastroparesis. sometimes tests need to be repeated periodically and the results compared in order to reach a diagnosis. it's ok to be very pro-active with your health care providers in pushing for additional testing or repeated tests (depending on how much time has elapsed) in order to get a diagnosis. i'd suggest keeping copies of all your lab results and imaging films. usually these can be provided to you on cds for easy storage. you'll want to keep these for new doctors you may consult and for comparison of test results over time. i wish i had some magic suggestion to offer you in terms of a diagnosis but that's not the case. like i said hang in there and don't give up just because you've had a few tests done. keep going back to your provider(s) to let them know you still have symptoms. i wish you all the best!,i have severe abdomenal pain. i get stomach spams whenever i eat or drink anything. i'm nauseous all the time. morning nausea (not pregnant or hungover). severe stomach spasms when i eat or drink anything (even water makes me nauseous). very tired to the point i'm light headed and get a severe migraine. sharp pains from my lower abdomen. basically anything i eat or drink gives me nausea and a severe spasm. . i've been tested for caeliac and have had many blood tests and urine tests done. . please help.,"['stomach', 'blood test', 'lightheadedness', 'nausea', 'abdominal pain']",wmd

most helpful answer oh ouch! sorry to hear you went through this. the sacrifices we make to look good right? ! it sounds to me from your description like the wound healing process is proceeding along a normal course. that brownish/yellowish goop you see likely is caused by an excessive number of protein cells. the body tends to overcompensate a little when trying to heal a wound like this. unless you spike a fever (over ) and start feeling nauseated or something you're probably good to go. i'm sure your doctor gave you wound care instructions. you don't need to scrub that goo off but you can cleanse the wound with cool soapy water and pat dry. the silver sulfadiazine was a great choice for this type of burn. that stuff is nearly miraculous in my opinion. a thin layer is all you need. eventually this will wound scab over. it sounds like you might have a scar from this burn. if that concerns you feel free to consult your physician again after it's healed for some options about how to minimize the scar. all the best to you!,burn to inside of forearm  days ago from hot curling iron. been treating with silver sulfadiazine. still oozing-wet. i dropped my curling iron onto my shoulder and forearm  days ago. the burn to my shoulder is  x  inches. the burn to the inside of my forearm is  x / inches and more severe. the doc prescribed silver sulfadiazine to be applied twice a day and covered with stick-free gauze squares. the blisters broke almost right away. very little pain but still looks open raw and is oozing brownish yellowish goop. is it normal for it to ooze after  days and still look open?,"['burn', 'forearm', 'shoulder', 'iron', 'blister']",wmd

i was exposed to poison ivy when i was a teenager and after taking steroids it went away but it comes back most years (i am now <positive_smiley> and some years it returns  or  times without any exposure to poison ivy plants. it starts in my wrists and ankles with small bumps and in a day or two can spread to most of my arms and legs. sometimes it even spreads to my face and abdominal area. when it becomes really severe i go to the doctor and get steroids and have also done really long tempers (take medicine for about a month decreasing dosage each time until it is finished). it always comes back regardless of the amount of medication and shots i am prescribed by doctors. which clearly indicates it must be in my bloodstream and remains there. to deal with itch i use benadryl gel and white vinegar but over the years have tried pretty much every product available over the counter recommended for poison ivy and others that are not. it still itches and over the years i have definitely become more tolerant of the itchiness but wish there was a cure. doctors keep telling me i have to be exposed to it every time in order to get it which is clearly not the case. i wonder what damage if any it is causing in my body. i sympathize with those who get it. i hope someone studies this one day and finds a cure!,can poison ivy rash return same place after  months? . rash returned same places on arms after  months since had first rash. . haven't been any where near any plants no pets to come in contact with poison ivy. any one ever hear of this happening?,"['arm', 'rash', 'plant', 'poison ivy', 'pets']",wmd
up until fairly recently the only way to reverse sun damage was to have laser treatments chemical peels or use retinols and prescription tretinoin creams. a revolutionary innovation in the cosmeceutical industry is changing that. now all you may need to do is go to your drugstore or department store and look for products that contain dna repair ingredients. these ingredients now come in every product imaginable — creams lotions serums sunscreens. and heres the wonderful thing: they really do work. dna skin repair ingredients are usually based on enzymes derived from a variety of sources including plankton and plants. most of the major skin care companies are already selling dna repair products and are closely following the new research. all these products seem to improve the skin so it is not necessary to buy the most expensive one. these enzymes work by restoring dna that has been damaged by free radicals most often caused by sun exposure pollution and other environmental factors. dna damage is what causes sagging wrinkles and rough-textured skin. in other words its what makes you look old. dna repair products dont seem to fade brown spots though and though they soften fine lines they wont have the dramatic effect of botox or hyaluronic acid fillers that plump deep creases. still people really notice a difference after a few weeks of using these products and they are usually happy with the results. one of the advantages of most dna repair products is that unlike tretinoin and retinols (which should only be used at night) they do not interact with sunlight and can be used during the day. in fact a few sunscreens already include dna repair ingredients. although the research is still coming in this may be the wave of the future in sun protection.,do dna skin repair products really work?,[],wmd

starting in  the affordable care act changes the eligibility rules for medicaid so generally people who haven't qualified before may do so now. the deciding factor is income. if you earn slightly less than $  annually you can qualify. but here's the rub -- a number of states including florida -- have declined to expand medicaid under the new law. that means people like yourself who might otherwise qualify for medicaid coverage won't have that as an option. however if you make roughly $  or more you can look to your state's health insurance marketplace which will open october . you'll be able to shop for health insurance and if you qualify you'll get a tax break to help cover the cost of a health plan. if your income is very low the price break could be quite substantial. in addition you may also qualify for subsidies that will lower your costs each time you go the doctor. i suggest you check out the state pages here at webmd which will give you a good idea about the details of what will be available to you in florida. also sign yourself up for information about the marketplaces at healthcare. gov. good luck!,i am a  yr old unemployed widow in florida. can i get medicaid? . i have no income but no dependent children. i am  and unemployed.,"['medicaid', 'florida']",wmd

this sounds just exactly like an issue that i dealt with for months in . hubby and i went on vacation and on the last couple of days i was having an itch right at my waist line in the back. it wasn't too bad and i didn't think too much of it at the time. it would come and go. the day we got home it got worse. i looked in the mirror and there was a couple of spots each about the size of a quarter that looked like hives. i put an ice pack on it to relieve the itching and after half an hour or so it went away. over the course of about  months my nutritionist and i tried and tried to figure it out but it would just come and go several times a day. sometimes on my arms other times it was on my stomach or legs or back. very random. at times it would be circular in shape. other times it would show up as long lines or irregular shapes. definitely looked like hives though. then suddenly it just stopped. i realized one day that it had been a week and no new out breaks. it started on our vacation in august  and ended sometime around november/december . then just this past week it happened again. i noticed my arm pits itching a little one evening but again didn't think much of it. wasn't too bad just a little annoyance a couple times. the next morning i woke up to bright red pits and the same hive looking spots on my stomach. i started thinking about what was different during the time that i didn't have the hives. the only thing i could come up with was the while on our vacation last year we had lots of specialty coffee drinks from a famous coffee shop that i won't name here. i continued to have them several times a week until sometime in the fall don't remember when. just last weekend we decided to have them again a couple times that weekend. large ones. two days later the hives were back. that makes me sad but i guess maybe i need to lay off the expensive coffee drinks and just have my coffee here at home. it can be different things for different people but thought i would mention this just in case it might help someone else. i never thought at the time that my coffee drinks could be the problem (and it may just be a coincidence) but for now i think i'll avoid them.,i have a itchy rash that comes and goes what could be causing this? . the rash appears in different areas of my body for an example a rash showed up on my wrist and stayed a while and went away. later the same day it appeared on my stomach and then on my thighs etc. its itchy while it is present. at one point my hands first turned red and then start to itch really bad to the point i had to wash my hands repeatedly. i work in the medical field so i wash my hands a million times a day. what could be causing this reaction?,"['hand', 'thigh', 'wrist', 'rash', 'reaction']",wmd

surgery is one of two main treatments for early-stage prostate cancer. radiation is the other. surgery may be done to remove the prostate and its cancer. it may done to remove and test lymph nodes in the area to see whether the cancer has spread. it also may be done to fix urinary problems that are caused by a tumor pressing on the urethra. the stage of your prostate cancer along with your age and general health will affect the type of surgery you choose. surgery choices radical prostatectomy is an operation to remove the entire prostate and any nearby tissue that may contain cancer. it can be done as open surgery through an incision (cut) in the belly or as laparoscopic surgery through several very small incisions in the belly. laparoscopic surgery is done with a tiny camera and special instruments to remove the prostate. sometimes lymph nodes in the area also are removed so that they can be checked for signs of cancer. this is called a lymph node biopsy nerve-sparing surgery helps preserve the nerves that are along the side of the prostate and that are needed for an erection. this is only done when there is little chance of leaving cancer cells behind. if you already have sexual function issues nerve-sparing surgery may not be the best choice for you. laparoscopic surgery is most often done by hand. a few doctors now do this surgery by guiding robotic arms that hold the surgery tools. this is called robot-assisted prostatectomy. what to think about removing the prostate can cause erection problems and bladder problems. but for many men these problems get better over time. if you and your doctor decide that you need surgery be sure to choose a highly skilled surgeon at a hospital that has a good success rate. studies show that men have fewer side effects from prostate surgery when they have a skilled and experienced surgeon.  surgery may completely remove your prostate cancer. but it is not possible to know for sure before surgery whether the cancer has spread beyond the prostate. when cancer has spread it cannot always be cured with surgery alone. webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor. healthwise disclaims any liability for the decisions you make based on this information. © - healthwise incorporated. healthwise healthwise for every health decision and the healthwise logo are trademarks of healthwise incorporated.,what surgery options do i have for prostate cancer?,"['surgery', 'prostate cancer']",wmd

what you are describing is what i think a blood boil. most people get them like under the arm where you sweat are inside the leg near the scrotch or vagina area. and they can be very painful. my suggestion is to sit in a warm tub of water for as long as you can to get it soft do not put soap in it but put something like lysol the concentrated kind it will kill the germs and it will help as an disinfectant. it will keep the infection down;. it may break on its own and if it does it will have some pus and maybe some blood. in a tub a warm water as warm as you can stand it put about  capfuls of lysol only the kind that is concentrated it should come in a brown bottle. you might could find it in a drug store or in a grocery store where the laundry soap is found. but that is only a temporary fix. if it doesn't pop on its own then go to a doctor he will likely look and see exactly what it is and prescribe antibiotics to help it go away. i went to a doctor cause i had something similar and she popped mine and then she prescribed some medicine and then it went away and i have never had one since. so please seek treatment whatever you feel like is the best option and please let us know what you decide to do. i do hope that you get to feeling better and please keep us informed of your health. we do care and we want to help. thank you,painful  inch swelling between anus and scrotum not a pimple under the skin gives me fever help? . hi . i have a swelling between my scrotum and anus closer to the scrotum . it's size has increased in the last two days . i have had it for  days now it's excruciatingly painful. i have no idea what it is and what to do. . plus it gives me fever so i have taken small doses of paracetamol . it's still somewhat manageable if its kept warm. can you please tell what is it and how can i get better? ways to treat it? . any help would be really really appreciated! . thank you!,"['swelling', 'anus', 'scrotum', 'skin', 'fever']",wmd

when looking for a therapist it is important to find one that is qualified affordable and that you can connect well with. when you first talk with a therapist (either on the phone or in person) consider it an interview to see if the person is right for you. ask about their credentials making sure that they are a licensed psychiatrist psychologist social worker or counselor. offer a thumbnail sketch of your issue and ask if this is the kind of issue that they treat and have expertise with. ask what their approach is and why they think it would be helpful for you. as you listen to these answers think about whether you feel comfortable not only with what they are saying but also with how they are saying it. in terms of finding someone you can afford you might want to try a local clinic hospital or teaching institution (a school that trains therapists might have its own clinic) because they might have a sliding scale. although those in training are less experienced (a downside) and might make you think twice about going they also receive supervision-- and sometimes the training is for experienced people working on a more advanced degree. again if you feel comfortable that is most important (along with proper qualifications). you might want to check with the self-help support group clearinghouse for both self-help groups and recommendations for where to seek sliding scale professional help. try the state or local professional associations (i. e. for psychologists or social workers) and ask if they can direct you. and whoever you call for help if they cannot help ask if they can direct you as to where to get help.,how can i find a reasonably priced qualified mental health counselor?,['mental health'],wmd

the symptoms of hypothyroidism are often subtle. they are not specific (which means they can mimic the symptoms of many other conditions) and are often attributed to aging. patients with mild hypothyroidism may have no signs or symptoms. the symptoms generally become more obvious as the condition worsens and the majority of these complaints are related to a metabolic slowing of the body. common symptoms are listed below: fatigue. depression. modest weight gain. cold intolerance. excessive sleepiness. dry coarse hair. constipation. dry skin. muscle cramps. increased cholesterol levels. decreased concentration. vague aches and pains. swelling of the legs. as the disease becomes more severe there may be puffiness around the eyes a slowing of the heart rate a drop in body temperature and heart failure. in its most profound form severe hypothyroidism may lead to a life-threatening coma (myxedema coma). in a severely hypothyroid individual a myxedema coma tends to be triggered by severe illness surgery stress or traumatic injury. this condition requires hospitalization and immediate treatment with thyroid hormones given by injection. properly diagnosed hypothyroidism can be easily and completely treated with thyroid hormone replacement. on the other hand untreated hypothyroidism can lead to an enlarged heart (cardiomyopathy) worsening heart failure and an accumulation of fluid around the lungs (pleural effusion).,what are the symptoms of hypothyroidism?,['hypothyroidism'],wmd

"when there is too much cholesterol in your blood it builds up in the walls of your arteries. over time this buildup causes the arteries to harden -- a process called atherosclerosis. the arteries become narrowed and blood flow to the heart muscle is slowed down or blocked. the blood carries oxygen to the heart and if enough blood and oxygen cannot reach your heart you may suffer chest pain. if the blood supply to a portion of the heart is completely cut off by a sudden blockage the result is a heart attack. there are two forms of cholesterol that most americans are familiar with: low-density lipoprotein (ldl or ""bad"" cholesterol) and high-density lipoprotein (hdl or ""good"" cholesterol). these are the forms in which cholesterol travels in the blood. ldls have little protein and high levels of cholesterol and hdl has a lot of protein and very little cholesterol. ldl is the main source of artery clogging plaque. hdl actually works to clear cholesterol from the blood. triglycerides are another fat in our bloodstream. research is now showing that high levels of triglycerides are also linked to heart disease.",how does high cholesterol cause heart disease?,"['high cholesterol', 'heart disease']",wmd
