       " {'answer': 'yellowing of teeth is mainly due to one of the following or a combination of these: 1) tartar or plaque deposits (soft yellowish deposits) on the teeth. 2) calculus deposits (calcified hard deposits) on the teeth. 3) fluorosis - internal discoloration of the teeth due to altered fluorine content in the drinking water. you have given an excellent description of the clinical condition of your oral cavity. from your history it is very clear that the yellowness of your teeth is due to plaque and calculus deposits. plaque as you have mentioned is yellowish and creamy. this gets partially removed with brushing. calculi are hard deposits either yellowish greenish or sometimes blackish in color. they are firmly attached to the teeth and do not go off with brushing or tooth powder. even the abrasiveness of the tooth powder cannot remove the calculi. during childhood due to improper brushing there are chances of plaque and calculus formation over the teeth. because children at this age tend to be playful and do not concentrate on oral hygiene. \"tooth worms\" as people say are nothing but bacteria that affect the teeth. these bacteria act on the teeth and cause demineralization of the teeth and lead to tooth decay and cavities. the lower incisors and canines are more prone to plaque and calculus deposition (v shaped deposition in accordance with the tooth morphology) due to inability of us to reach the inner sides of these teeth while brushing. at this age of yours these deposits may be due to: 1) improper brushing technique. 2) brushing only once a day. 3) malalignment of your teeth. 4) crowding of your teeth (due to inadequate spacing in between the teeth). 5) if you are having any prosthetic teeth (crown bridge removable appliances). 6) if you are undergoing orthodontic treatment (wire braces). dental scaling is the procedure that removes plaque and calculi. but it does not mean that these deposits will not come back again. continuous oral hygiene maintenance after scaling is mandatory to prevent recurrence of plaque and calculi. hence scaling is not a wastage of money it is an investment to prevent one\\'s teeth and gums from infections and thereby increase the life of the teeth. so a permanent solution for your problem is to follow these steps to maintain oral hygiene: 1) brush with toothpaste and brush twice daily. the head of the toothbrush should be angulated in such a way that it reaches all the teeth and all the interior and hidden parts of the teeth. 2) use an antibacterial mouthwash only for the time period for which the dentist has prescribed. because long term use of mouthwash itself will cause staining of teeth. 3) rinse your mouth thoroughly soon after every meal. 4) in case you are wearing wire braces or prosthesis use the specific tooth brushes (orthodontic toothbrushes) to clean the teeth thoroughly well. 5) use interdental toothbrushes to clean the minute spaces in between the teeth. 6) visit a dentist once in every 6 months and get a scaling done if necessary. as your doctor has told regular use of colgate toothpaste is sufficient. sensodyne toothpaste is not needed for you since it is used for hypersensitive teeth. glodent toothpaste helps in stain removal and it can be used if extrinsic stains are present on the teeth. it does cause teeth whitening. regular use of mouthwash is not essential. you can use hexidine mouthwash for about two weeks and then stop it. bleaching is the procedure used to remove internal or intrinsic staining of the teeth which is not required for you. and finally pearl white color of the teeth indicate that they are unhealthy. teeth which are slightly yellow without any deposits on them are said to be healthy. hope this answer helps you. take care. consult a dentist online for further follow up  ',\n",

       " {'answer': 'you can bleed more sometimes due to irregular menses because of hormonal (chemical) levels of your body and its effect. but you can bleed also due to cervical erosions and infection there. i personally never recommend tampons. because your menstrual blood contains some bacteria and pathogens which can infect. and when you use tampons due to the collected blood it gives a media to growth of that bacteria. the body can resist infection up to a limit and as the limit crosses you get signs and symptoms of infection for which you may have to take treatment. now in your case foul-smelling discharge and discoloration of the discharge are the signs of infection. now i have to see actually where the infection is. so best consult your nearby gynecologist. let him see where the infection is and what type of discharge actually is. and if required then send the discharge for examination. by this we will know the type of infection and can give treatment accordingly. most probably you are having history which seems to be likely bacterial vaginosis. it is a mixed infection. you will need to take the antibiotic course for 10 to 15 days and follow some precautions to avoid recurrence. now as far as antibiotics are concerned i have to see the first type and nature of discharge and smell. so better get consulted nearby for that. kindly keep up the following precautions: do not use tampons. use pads and change more frequently during menses. keep the area around the vagina as dry as possible especially during menses. change underwear more frequently if required. use cotton underwear if possible. drink more water as your urine becomes clear. do clean vaginal area and immediately after urination and after every time you do sex. these will help to avoid recurrence. and firstly complete the drug course to completely eradicate the infection. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online  ',\n",

       " {'answer': 'from going through the information you have provided it is clear that currently you are on treatment for suspected gerd - gastroesophageal reflux disease (acid reflux disease). you have been having intermittent problems over five years. acid reflux can cause breathlessness and waking up from sleep at night. some might feel and describe heartburns but others may not actually feel the burning sensation. the symptoms can be worsened by stress anxiety and panic attacks. my recommendations are an endoscopy procedure called gastroscopy will help to check for any weakness in the valve at the lower end of the food pipe (gullet or esophagus) and to directly visualize any evidence of inflammation there that is reflux esophagitis. following the above test you may require a 24 hour ph monitoring study and a manometry test to confirm that acid is refluxing back whenever you have symptoms and that there is no problem with motility of the gullet. i agree with you that i would not continue on perinorm cd (metoclopramide). i tend to give it only for nausea or vomiting. nexpro (esomeprazole) 40 mg is best taken once daily in empty stomach in the morning. if despite this symptoms persist it can be taken twice daily before food that is before breakfast and the other before dinner at night. you can take topcid (famotidine) 40 mg at bedtime to prevent symptoms at night. some people with gerd may find that eliminating certain food helps to improve their symptoms. for example avoiding spicy foods raw onion garlic black pepper citrus products and juices of orange grapefruit or cranberry tomato products chocolate or brownies caffeine sodas coffee tea etc. peppermint fatty or greasy foods. eat smaller and frequent meals. try to eat more slowly try to spend at least 30 minutes per meal and avoid eating on the run. avoid large high fat meals. avoid late evening snacks or eating before bed. avoid lying flat after eating; try sitting up for at least two hours after finishing a meal and sleep on your left side. try light walking for 15 to 30 minutes following a meal. try chewing non-mint type chewing gum for 30 minutes following a meal. raise the head of the bed 6 to 8 inches to prevent reflux when sleeping. extra pillows may only elevate your head. try putting pillows under the mattress near the head of the bed or use a special wedge. avoid tight fitting clothes around the abdomen. i wish you a speedy recovery. investigations to be done:1. gastroscopy. 2. 24 hour esophageal ph monitoring and esophageal manometry. probable diagnosis:1. gerd. 2. functional dyspepsia. regarding follow up:for further information consult a medical gastroenterologist online. - ',\n",

       " {'answer': 'the symptoms you have mentioned here are indicating towards a migraine headache. however no diagnostic test can surely rule out a migraine. its diagnosis is mainly based on the symptoms. in a migraine there is no definite pain and pain occurs at any time. some people say that a migraine usually occurs on one side of the head and is accompanied by nausea and vomiting but this is not true in all cases. the pain can be all over the head and other symptoms might be present or absent. i suggest you try doing the following. wear sunglasses cover your head with a scarf and use an umbrella whenever you go out in the sun. before going outside always drink one glass of water it will keep you hydrated and will help you. you can take sandalwood oil and massage your scalp a night before washing your hair. avoid excessive intake of tea coffee and caffeinated drinks. some foods also increase the problem of headaches so avoid those. avoid using perfumes deodorant sprays etc. as strong smell may exaggerate the problem. avoid stress anxiety and loud noises. follow a particular sleep pattern i mean try to sleep daily around the same time. if possible try to avoid mobile television laptop etc. an hour before sleep as these emit blue light which hinders normal sleep pattern and also promotes headaches. pranayam is helpful in headaches. so if you can spare 5 to 10 minutes then practice it daily. in medications i suggest you try taking the following. consult your specialist doctor discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. pathyadi kwath 15 to 20 ml with an equal amount of water twice a day for six weeks. godanti bhasma 250 mg with water twice a day for four to six weeks. it is an ayurvedic painkiller. shir shuladi vajra ras two tablets twice a day with water for four to six weeks. this ayurvedic medicine is also a painkiller and is used in headaches of various etiology. if you find it tedious to take multiple medicines then you can take only one of these two painkillers or can take two of them for one month. kamdudha ras 250 mg twice a day with water for four to six weeks. it will help in cooling you down internally. take anu taila and put one drop of this oil in each nostril once a day for one month. take powder of sandalwood camphor and jatamansi and. mix all in equal amount and add water or rose water and apply this paste on the forehead while you have a headache. take one teaspoon of coriander powder and add it in one cup of water and keep it for a night. drink it early in the morning on an empty stomach. if you are taking allopathic medicine then take above medicine along with that after consulting your physician. however for a migraine there is no curative treatment. it can only be avoided with the help of medicines and lifestyle changes and sometimes the headache may not disturb you for so long and sometimes may trouble you often so follow a healthy way of life. also stop these medicines during your periods. you can start them after the period gets over. i hope you are satisfied with my answer. for further queries consult an ayurveda specialist online  ',\n",

       " {'answer': 'combined oral contraceptive pill (cocp) is absolutely safe for her. it does not cause cancer (low dose cocp). just check the content of cocp which she is taking. if dose of estrogen (ethinyl estradiol) is 20 or 30 mcg she can safely continue the medicine. in fact cocp in such a case prevents endometrial cancer due to its progesterone content. regarding missed period it normally does not happen with cocp. normally period starts between 3 and 15 days of stopping the last tablet in the pack. if it has been more than 15 days since last tablet consult a gynecologist. if it has been less than 15 days she can wait till 15 days from last pill for periods to come. in any case she cannot start next pack without having periods unless instructed by doctor after examination. do not forget to tell her to use another form of contraception like condom if she is sexually active. for further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online  ',\n",

       " {'answer': 'the best way to reduce weight is by regular physical exercise and balanced diet. you can lose weight by reducing your intake of oily food and sweets. it is also important to space your meals in such a way that you have more frequent small meals (and not heavy meals). regular physical exercise in the form of some cardio and strength training will make you fit and strong. sleep and hydration are equally important when you try to lose weight. ensure that you take lots of fluids and that you get at least 6-8 hours of sleep per day. medicine to lose weight: as a doctor i never really recommend my patients to take medicines to lose weight. only one drug is approved for use in india- orlistat. if you really want to take it you can take tablet orlistat 60mg thrice a day (after your 3 major meals). as i have seen in practice and also research results say that orlistat does not produce too much change in weight. it shows just a small percentage of weight loss when coupled with low-calorie diet and exercise. and orlistat has its own share of side effects: fatty/oily stool oily spotting intestinal gas with discharge a feeling of needing to have a bowel movement right away increased number of bowel movements or poor bowel control. rare but serious side effects can occur: symptoms of liver disease (such as persistent nausea/vomiting severe stomach/abdominal pain dark urine yellowing eyes/skin) symptoms of kidney stones (such as back pain pain while urinating pink/bloody urine). bottom line: i do not recommend medicines for weight loss. i can make a good diet chart and exercise regimen for you if you would like to follow up in which case you will have to get back to me with your details- your daily food routine your work timings your daily sleep cycle the kind of exercises you prefer etc. i hope that answers your question. revert back to a fitness expert online  ',\n",
